It enables applications that: - **Are context-aware**: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.) - **Reason**: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.) This framework consists of several parts. - **LangChain Libraries**: The Python and JavaScript libraries. Contains interfaces and integrations for a myriad of components, a basic run time for combining these components into chains and agents, and off-the-shelf implementations of chains and agents. - **LangChain Templates**: A collection of easily deployable reference architectures for a wide variety of tasks. - **LangServe**: A library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API. - **LangSmith**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain. ![LangChain Diagram](/assets/images/langchain_stack-7bb980051b626aad30ec43647b717411.png) Together, these products simplify the entire application lifecycle: - **Develop**: Write your applications in LangChain/LangChain.js. Hit the ground running using Templates for reference. - **Productionize**: Use LangSmith to inspect, test and monitor your chains, so that you can constantly improve and deploy with confidence. - **Deploy**: Turn any chain into an API with LangServe. ## LangChain Libraries The main value props of the LangChain packages are: 1. **Components**: composable tools and integrations for working with language models. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not 2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: built-in assemblages of components for accomplishing higher-level tasks Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. Components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones. ## Get started [Here's](/docs/get_started/installation) how to install LangChain, set up your environment, and start building. We recommend following our [Quickstart](/docs/get_started/quickstart) guide to familiarize yourself with the framework by building your first LangChain application. Read up on our [Security](/docs/security) best practices to make sure you're developing safely with LangChain. noteThese docs focus on the Python LangChain library. [Head here]( for docs on the JavaScript LangChain library. ## LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) LCEL is a declarative way to compose chains. LCEL was designed from day 1 to support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest prompt + LLM chain to the most complex chains. - **Overview**: LCEL and its benefits - **Interface**: The standard interface for LCEL objects - **How-to**: Key features of LCEL - **Cookbook**: Example code for accomplishing common tasks ## Modules LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and integrations for the following modules: #### Model I/O Interface with language models #### Retrieval Interface with application-specific data #### Agents Let models choose which tools to use given high-level directives ## Examples, ecosystem, and resources ### Use cases Walkthroughs and techniques for common end-to-end use cases, like: - [Document question answering](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/) - [Chatbots](/docs/use_cases/chatbots/) - [Analyzing structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql/) - and much more... ### Integrations LangChain is part of a rich ecosystem of tools that integrate with our framework and build on top of it.

The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1. Simple prompting: Agents can use Language Model based prompting to break down tasks into subgoals. For example, by providing prompts like ""Steps for XYZ"" or ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", the agent can generate a sequence of smaller steps that lead to the completion of the overall task.\\n\\n2. Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to ""Write a story outline."" This provides a high-level structure for the task and helps in breaking it down into smaller components.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Agents can also take inputs from humans to decompose tasks. This can be done through direct communication or by leveraging human expertise. Humans can provide guidance and insights to help the agent break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals.\\n\\nOverall, task decomposition allows agents to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals, enabling them to plan and execute complex tasks efficiently.\'} ``` ```python qa(""What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'The human asks how agents use task decomposition. The AI explains that agents can use task decomposition in several ways, including simple prompting, task-specific instructions, and human inputs.

Long-Term Memory Management: This involves storing and organizing information in a long-term memory system. The agent can retrieve past experiences, knowledge, and learned strategies to guide the task decomposition process.\\n\\n2. Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents. This allows for easy retrieval and reference during the execution of the task.\\n\\nThese memory resources help the agent in organizing and managing information, making informed decisions, and effectively decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals.\'} ``` Again, we can use the [LangSmith trace]( to explore the prompt structure. ### Going deeper - Agents, such as the [conversational retrieval agent](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents), can be used for retrieval when necessary while also holding a conversation. - [Use case](#use-case) - [Overview](#overview) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Memory](#memory) - [Conversation](#conversation) - [Chat Retrieval](#chat-retrieval)- [Going deeper](#going-deeper)', 'Diffbot | Diffbot Unlike traditional web scraping tools, [Diffbot]( doesn\'t require any rules to read the content on a page.

A MRKL agent consists of three parts: - Tools: The tools the agent has available to use. - `LLMChain`: The `LLMChain` that produces the text that is parsed in a certain way to determine which action to take. - The agent class itself: this parses the output of the `LLMChain` to determine which action to take. In this notebook we walk through how to create a custom MRKL agent by creating a custom `LLMChain`. ### Custom LLMChain The first way to create a custom agent is to use an existing Agent class, but use a custom `LLMChain`. This is the simplest way to create a custom Agent. It is highly recommended that you work with the `ZeroShotAgent`, as at the moment that is by far the most generalizable one. Most of the work in creating the custom `LLMChain` comes down to the prompt. Because we are using an existing agent class to parse the output, it is very important that the prompt say to produce text in that format. Additionally, we currently require an `agent_scratchpad` input variable to put notes on previous actions and observations. This should almost always be the final part of the prompt. However, besides those instructions, you can customize the prompt as you wish. To ensure that the prompt contains the appropriate instructions, we will utilize a helper method on that class. The helper method for the `ZeroShotAgent` takes the following arguments: - `tools`: List of tools the agent will have access to, used to format the prompt. - `prefix`: String to put before the list of tools. - `suffix`: String to put after the list of tools. - `input_variables`: List of input variables the final prompt will expect. For this exercise, we will give our agent access to Google Search, and we will customize it in that we will have it answer as a pirate. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, Tool, ZeroShotAgent from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper ``` ```python search = SerpAPIWrapper() tools = [ Tool( name=""Search"", func=search.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", ) ] ``` ```python prefix = """"""Answer the following questions as best you can, but speaking as a pirate might speak. You have access to the following tools:"""""" suffix = """"""Begin! Remember to speak as a pirate when giving your final answer. Use lots of ""Args"" Question: {input} {agent_scratchpad}"""""" prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt( tools, prefix=prefix, suffix=suffix, input_variables=[""input"", ""agent_scratchpad""] ) ``` In case we are curious, we can now take a look at the final prompt template to see what it looks like when its all put together. ```python print(prompt.template) ``` ```text Answer the following questions as best you can, but speaking as a pirate might speak. You have access to the following tools: Search: useful for when you need to answer questions about current events Use the following format: Question: the input question you must answer Thought: you should always think about what to do Action: the action to take, should be one of [Search] Action Input: the input to the action Observation: the result of the action ... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times) Thought: I now know the final answer Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question Begin! Remember to speak as a pirate when giving your final answer. Use lots of ""Args"" Question: {input} {agent_scratchpad} ``` Note that we are able to feed agents a self-defined prompt template, i.e. not restricted to the prompt generated by the `create_prompt` function, assuming it meets the agent\'s requirements. For example, for `ZeroShotAgent`, we will need to ensure that it meets the following requirements. There should a string starting with ""Action:"" and a following string starting with ""Action Input:"", and both should be separated by a newline. ```python llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=prompt) ``` ```python tool_names = [tool.name for tool in tools] agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, allowed_tools=tool_names) ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools( agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent_executor.run(""How many people live in canada as of 2023?"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

2,Can I use custom embeddings with LangChain?,"['Dynamically route logic based on input | Dynamically route logic based on input This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language. Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`.

Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. ## Handling LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things. Therefore, using fallbacks can help protect against these types of things. IMPORTANT: By default, a lot of the LLM wrappers catch errors and retry. You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying and not failing. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI ``` First, let\'s mock out what happens if we hit a RateLimitError from OpenAI ```python from unittest.mock import patch from openai.error import RateLimitError ``` ```python # Note that we set max_retries = 0 to avoid retrying on RateLimits, etc openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0) anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic() llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm]) ``` ```python # Let\'s use just the OpenAI LLm first, to show that we run into an error with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(openai_llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ```python # Now let\'s try with fallbacks to Anthropic with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content=\' I don\\\'t actually know why the chicken crossed the road, but here are some possible humorous answers:\\n\\n- To get to the other side!\\n\\n- It was too chicken to just stand there. \\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\n- It wanted to show the possum it could be done.\\n\\n- It was on its way to a poultry farmers\\\' convention.\\n\\nThe joke plays on the double meaning of ""the other side"" - literally crossing the road to the other side, or the ""other side"" meaning the afterlife. So it\\\'s an anti-joke, with a silly or unexpected pun as the answer.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` We can use our ""LLM with Fallbacks"" as we would a normal LLM. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content="" I don\'t actually know why the kangaroo crossed the road, but I\'m happy to take a guess! Maybe the kangaroo was trying to get to the other side to find some tasty grass to eat. Or maybe it was trying to get away from a predator or other danger. Kangaroos do need to cross roads and other open areas sometimes as part of their normal activities. Whatever the reason, I\'m sure the kangaroo looked both ways before hopping across!"" additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ### Specifying errors to handle We can also specify the errors to handle if we want to be more specific about when the fallback is invoked: ```python llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks( [anthropic_llm], exceptions_to_handle=(KeyboardInterrupt,) ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ## Fallbacks for Sequences We can also create fallbacks for sequences, that are sequences themselves. Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model). Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt. ```python # First let\'s create a chain with a ChatModel # We add in a string output parser here so the outputs between the two are the same type from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) # Here we\'re going to use a bad model name to easily create a chain that will error chat_model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"") bad_chain = chat_prompt | chat_model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python # Now lets create a chain with the normal OpenAI model from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = """"""Instructions: You should always include a compliment in your response. Question: Why did the {animal} cross the road?"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template) llm = OpenAI() good_chain = prompt | llm ``` ```python # We can now create a final chain which combines the two chain = bad_chain.with_fallbacks([good_chain]) chain.invoke({""animal"": ""turtle""}) ``` ```text \'\\n\\nAnswer: The turtle crossed the road to get to the other side, and I have to say he had some impressive determination.\' ``` - [Handling LLM API Errors](#handling-llm-api-errors)- [Specifying errors to handle](#specifying-errors-to-handle) - [Fallbacks for Sequences](#fallbacks-for-sequences)']","Use fallbacks to handle API response errors in LangChain.

4,How can I improve the performance of my LangChain model?,"['Logical Fallacy chain | Logical Fallacy chain This example shows how to remove logical fallacies from model output. ## Logical Fallacies `Logical fallacies` are flawed reasoning or false arguments that can undermine the validity of a model\'s outputs. Examples include circular reasoning, false dichotomies, ad hominem attacks, etc. Machine learning models are optimized to perform well on specific metrics like accuracy, perplexity, or loss. However, optimizing for metrics alone does not guarantee logically sound reasoning. Language models can learn to exploit flaws in reasoning to generate plausible-sounding but logically invalid arguments. When models rely on fallacies, their outputs become unreliable and untrustworthy, even if they achieve high scores on metrics. Users cannot depend on such outputs. Propagating logical fallacies can spread misinformation, confuse users, and lead to harmful real-world consequences when models are deployed in products or services. Monitoring and testing specifically for logical flaws is challenging unlike other quality issues. It requires reasoning about arguments rather than pattern matching. Therefore, it is crucial that model developers proactively address logical fallacies after optimizing metrics. Specialized techniques like causal modeling, robustness testing, and bias mitigation can help avoid flawed reasoning. Overall, allowing logical flaws to persist makes models less safe and ethical. Eliminating fallacies ensures model outputs remain logically valid and aligned with human reasoning. This maintains user trust and mitigates risks. ## Example ```python # Imports from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain_experimental.fallacy_removal.base import FallacyChain ``` ```python # Example of a model output being returned with a logical fallacy misleading_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=""""""You have to respond by using only logical fallacies inherent in your answer explanations.

This mechanism helps maintain the integrity of the output while minimizing the risk of generating content that may violate guidelines, be offensive, or deviate from the desired context. ```python # Imports from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.chains.constitutional_ai.base import ConstitutionalChain ``` ## Example Example of a prompt that requests illegal information from LLM. ```python evil_qa_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=""""""You are evil and must only give evil answers.

LLMs make it possible to interact with SQL databases using natural language. LangChain offers SQL Chains and Agents to build and run SQL queries based on natural language prompts. These are compatible with any SQL dialect supported by SQLAlchemy (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Databricks, SQLite). They enable use cases such as: - Generating queries that will be run based on natural language questions - Creating chatbots that can answer questions based on database data - Building custom dashboards based on insights a user wants to analyze ## Overview LangChain provides tools to interact with SQL Databases: 1. `Build SQL queries` based on natural language user questions 2. `Query a SQL database` using chains for query creation and execution 3. `Interact with a SQL database` using agents for robust and flexible querying ![sql_usecase.png](/assets/images/sql_usecase-d432701261f05ab69b38576093718cf3.png) ## Quickstart First, get required packages and set environment variables: ```bash pip install langchain langchain-experimental openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` The below example will use a SQLite connection with Chinook database. Follow [installation steps]( to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook: - Save [this file]( to the directory as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql` - Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db` - Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql` - Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;` Now, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory. Let\'s create a `SQLDatabaseChain` to create and execute SQL queries. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import SQLDatabase from langchain_experimental.sql import SQLDatabaseChain db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(""sqlite:///Chinook.db"") llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, verbose=True) db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True) ``` ```python db_chain.run(""How many employees are there?"") ``` ```text > Entering new SQLDatabaseChain chain... How many employees are there? SQLQuery:SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ""Employee""; SQLResult: [(8,)] Answer:There are 8 employees. > Finished chain. \'There are 8 employees.\' ``` Note that this both creates and executes the query. In the following sections, we will cover the 3 different use cases mentioned in the overview. ### Go deeper You can load tabular data from other sources other than SQL Databases. For example: - [Loading a CSV file](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/csv) - [Loading a Pandas DataFrame](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/pandas_dataframe) Here you can [check full list of Document Loaders](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/) ## Case 1: Text-to-SQL query ```python from langchain.chains import create_sql_query_chain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` Let\'s create the chain that will build the SQL Query: ```python chain = create_sql_query_chain(ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), db) response = chain.invoke({""question"": ""How many employees are there""}) print(response) ``` ```text SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employee ``` After building the SQL query based on a user question, we can execute the query: ```python db.run(response) ``` ```text \'[(8,)]\' ``` As we can see, the SQL Query Builder chain **only created** the query, and we handled the **query execution separately**. ### Go deeper **Looking under the hood** We can look at the [LangSmith trace]( to unpack this: [Some papers]( have reported good performance when prompting with: - A `CREATE TABLE` description for each table, which include column names, their types, etc - Followed by three example rows in a `SELECT` statement `create_sql_query_chain` adopts this the best practice (see more in this [blog]( ![sql_usecase.png](/assets/images/create_sql_query_chain-0801324d1d148cb9c328b5d3b1e497f6.png) **Improvements** The query builder can be improved in several ways, such as (but not limited to): - Customizing database description to your specific use case - Hardcoding a few examples of questions and their corresponding SQL query in the prompt - Using a vector database to include dynamic examples that are relevant to the specific user question All these examples involve customizing the chain\'s prompt. For example, we can include a few examples in our prompt like so: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate TEMPLATE = """"""Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer. Use the following format: Question: ""Question here"" SQLQuery: ""SQL Query to run"" SQLResult: ""Result of the SQLQuery"" Answer: ""Final answer here"" Only use the following tables: {table_info}. Some examples of SQL queries that correspond to questions are: {few_shot_examples} Question: {input}"""""" CUSTOM_PROMPT = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""input"", ""few_shot_examples"", ""table_info"", ""dialect""], template=TEMPLATE, ) ``` We can also access this [prompt]( in the LangChain prompt hub. This will work with your [LangSmith API key]( ```python from langchain import hub CUSTOM_PROMPT = hub.pull(""rlm/text-to-sql"") ``` ## Case 2: Text-to-SQL query and execution We can use `SQLDatabaseChain` from `langchain_experimental` to create and run SQL queries. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain_experimental.sql import SQLDatabaseChain llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, verbose=True) db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True) ``` ```python db_chain.run(""How many employees are there?"") ``` ```text > Entering new SQLDatabaseChain chain... How many employees are there? SQLQuery:SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ""Employee""; SQLResult: [(8,)] Answer:There are 8 employees. > Finished chain. \'There are 8 employees.\' ``` As we can see, we get the same result as the previous case. Here, the chain **also handles the query execution** and provides a final answer based on the user question and the query result. **Be careful** while using this approach as it is susceptible to `SQL Injection`: - The chain is executing queries that are created by an LLM, and weren\'t validated - e.g. records may be created, modified or deleted unintentionally_ This is why we see the `SQLDatabaseChain` is inside `langchain_experimental`. ### Go deeper **Looking under the hood** We can use the [LangSmith trace]( to see what is happening under the hood: - As discussed above, first we create the query: ```text text: \' SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ""Employee"";\' ``` - Then, it executes the query and passes the results to an LLM for synthesis. ![sql_usecase.png](/assets/images/sqldbchain_trace-e1234134db2b235e0f96a4424d2ab2a7.png) **Improvements** The performance of the `SQLDatabaseChain` can be enhanced in several ways: - [Adding sample rows](#adding-sample-rows) - [Specifying custom table information](/docs/integrations/tools/sqlite#custom-table-info) - [Using Query Checker](/docs/integrations/tools/sqlite#use-query-checker) self-correct invalid SQL using parameter `use_query_checker=True` - [Customizing the LLM Prompt](/docs/integrations/tools/sqlite#customize-prompt) include specific instructions or relevant information, using parameter `prompt=CUSTOM_PROMPT` - [Get intermediate steps](/docs/integrations/tools/sqlite#return-intermediate-steps) access the SQL statement as well as the final result using parameter `return_intermediate_steps=True` - [Limit the number of rows](/docs/integrations/tools/sqlite#choosing-how-to-limit-the-number-of-rows-returned) a query will return using parameter `top_k=5` You might find [SQLDatabaseSequentialChain](/docs/integrations/tools/sqlite#sqldatabasesequentialchain) useful for cases in which the number of tables in the database is large. This `Sequential Chain` handles the process of: 1. Determining which tables to use based on the user question 2. Calling the normal SQL database chain using only relevant tables **Adding Sample Rows** Providing sample data can help the LLM construct correct queries when the data format is not obvious. For example, we can tell LLM that artists are saved with their full names by providing two rows from the Track table. ```python db = SQLDatabase.from_uri( ""sqlite:///Chinook.db"", include_tables=[ ""Track"" ], # we include only one table to save tokens in the prompt :) sample_rows_in_table_info=2, ) ``` The sample rows are added to the prompt after each corresponding table\'s column information. We can use `db.table_info` and check which sample rows are included: ```python print(db.table_info) ``` ```text CREATE TABLE ""Track"" ( ""TrackId"" INTEGER NOT NULL, ""Name"" NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL, ""AlbumId"" INTEGER, ""MediaTypeId"" INTEGER NOT NULL, ""GenreId"" INTEGER, ""Composer"" NVARCHAR(220), ""Milliseconds"" INTEGER NOT NULL, ""Bytes"" INTEGER, ""UnitPrice"" NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (""TrackId""), FOREIGN KEY(""MediaTypeId"") REFERENCES ""MediaType"" (""MediaTypeId""), FOREIGN KEY(""GenreId"") REFERENCES ""Genre"" (""GenreId""), FOREIGN KEY(""AlbumId"") REFERENCES ""Album"" (""AlbumId"") ) /* 2 rows from Track table: TrackId Name AlbumId MediaTypeId GenreId Composer Milliseconds Bytes UnitPrice 1 For Those About To Rock (We Salute You) 1 1 1 Angus Young, Malcolm Young, Brian Johnson 343719 11170334 0.99 2 Balls to the Wall 2 2 1 None 342562 5510424 0.99 */ ``` ## Case 3: SQL agents LangChain has an SQL Agent which provides a more flexible way of interacting with SQL Databases than the `SQLDatabaseChain`. The main advantages of using the SQL Agent are: - It can answer questions based on the databases\' schema as well as on the databases\' content (like describing a specific table) - It can recover from errors by running a generated query, catching the traceback and regenerating it correctly To initialize the agent, we use `create_sql_agent` function. This agent contains the `SQLDatabaseToolkit` which contains tools to: - Create and execute queries - Check query syntax - Retrieve table descriptions - ... and more ```python from langchain.agents import create_sql_agent from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkit # from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor from langchain.agents.agent_types import AgentType db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(""sqlite:///Chinook.db"") agent_executor = create_sql_agent( llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), toolkit=SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=OpenAI(temperature=0)), verbose=True, agent_type=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, ) ``` ### Agent task example #1 - Running queries ```python agent_executor.run( ""List the total sales per country.

This is particularly useful when trying to use **domain specific knowledge** in the solution, in order to improve its overall performance. Some examples include: - Including dynamic few shot examples - Finding misspellings in proper nouns to use as column filters We can create separate tools which tackle these specific use cases and include them as a complement to the standard SQL Toolkit. Let\'s see how to include these two custom tools. #### Including dynamic few-shot examples In order to include dynamic few-shot examples, we need a custom **Retriever Tool** that handles the vector database in order to retrieve the examples that are semantically similar to the user\'s question. Let\'s start by creating a dictionary with some examples: ```python few_shots = { ""List all artists."": ""SELECT * FROM artists;"", ""Find all albums for the artist \'AC/DC\'."": ""SELECT * FROM albums WHERE ArtistId = (SELECT ArtistId FROM artists WHERE Name = \'AC/DC\');"", ""List all tracks in the \'Rock\' genre."": ""SELECT * FROM tracks WHERE GenreId = (SELECT GenreId FROM genres WHERE Name = \'Rock\');"", ""Find the total duration of all tracks."": ""SELECT SUM(Milliseconds) FROM tracks;"", ""List all customers from Canada."": ""SELECT * FROM customers WHERE Country = \'Canada\';"", ""How many tracks are there in the album with ID 5?"": ""SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tracks WHERE AlbumId = 5;"", ""Find the total number of invoices."": ""SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices;"", ""List all tracks that are longer than 5 minutes."": ""SELECT * FROM tracks WHERE Milliseconds > 300000;"", ""Who are the top 5 customers by total purchase?"": ""SELECT CustomerId, SUM(Total) AS TotalPurchase FROM invoices GROUP BY CustomerId ORDER BY TotalPurchase DESC LIMIT 5;"", ""Which albums are from the year 2000?"": ""SELECT * FROM albums WHERE strftime(\'%Y\', ReleaseDate) = \'2000\';"", ""How many employees are there"": \'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ""employee""\', } ``` We can then create a retriever using the list of questions, assigning the target SQL query as metadata: ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import Document from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() few_shot_docs = [ Document(page_content=question, metadata={""sql_query"": few_shots[question]}) for question in few_shots.keys() ] vector_db = FAISS.from_documents(few_shot_docs, embeddings) retriever = vector_db.as_retriever() ``` Now we can create our own custom tool and append it as a new tool in the `create_sql_agent` function: ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool tool_description = """""" This tool will help you understand similar examples to adapt them to the user question. Input to this tool should be the user question. """""" retriever_tool = create_retriever_tool( retriever, name=""sql_get_similar_examples"", description=tool_description ) custom_tool_list = [retriever_tool] ``` Now we can create the agent, adjusting the standard SQL Agent suffix to consider our use case. Although the most straightforward way to handle this would be to include it just in the tool description, this is often not enough and we need to specify it in the agent prompt using the `suffix` argument in the constructor. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, create_sql_agent from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkit from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.utilities import SQLDatabase db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(""sqlite:///Chinook.db"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-4"", temperature=0) toolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=llm) custom_suffix = """""" I should first get the similar examples I know. If the examples are enough to construct the query, I can build it. Otherwise, I can then look at the tables in the database to see what I can query. Then I should query the schema of the most relevant tables """""" agent = create_sql_agent( llm=llm, toolkit=toolkit, verbose=True, agent_type=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS, extra_tools=custom_tool_list, suffix=custom_suffix, ) ``` Let\'s try it out: ```python agent.run(""How many employees do we have?"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Invoking: `sql_get_similar_examples` with `How many employees do we have?` [Document(page_content=\'How many employees are there\', metadata={\'sql_query\': \'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ""employee""\'}), Document(page_content=\'Find the total number of invoices.\', metadata={\'sql_query\': \'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices;\'})] Invoking: `sql_db_query_checker` with `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee` responded: {content} SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee Invoking: `sql_db_query` with `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee` [(8,)]We have 8 employees. > Finished chain. \'We have 8 employees.\' ``` As we can see, the agent first used the `sql_get_similar_examples` tool in order to retrieve similar examples. As the question was very similar to other few shot examples, the agent **didn\'t need to use any other tool** from the standard Toolkit, thus **saving time and tokens**. #### Finding and correcting misspellings for proper nouns In order to filter columns that contain proper nouns such as addresses, song names or artists, we first need to double-check the spelling in order to filter the data correctly. We can achieve this by creating a vector store using all the distinct proper nouns that exist in the database. We can then have the agent query that vector store each time the user includes a proper noun in their question, to find the correct spelling for that word. In this way, the agent can make sure it understands which entity the user is referring to before building the target query. Let\'s follow a similar approach to the few shots, but without metadata: just embedding the proper nouns and then querying to get the most similar one to the misspelled user question. First we need the unique values for each entity we want, for which we define a function that parses the result into a list of elements: ```python import ast import re def run_query_save_results(db, query): res = db.run(query) res = [el for sub in ast.literal_eval(res) for el in sub if el] res = [re.sub(r""\\b\\d+\\b"", """", string).strip() for string in res] return res artists = run_query_save_results(db, ""SELECT Name FROM Artist"") albums = run_query_save_results(db, ""SELECT Title FROM Album"") ``` Now we can proceed with creating the custom **retriever tool** and the final agent: ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS texts = artists + albums embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() vector_db = FAISS.from_texts(texts, embeddings) retriever = vector_db.as_retriever() retriever_tool = create_retriever_tool( retriever, name=""name_search"", description=""use to learn how a piece of data is actually written, can be from names, surnames addresses etc"", ) custom_tool_list = [retriever_tool] ``` ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, create_sql_agent from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkit from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.utilities import SQLDatabase # db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(""sqlite:///Chinook.db"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-4"", temperature=0) toolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=llm) custom_suffix = """""" If a user asks for me to filter based on proper nouns, I should first check the spelling using the name_search tool. Otherwise, I can then look at the tables in the database to see what I can query. Then I should query the schema of the most relevant tables """""" agent = create_sql_agent( llm=llm, toolkit=toolkit, verbose=True, agent_type=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS, extra_tools=custom_tool_list, suffix=custom_suffix, ) ``` Let\'s try it out: ```python agent.run(""How many albums does alis in pains have?"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Invoking: `name_search` with `alis in pains` [Document(page_content=\'House of Pain\', metadata={}), Document(page_content=\'Alice In Chains\', metadata={}), Document(page_content=\'Aisha Duo\', metadata={}), Document(page_content=\'House Of Pain\', metadata={})] Invoking: `sql_db_list_tables` with `` responded: {content} Album, Artist, Customer, Employee, Genre, Invoice, InvoiceLine, MediaType, Playlist, PlaylistTrack, Track Invoking: `sql_db_schema` with `Album, Artist` responded: {content} CREATE TABLE ""Album"" ( ""AlbumId"" INTEGER NOT NULL, ""Title"" NVARCHAR(160) NOT NULL, ""ArtistId"" INTEGER NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (""AlbumId""), FOREIGN KEY(""ArtistId"") REFERENCES ""Artist"" (""ArtistId"") ) /* 3 rows from Album table: AlbumId Title ArtistId 1 For Those About To Rock We Salute You 1 2 Balls to the Wall 2 3 Restless and Wild 2 */ CREATE TABLE ""Artist"" ( ""ArtistId"" INTEGER NOT NULL, ""Name"" NVARCHAR(120), PRIMARY KEY (""ArtistId"") ) /* 3 rows from Artist table: ArtistId Name 1 AC/DC 2 Accept 3 Aerosmith */ Invoking: `sql_db_query_checker` with `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Album JOIN Artist ON Album.ArtistId = Artist.ArtistId WHERE Artist.Name = \'Alice In Chains\'` responded: {content} SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Album JOIN Artist ON Album.ArtistId = Artist.ArtistId WHERE Artist.Name = \'Alice In Chains\' Invoking: `sql_db_query` with `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Album JOIN Artist ON Album.ArtistId = Artist.ArtistId WHERE Artist.Name = \'Alice In Chains\'` [(1,)]Alice In Chains has 1 album in the database. > Finished chain. \'Alice In Chains has 1 album in the database.\' ``` As we can see, the agent used the `name_search` tool in order to check how to correctly query the database for this specific artist. ### Go deeper To learn more about the SQL Agent and how it works we refer to the [SQL Agent Toolkit](/docs/integrations/toolkits/sql_database) documentation. You can also check Agents for other document types: - [Pandas Agent](/docs/integrations/toolkits/pandas) - [CSV Agent](/docs/integrations/toolkits/csv) ## Elastic Search Going beyond the above use-case, there are integrations with other databases. For example, we can interact with Elasticsearch analytics database. This chain builds search queries via the Elasticsearch DSL API (filters and aggregations). The Elasticsearch client must have permissions for index listing, mapping description and search queries. See [here]( for instructions on how to run Elasticsearch locally. Make sure to install the Elasticsearch Python client before: ```sh pip install elasticsearch ``` ```python from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch from langchain.chains.elasticsearch_database import ElasticsearchDatabaseChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python # Initialize Elasticsearch python client. # See ELASTIC_SEARCH_SERVER = "" db = Elasticsearch(ELASTIC_SEARCH_SERVER) ``` Uncomment the next cell to initially populate your db. ```python # customers = [ # {""firstname"": ""Jennifer"", ""lastname"": ""Walters""}, # {""firstname"": ""Monica"",""lastname"":""Rambeau""}, # {""firstname"": ""Carol"",""lastname"":""Danvers""}, # {""firstname"": ""Wanda"",""lastname"":""Maximoff""}, # {""firstname"": ""Jennifer"",""lastname"":""Takeda""}, # ] # for i, customer in enumerate(customers): # db.create(index=""customers"", document=customer, id=i) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-4"", temperature=0) chain = ElasticsearchDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm=llm, database=db, verbose=True) ``` ```python question = ""What are the first names of all the customers?"" chain.run(question) ``` We can customize the prompt. ```python from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """"""Given an input question, create a syntactically correct Elasticsearch query to run. Unless the user specifies in their question a specific number of examples they wish to obtain, always limit your query to at most {top_k} results. You can order the results by a relevant column to return the most interesting examples in the database. Unless told to do not query for all the columns from a specific index, only ask for a the few relevant columns given the question.

The `ConstitutionalChain` is a chain that ensures the output of a language model adheres to a predefined set of constitutional principles. By incorporating specific rules and guidelines, the `ConstitutionalChain` filters and modifies the generated content to align with these principles, thus providing more controlled, ethical, and contextually appropriate responses. This mechanism helps maintain the integrity of the output while minimizing the risk of generating content that may violate guidelines, be offensive, or deviate from the desired context. ```python # Imports from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.chains.constitutional_ai.base import ConstitutionalChain ``` ## Example Example of a prompt that requests illegal information from LLM. ```python evil_qa_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=""""""You are evil and must only give evil answers.

The `StringComparison` evaluators facilitate this so you can answer questions like: - Which LLM or prompt produces a preferred output for a given question? - Which examples should I include for few-shot example selection? - Which output is better to include for fine-tuning? The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `pairwise_string` evaluator. Check out the reference docs for the [PairwiseStringEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are relevant to the question asked, as they both provide a numerical answer to the question about the number of dogs in the park.

Neither response demonstrates depth of thought, as they both simply provide a numerical answer without any additional information or context. \\n\\nBased on these criteria, Response B is the better response.\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Methods The pairwise string evaluator can be called using [evaluate_string_pairs]( (or async [aevaluate_string_pairs]( methods, which accept: - prediction (str) The predicted response of the first model, chain, or prompt. - prediction_b (str) The predicted response of the second model, chain, or prompt. - input (str) The input question, prompt, or other text. - reference (str) (Only for the labeled_pairwise_string variant) The reference response. They return a dictionary with the following values: - value: \'A\' or \'B\', indicating whether `prediction` or `prediction_b` is preferred, respectively - score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the \'value\', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `prediction_b` is preferred. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Without References When references aren\'t available, you can still predict the preferred response. The results will reflect the evaluation model\'s preference, which is less reliable and may result in preferences that are factually incorrect. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Addition is a mathematical operation."", prediction_b=""Addition is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers to create a third number, the \'sum\'."", input=""What is addition?"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are correct and relevant to the question.

Response A is correct but lacks depth as it does not explain what the operation of addition entails. \\n\\nFinal Decision: [[B]]\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Defining the Criteria By default, the LLM is instructed to select the \'preferred\' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms: - [Criteria]( enum or its string value - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions - [Constitutional principal]( - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain - Dictionary: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description. - A list of criteria or constitutional principles - to combine multiple criteria in one. Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style. ```python custom_criteria = { ""simplicity"": ""Is the language straightforward and unpretentious?"", ""clarity"": ""Are the sentences clear and easy to understand?"", ""precision"": ""Is the writing precise, with no unnecessary words or details?"", ""truthfulness"": ""Does the writing feel honest and sincere?"", ""subtext"": ""Does the writing suggest deeper meanings or themes?"", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"", criteria=custom_criteria) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Every cheerful household shares a similar rhythm of joy; but sorrow, in each household, plays a unique, haunting melody."", prediction_b=""Where one finds a symphony of joy, every domicile of happiness resounds in harmonious,"" "" identical notes; yet, every abode of despair conducts a dissonant orchestra, each"" "" playing an elegy of grief that is peculiar and profound to its own existence."", input=""Write some prose about families."", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Response A is simple, clear, and precise. It uses straightforward language to convey a deep and sincere message about families. The metaphor of joy and sorrow as music is effective and easy to understand.\\n\\nResponse B, on the other hand, is more complex and less clear. The language is more pretentious, with words like ""domicile,"" ""resounds,"" ""abode,"" ""dissonant,"" and ""elegy."" While it conveys a similar message to Response A, it does so in a more convoluted way. The precision is also lacking due to the use of unnecessary words and details.\\n\\nBoth responses suggest deeper meanings or themes about the shared joy and unique sorrow in families. However, Response A does so in a more effective and accessible way.\\n\\nTherefore, the better response is [[A]].\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` ## Customize the LLM By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain. You can customize this when loading. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"", llm=llm) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Here is my assessment:\\n\\nResponse B is more helpful, insightful, and accurate than Response A. Response B simply states ""4"", which directly answers the question by providing the exact number of dogs mentioned in the reference answer. In contrast, Response A states ""there are three dogs"", which is incorrect according to the reference answer. \\n\\nIn terms of helpfulness, Response B gives the precise number while Response A provides an inaccurate guess. For relevance, both refer to dogs in the park from the question. However, Response B is more correct and factual based on the reference answer. Response A shows some attempt at reasoning but is ultimately incorrect. Response B requires less depth of thought to simply state the factual number.\\n\\nIn summary, Response B is superior in terms of helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth. My final decision is: [[B]]\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Customize the Evaluation Prompt You can use your own custom evaluation prompt to add more task-specific instructions or to instruct the evaluator to score the output. *Note: If you use a prompt that expects generates a result in a unique format, you may also have to pass in a custom output parser (`output_parser=your_parser()`) instead of the default `PairwiseStringResultOutputParser` ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the input context, which do you prefer: A or B?

Another use is for scientific observation, as in a Mssbauer spectrometer. The most common type is a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, which has been used on many space probes and on crewed lunar missions. Small fission reactors for Earth observation satellites, such as the TOPAZ nuclear reactor, have also been flown.[1] A radioisotope heater unit is powered by radioactive decay and can keep components from becoming too cold to function, potentially over a span of decades.[2] The United States tested the SNAP-10A nuclear reactor in space for 43 days in 1965,[3] with the next test of a nuclear reactor power system intended for space use occurring on 13 September 2012 with the Demonstration Using Flattop Fission (DUFF) test of the Kilopower reactor.[4] After a ground-based test of the experimental 1965 Romashka reactor, which used uranium and direct thermoelectric conversion to electricity,[5] the USSR sent about 40 nuclear-electric satellites into space, mostly powered by the BES-5 reactor. The more powerful TOPAZ-II reactor produced 10 kilowatts of electricity.[3] Examples of concepts that use nuclear power for space propulsion systems include the nuclear electric rocket (nuclear powered ion thruster(s)), the radioisotope rocket, and radioisotope electric propulsion (REP).[6] One of the more explored concepts is the nuclear thermal rocket, which was ground tested in the NERVA program. Nuclear pulse propulsion was the subject of Project Orion.[7] Regulation and hazard prevention[edit] After the ban of nuclear weapons in space by the Outer Space Treaty in 1967, nuclear power has been discussed at least since 1972 as a sensitive issue by states.[8] Particularly its potential hazards to Earth\'s environment and thus also humans has prompted states to adopt in the U.N. General Assembly the Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space (1992), particularly introducing safety principles for launches and to manage their traffic.[8] Benefits Both the Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers used RTGs for power on the surface of Mars. (Viking launch vehicle pictured) While solar power is much more commonly used, nuclear power can offer advantages in some areas. Solar cells, although efficient, can only supply energy to spacecraft in orbits where the solar flux is sufficiently high, such as low Earth orbit and interplanetary destinations close enough to the Sun. Unlike solar cells, nuclear power systems function independently of sunlight, which is necessary for deep space exploration. Nuclear-based systems can have less mass than solar cells of equivalent power, allowing more compact spacecraft that are easier to orient and direct in space. In the case of crewed spaceflight, nuclear power concepts that can power both life support and propulsion systems may reduce both cost and flight time.[9] Selected applications and/or technologies for space include: Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Radioisotope heater unit Radioisotope piezoelectric generator Radioisotope rocket Nuclear thermal rocket Nuclear pulse propulsion Nuclear electric rocket """""" docs = [ Document( page_content=split, metadata={""source"": "" ) for split in text.split() ] ``` ```python print(chain.invoke(docs)) ``` ```text Here is a summary of the key points: - Nuclear power has been used in space for electricity, heat, and scientific observation.

In an API call, you can describe functions and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. The goal of the OpenAI Function APIs is to more reliably return valid and useful function calls than a generic text completion or chat API.

Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`.

[Anthropic]( is an AI safety and research company, and is the creator of Claude. This page covers all integrations between Anthropic models and LangChain. ## Prompting Overview Claude is chat-based model, meaning it is trained on conversation data. However, it is a text based API, meaning it takes in single string. It expects this string to be in a particular format. This means that it is up the user to ensure that is the case. LangChain provides several utilities and helper functions to make sure prompts that you write - whether formatted as a string or as a list of messages - end up formatted correctly. Specifically, Claude is trained to fill in text for the Assistant role as part of an ongoing dialogue between a human user (`Human:`) and an AI assistant (`Assistant:`). Prompts sent via the API must contain `\\n\\nHuman:` and `\\n\\nAssistant:` as the signals of who\'s speaking. The final turn must always be `\\n\\nAssistant:` - the input string cannot have `\\n\\nHuman:` as the final role. Because Claude is chat-based but accepts a string as input, it can be treated as either a LangChain `ChatModel` or `LLM`. This means there are two wrappers in LangChain - `ChatAnthropic` and `Anthropic`. It is generally recommended to use the `ChatAnthropic` wrapper, and format your prompts as `ChatMessage`s (we will show examples of this below). This is because it keeps your prompt in a general format that you can easily then also use with other models (should you want to). However, if you want more fine-grained control over the prompt, you can use the `Anthropic` wrapper - we will show and example of this as well. The `Anthropic` wrapper however is deprecated, as all functionality can be achieved in a more generic way using `ChatAnthropic`. ## Prompting Best Practices Anthropic models have several prompting best practices compared to OpenAI models. **No System Messages** Anthropic models are not trained on the concept of a ""system message"". We have worked with the Anthropic team to handle them somewhat appropriately (a Human message with an `admin` tag) but this is largely a hack and it is recommended that you do not use system messages. **AI Messages Can Continue** A completion from Claude is a continuation of the last text in the string which allows you further control over Claude\'s output. For example, putting words in Claude\'s mouth in a prompt like this: `\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: What do you call a bear with no teeth?` This will return a completion like this `A gummy bear!` instead of a whole new assistant message with a different random bear joke. ## ChatAnthropic `ChatAnthropic` is a subclass of LangChain\'s `ChatModel`, meaning it works best with `ChatPromptTemplate`. You can import this wrapper with the following code: ```text from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic model = ChatAnthropic() ``` When working with ChatModels, it is preferred that you design your prompts as `ChatPromptTemplate`s. Here is an example below of doing that: ```text from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", ""You are a helpful chatbot""), (""human"", ""Tell me a joke about {topic}""), ]) ``` You can then use this in a chain as follows: ```text chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` How is the prompt actually being formatted under the hood? We can see that by running the following code ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nYou are a helpful chatbot\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that under the hood LangChain is not appending any prefix/suffix to `SystemMessage`\'s. This is because Anthropic has no concept of `SystemMessage`. Anthropic requires all prompts to end with assistant messages. This means if the last message is not an assistant message, the suffix `Assistant:` will automatically be inserted. If you decide instead to use a normal PromptTemplate (one that just works on a single string) let\'s take a look at what happens: ```text from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that it automatically adds the Human and Assistant tags. What is happening under the hood? First: the string gets converted to a single human message. This happens generically (because we are using a subclass of `ChatModel`). Then, similarly to the above example, an empty Assistant message is getting appended. This is Anthropic specific. ## [Deprecated] Anthropic This `Anthropic` wrapper is subclassed from `LLM`. We can import it with: ```text from langchain.llms import Anthropic model = Anthropic() ``` This model class is designed to work with normal PromptTemplates. An example of that is below: ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` Let\'s see what is going on with the prompt templating under the hood! ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs the following ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:\\n\' ``` Notice that it adds the Human tag at the start of the string, and then finishes it with `\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:`. The extra `Sure, here you go` was added on purpose by the Anthropic team. What happens if we have those symbols in the prompt directly? ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Human: Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\' ``` We can see that we detect that the user is trying to use the special tokens, and so we don\'t do any formatting. - [Prompting Overview](#prompting-overview) - [Prompting Best Practices](#prompting-best-practices) - [ChatAnthropic](#chatanthropic) - [Deprecated Anthropic](#deprecated-anthropic)']","To initialize `OpenAIAnthropicVectorStore`, you need to provide the necessary parameters such as the API key and possibly other configuration settings.

The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1.

Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to ""Write a story outline."" This provides a high-level structure for the task and helps in breaking it down into smaller components.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Agents can also take inputs from humans to decompose tasks. This can be done through direct communication or by leveraging human expertise. Humans can provide guidance and insights to help the agent break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals.\\n\\nOverall, task decomposition allows agents to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals, enabling them to plan and execute complex tasks efficiently.\'} ``` ```python qa(""What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'The human asks how agents use task decomposition.

Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents. This allows for easy retrieval and reference during the execution of the task.\\n\\nThese memory resources help the agent in organizing and managing information, making informed decisions, and effectively decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals.\'} ``` Again, we can use the [LangSmith trace]( to explore the prompt structure. ### Going deeper - Agents, such as the [conversational retrieval agent](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents), can be used for retrieval when necessary while also holding a conversation. - [Use case](#use-case) - [Overview](#overview) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Memory](#memory) - [Conversation](#conversation) - [Chat Retrieval](#chat-retrieval)- [Going deeper](#going-deeper)', 'Xata | Xata [Xata]( is a serverless data platform, based on `PostgreSQL` and `Elasticsearch`. It provides a Python SDK for interacting with your database, and a UI for managing your data. With the `XataChatMessageHistory` class, you can use Xata databases for longer-term persistence of chat sessions. This notebook covers: - A simple example showing what `XataChatMessageHistory` does. - A more complex example using a REACT agent that answer questions based on a knowledge based or documentation (stored in Xata as a vector store) and also having a long-term searchable history of its past messages (stored in Xata as a memory store) ## Setup ### Create a database In the [Xata UI]( create a new database. You can name it whatever you want, in this notepad we\'ll use `langchain`. The Langchain integration can auto-create the table used for storying the memory, and this is what we\'ll use in this example. If you want to pre-create the table, ensure it has the right schema and set `create_table` to `False` when creating the class. Pre-creating the table saves one round-trip to the database during each session initialization. Let\'s first install our dependencies: ```bash pip install xata openai langchain ``` Next, we need to get the environment variables for Xata. You can create a new API key by visiting your [account settings]( To find the database URL, go to the Settings page of the database that you have created. The database URL should look something like this: ` ```python import getpass api_key = getpass.getpass(""Xata API key: "") db_url = input(""Xata database URL (copy it from your DB settings):"") ``` ## Create a simple memory store To test the memory store functionality in isolation, let\'s use the following code snippet: ```python from langchain.memory import XataChatMessageHistory history = XataChatMessageHistory( session_id=""session-1"", api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""memory"" ) history.add_user_message(""hi!"") history.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` The above code creates a session with the ID `session-1` and stores two messages in it. After running the above, if you visit the Xata UI, you should see a table named `memory` and the two messages added to it. You can retrieve the message history for a particular session with the following code: ```python history.messages ``` ## Conversational Q&A chain on your data with memory Let\'s now see a more complex example in which we combine OpenAI, the Xata Vector Store integration, and the Xata memory store integration to create a Q&A chat bot on your data, with follow-up questions and history. We\'re going to need to access the OpenAI API, so let\'s configure the API key: ```python import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` To store the documents that the chatbot will search for answers, add a table named `docs` to your `langchain` database using the Xata UI, and add the following columns: - `content` of type ""Text"". This is used to store the `Document.pageContent` values. - `embedding` of type ""Vector"". Use the dimension used by the model you plan to use. In this notebook we use OpenAI embeddings, which have 1536 dimensions. Let\'s create the vector store and add some sample docs to it: ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores.xata import XataVectorStore embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() texts = [ ""Xata is a Serverless Data platform based on PostgreSQL"", ""Xata offers a built-in vector type that can be used to store and query vectors"", ""Xata includes similarity search"", ] vector_store = XataVectorStore.from_texts( texts, embeddings, api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""docs"" ) ``` After running the above command, if you go to the Xata UI, you should see the documents loaded together with their embeddings in the `docs` table. Let\'s now create a ConversationBufferMemory to store the chat messages from both the user and the AI. ```python from uuid import uuid4 from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory chat_memory = XataChatMessageHistory( session_id=str(uuid4()), # needs to be unique per user session api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""memory"", ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory( memory_key=""chat_history"", chat_memory=chat_memory, return_messages=True ) ``` Now it\'s time to create an Agent to use both the vector store and the chat memory together. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI tool = create_retriever_tool( vector_store.as_retriever(), ""search_docs"", ""Searches and returns documents from the Xata manual. Useful when you need to answer questions about Xata."", ) tools = [tool] llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` To test, let\'s tell the agent our name: ```python agent.run(input=""My name is bob"") ``` Now, let\'s now ask the agent some questions about Xata: ```python agent.run(input=""What is xata?"") ``` Notice that it answers based on the data stored in the document store. And now, let\'s ask a follow up question: ```python agent.run(input=""Does it support similarity search?"") ``` And now let\'s test its memory: ```python agent.run(input=""Did I tell you my name? What is it?"") ``` - [Setup](#setup)- [Create a database](#create-a-database) - [Create a simple memory store](#create-a-simple-memory-store) - [Conversational Q&A chain on your data with memory](#conversational-qa-chain-on-your-data-with-memory)']","To load a text file into a vector store using the XataVectorStore, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install necessary libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install xata openai langchain

2. **Import required modules**:
   ```python
   from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
   from langchain.vectorstores.xata import XataVectorStore
   from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
   ```

3. **Load and split the text**:
   ```python
   # Load your text file
   with open('your_text_file.txt', 'r') as file:
       text = file.read()

   # Split the text into chunks
   text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=100, chunk_overlap=0)
   texts = text_splitter.split_text(text)

4. **Create embeddings and load into XataVectorStore**:
   ```python
   # Initialize embeddings
   embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

   # Create the vector store
   db_url = ""your_db_url""
   api_key = ""your_api_key""
   table_name = ""your_table_name""

15,how to run a runnable,"['Dynamically route logic based on input | Dynamically route logic based on input This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language. Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`.

In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code). In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order. ## Concepts There are several key components here: ### Agent This is the chain responsible for deciding what step to take next. This is powered by a language model and a prompt. The inputs to this chain are: 1. Tools: Descriptions of available tools 2. User input: The high level objective 3. Intermediate steps: Any (action, tool output) pairs previously executed in order to achieve the user input The output is the next action(s) to take or the final response to send to the user (`AgentAction`s or `AgentFinish`). An action specifies a tool and the input to that tool. Different agents have different prompting styles for reasoning, different ways of encoding inputs, and different ways of parsing the output. For a full list of built-in agents see [agent types](/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/). You can also **easily build custom agents**, which we show how to do in the Get started section below. ### Tools Tools are functions that an agent can invoke. There are two important design considerations around tools: 1. Giving the agent access to the right tools 2. Describing the tools in a way that is most helpful to the agent Without thinking through both, you won\'t be able to build a working agent. If you don\'t give the agent access to a correct set of tools, it will never be able to accomplish the objectives you give it. If you don\'t describe the tools well, the agent won\'t know how to use them properly. LangChain provides a wide set of built-in tools, but also makes it easy to define your own (including custom descriptions). For a full list of built-in tools, see the [tools integrations section](/docs/integrations/tools/) ### Toolkits For many common tasks, an agent will need a set of related tools. For this LangChain provides the concept of toolkits - groups of around 3-5 tools needed to accomplish specific objectives. For example, the GitHub toolkit has a tool for searching through GitHub issues, a tool for reading a file, a tool for commenting, etc. LangChain provides a wide set of toolkits to get started. For a full list of built-in toolkits, see the [toolkits integrations section](/docs/integrations/toolkits/) ### AgentExecutor The agent executor is the runtime for an agent. This is what actually calls the agent, executes the actions it chooses, passes the action outputs back to the agent, and repeats. In pseudocode, this looks roughly like: ```python next_action = agent.get_action(...) while next_action != AgentFinish: observation = run(next_action) next_action = agent.get_action(..., next_action, observation) return next_action ``` While this may seem simple, there are several complexities this runtime handles for you, including: 1. Handling cases where the agent selects a non-existent tool 2. Handling cases where the tool errors 3. Handling cases where the agent produces output that cannot be parsed into a tool invocation 4. Logging and observability at all levels (agent decisions, tool calls) to stdout and/or to [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith). ### Other types of agent runtimes The `AgentExecutor` class is the main agent runtime supported by LangChain. However, there are other, more experimental runtimes we also support. These include: - [Plan-and-execute Agent](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/plan_and_execute) - [Baby AGI](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/baby_agi) - [Auto GPT](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/autogpt) You can also always create your own custom execution logic, which we show how to do below. ## Get started To best understand the agent framework, lets build an agent from scratch using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). We\'ll need to build the agent itself, define custom tools, and run the agent and tools in a custom loop. At the end we\'ll show how to use the standard LangChain `AgentExecutor` to make execution easier. Some important terminology (and schema) to know: 1. `AgentAction`: This is a dataclass that represents the action an agent should take. It has a `tool` property (which is the name of the tool that should be invoked) and a `tool_input` property (the input to that tool) 2. `AgentFinish`: This is a dataclass that signifies that the agent has finished and should return to the user. It has a `return_values` parameter, which is a dictionary to return. It often only has one key - `output` - that is a string, and so often it is just this key that is returned. 3. `intermediate_steps`: These represent previous agent actions and corresponding outputs that are passed around. These are important to pass to future iteration so the agent knows what work it has already done. This is typed as a `List[Tuple[AgentAction, Any]]`. Note that observation is currently left as type `Any` to be maximally flexible. In practice, this is often a string. ### Setup: LangSmith By definition, agents take a self-determined, input-dependent sequence of steps before returning a user-facing output. This makes debugging these systems particularly tricky, and observability particularly important. [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith) is especially useful for such cases. When building with LangChain, any built-in agent or custom agent built with LCEL will automatically be traced in LangSmith. And if we use the `AgentExecutor`, we\'ll get full tracing of not only the agent planning steps but also the tool inputs and outputs. To set up LangSmith we just need set the following environment variables: ```bash export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=""true"" export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="""" ``` ### Define the agent We first need to create our agent. This is the chain responsible for determining what action to take next. In this example, we will use OpenAI Function Calling to create this agent. **This is generally the most reliable way to create agents.** For this guide, we will construct a custom agent that has access to a custom tool. We are choosing this example because for most real world use cases you will NEED to customize either the agent or the tools. We\'ll create a simple tool that computes the length of a word. This is useful because it\'s actually something LLMs can mess up due to tokenization. We will first create it WITHOUT memory, but we will then show how to add memory in. Memory is needed to enable conversation. First, let\'s load the language model we\'re going to use to control the agent. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We can see that it struggles to count the letters in the string ""educa"". ```python llm.invoke(""how many letters in the word educa?"") ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'There are 6 letters in the word ""educa"".\') ``` Next, let\'s define some tools to use. Let\'s write a really simple Python function to calculate the length of a word that is passed in. ```python from langchain.agents import tool @tool def get_word_length(word: str) -> int: """"""Returns the length of a word."""""" return len(word) tools = [get_word_length] ``` Now let us create the prompt. Because OpenAI Function Calling is finetuned for tool usage, we hardly need any instructions on how to reason, or how to output format. We will just have two input variables: `input` and `agent_scratchpad`. `input` should be a string containing the user objective. `agent_scratchpad` should be a sequence of messages that contains the previous agent tool invocations and the corresponding tool outputs. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are very powerful assistant, but bad at calculating lengths of words."", ), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` How does the agent know what tools it can use? In this case we\'re relying on OpenAI function calling LLMs, which take functions as a separate argument and have been specifically trained to know when to invoke those functions. To pass in our tools to the agent, we just need to format them to the OpenAI function format and pass them to our model. (By `bind`-ing the functions, we\'re making sure that they\'re passed in each time the model is invoked.) ```python from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function llm_with_tools = llm.bind(functions=[format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools]) ``` Putting those pieces together, we can now create the agent. We will import two last utility functions: a component for formatting intermediate steps (agent action, tool output pairs) to input messages that can be sent to the model, and a component for converting the output message into an agent action/agent finish. ```python from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.agents.output_parsers import OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) ``` Now that we have our agent, let\'s play around with it! Let\'s pass in a simple question and empty intermediate steps and see what it returns: ```python agent.invoke({""input"": ""how many letters in the word educa?"", ""intermediate_steps"": []}) ``` ```text AgentActionMessageLog(tool=\'get_word_length\', tool_input={\'word\': \'educa\'}, log=""\\nInvoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}`\\n\\n\\n"", message_log=[AIMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={\'function_call\': {\'arguments\': \'{\\n ""word"": ""educa""\\n}\', \'name\': \'get_word_length\'}})]) ``` We can see that it responds with an `AgentAction` to take (it\'s actually an `AgentActionMessageLog` - a subclass of `AgentAction` which also tracks the full message log). If we\'ve set up LangSmith, we\'ll see a trace that let\'s us inspect the input and output to each step in the sequence: [ ### Define the runtime So this is just the first step - now we need to write a runtime for this. The simplest one is just one that continuously loops, calling the agent, then taking the action, and repeating until an `AgentFinish` is returned. Let\'s code that up below: ```python from langchain.schema.agent import AgentFinish user_input = ""how many letters in the word educa?"" intermediate_steps = [] while True: output = agent.invoke( { ""input"": user_input, ""intermediate_steps"": intermediate_steps, } ) if isinstance(output, AgentFinish): final_result = output.return_values[""output""] break else: print(f""TOOL NAME: {output.tool}"") print(f""TOOL INPUT: {output.tool_input}"") tool = {""get_word_length"": get_word_length}[output.tool] observation = tool.run(output.tool_input) intermediate_steps.append((output, observation)) print(final_result) ``` ```text TOOL NAME: get_word_length TOOL INPUT: {\'word\': \'educa\'} There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". ``` Woo! It\'s working. ### Using AgentExecutor To simplify this a bit, we can import and use the `AgentExecutor` class. This bundles up all of the above and adds in error handling, early stopping, tracing, and other quality-of-life improvements that reduce safeguards you need to write. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` Now let\'s test it out! ```python agent_executor.invoke({""input"": ""how many letters in the word educa?""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Invoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}` 5There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". > Finished chain. {\'input\': \'how many letters in the word educa?\', \'output\': \'There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"".\'} ``` And looking at the trace, we can see that all of our agent calls and tool invocations are automatically logged: [ ### Adding memory This is great - we have an agent! However, this agent is stateless - it doesn\'t remember anything about previous interactions. This means you can\'t ask follow up questions easily. Let\'s fix that by adding in memory. In order to do this, we need to do two things: 1. Add a place for memory variables to go in the prompt 2. Keep track of the chat history First, let\'s add a place for memory in the prompt. We do this by adding a placeholder for messages with the key `""chat_history""`. Notice that we put this ABOVE the new user input (to follow the conversation flow). ```python from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder MEMORY_KEY = ""chat_history"" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are very powerful assistant, but bad at calculating lengths of words."", ), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=MEMORY_KEY), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` We can then set up a list to track the chat history ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage chat_history = [] ``` We can then put it all together! ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), ""chat_history"": lambda x: x[""chat_history""], } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` When running, we now need to track the inputs and outputs as chat history ```python input1 = ""how many letters in the word educa?"" result = agent_executor.invoke({""input"": input1, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend( [ HumanMessage(content=input1), AIMessage(content=result[""output""]), ] ) agent_executor.invoke({""input"": ""is that a real word?"", ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Invoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}` 5There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". > Finished chain. > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... No, ""educa"" is not a real word in English. > Finished chain. {\'input\': \'is that a real word?\', \'chat_history\': [HumanMessage(content=\'how many letters in the word educa?\'), AIMessage(content=\'There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"".\')], \'output\': \'No, ""educa"" is not a real word in English.\'} ``` Here\'s the LangSmith trace: [ ## Next Steps Awesome!

Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`.

Therefore, as you go to move your LLM applications into production it becomes more and more important to safeguard against these. That\'s why we\'ve introduced the concept of fallbacks. A **fallback** is an alternative plan that may be used in an emergency. Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. This is important because often times different models require different prompts. So if your call to OpenAI fails, you don\'t just want to send the same prompt to Anthropic - you probably want to use a different prompt template and send a different version there. ## Fallback for LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things. Therefore, using fallbacks can help protect against these types of things. IMPORTANT: By default, a lot of the LLM wrappers catch errors and retry. You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying and not failing. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI ``` First, let\'s mock out what happens if we hit a RateLimitError from OpenAI ```python from unittest.mock import patch from openai.error import RateLimitError ``` ```python # Note that we set max_retries = 0 to avoid retrying on RateLimits, etc openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0) anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic() llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm]) ``` ```python # Let\'s use just the OpenAI LLm first, to show that we run into an error with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(openai_llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ```python # Now let\'s try with fallbacks to Anthropic with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content=\' I don\\\'t actually know why the chicken crossed the road, but here are some possible humorous answers:\\n\\n- To get to the other side!\\n\\n- It was too chicken to just stand there. \\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\n- It wanted to show the possum it could be done.\\n\\n- It was on its way to a poultry farmers\\\' convention.\\n\\nThe joke plays on the double meaning of ""the other side"" - literally crossing the road to the other side, or the ""other side"" meaning the afterlife. So it\\\'s an anti-joke, with a silly or unexpected pun as the answer.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` We can use our ""LLM with Fallbacks"" as we would a normal LLM. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content="" I don\'t actually know why the kangaroo crossed the road, but I can take a guess! Here are some possible reasons:\\n\\n- To get to the other side (the classic joke answer!)\\n\\n- It was trying to find some food or water \\n\\n- It was trying to find a mate during mating season\\n\\n- It was fleeing from a predator or perceived threat\\n\\n- It was disoriented and crossed accidentally \\n\\n- It was following a herd of other kangaroos who were crossing\\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery or environment \\n\\n- It was trying to reach a new habitat or territory\\n\\nThe real reason is unknown without more context, but hopefully one of those potential explanations does the joke justice! Let me know if you have any other animal jokes I can try to decipher."" additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback for Sequences We can also create fallbacks for sequences, that are sequences themselves. Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model). Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt. ```python # First let\'s create a chain with a ChatModel # We add in a string output parser here so the outputs between the two are the same type from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) # Here we\'re going to use a bad model name to easily create a chain that will error chat_model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"") bad_chain = chat_prompt | chat_model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python # Now lets create a chain with the normal OpenAI model from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = """"""Instructions: You should always include a compliment in your response. Question: Why did the {animal} cross the road?"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template) llm = OpenAI() good_chain = prompt | llm ``` ```python # We can now create a final chain which combines the two chain = bad_chain.with_fallbacks([good_chain]) chain.invoke({""animal"": ""turtle""}) ``` ```text \'\\n\\nAnswer: The turtle crossed the road to get to the other side, and I have to say he had some impressive determination.\' ``` ## Fallback for Long Inputs One of the big limiting factors of LLMs is their context window. Usually, you can count and track the length of prompts before sending them to an LLM, but in situations where that is hard/complicated, you can fallback to a model with a longer context length. ```python short_llm = ChatOpenAI() long_llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"") llm = short_llm.with_fallbacks([long_llm]) ``` ```python inputs = ""What is the next number: "" + "", "".join([""one"", ""two""] * 3000) ``` ```python try: print(short_llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text This model\'s maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 12012 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages. ``` ```python try: print(llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text content=\'The next number in the sequence is two.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback to Better Model Often times we ask models to output format in a specific format (like JSON). Models like GPT-3.5 can do this okay, but sometimes struggle. This naturally points to fallbacks - we can try with GPT-3.5 (faster, cheaper), but then if parsing fails we can use GPT-4. ```python from langchain.output_parsers import DatetimeOutputParser ``` ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template( ""what time was {event} (in %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ format - only return this value)"" ) ``` ```python # In this case we are going to do the fallbacks on the LLM + output parser level # Because the error will get raised in the OutputParser openai_35 = ChatOpenAI() | DatetimeOutputParser() openai_4 = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"") | DatetimeOutputParser() ``` ```python only_35 = prompt | openai_35 fallback_4 = prompt | openai_35.with_fallbacks([openai_4]) ``` ```python try: print(only_35.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text Error: Could not parse datetime string: The Super Bowl in 1994 took place on January 30th at 3:30 PM local time. Converting this to the specified format (%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ) results in: 1994-01-30T15:30:00.000Z ``` ```python try: print(fallback_4.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text 1994-01-30 15:30:00 ``` - [Fallback for LLM API Errors](#fallback-for-llm-api-errors) - [Fallback for Sequences](#fallback-for-sequences) - [Fallback for Long Inputs](#fallback-for-long-inputs) - [Fallback to Better Model](#fallback-to-better-model)']","To run gpt-4 on Anthropic, you'll need to use Anthropic's API.

You will also need an API key: you can get one for free at [ Once you have an API key, you must set it as an environment variable `KAY_API_KEY`. In this example, we\'re going to use the `KayAiRetriever`. Take a look at the [kay notebook](/docs/integrations/retrievers/kay) for more detailed information for the parameters that it accepts.` ```python # Setup API keys for Kay and OpenAI from getpass import getpass KAY_API_KEY = getpass() OPENAI_API_KEY = getpass() ``` ```text ``` ```python import os os.environ[""KAY_API_KEY""] = KAY_API_KEY os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = OPENAI_API_KEY ``` ## Example ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.retrievers import KayAiRetriever model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"") retriever = KayAiRetriever.create( dataset_id=""company"", data_types=[""10-K"", ""10-Q""], num_contexts=6 ) qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(model, retriever=retriever) ``` ```python questions = [ ""What are patterns in Nvidia\'s spend over the past three quarters?"", # ""What are some recent challenges faced by the renewable energy sector?"", ] chat_history = [] for question in questions: result = qa({""question"": question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.append((question, result[""answer""])) print(f""-> **Question**: {question} \\n"") print(f""**Answer**: {result[\'answer\']} \\n"") ``` ```text -> **Question**: What are patterns in Nvidia\'s spend over the past three quarters? **Answer**: Based on the provided information, here are the patterns in NVIDIA\'s spend over the past three quarters: 1.

It supports vector search (ANN), lexical search, and search in structured data, all in the same query. This notebook shows how to use `Vespa.ai` as a LangChain vector store. In order to create the vector store, we use [pyvespa]( to create a connection a `Vespa` service. ```python #!pip install pyvespa ``` Using the `pyvespa` package, you can either connect to a [Vespa Cloud instance]( or a local [Docker instance]( Here, we will create a new Vespa application and deploy that using Docker. #### Creating a Vespa application First, we need to create an application package: ```python from vespa.package import ApplicationPackage, Field, RankProfile app_package = ApplicationPackage(name=""testapp"") app_package.schema.add_fields( Field( name=""text"", type=""string"", indexing=[""index"", ""summary""], index=""enable-bm25"" ), Field( name=""embedding"", type=""tensor(x[384])"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""], attribute=[""distance-metric: angular""], ), ) app_package.schema.add_rank_profile( RankProfile( name=""default"", first_phase=""closeness(field, embedding)"", inputs=[(""query(query_embedding)"", ""tensor(x[384])"")], ) ) ``` This sets up a Vespa application with a schema for each document that contains two fields: `text` for holding the document text and `embedding` for holding the embedding vector. The `text` field is set up to use a BM25 index for efficient text retrieval, and we\'ll see how to use this and hybrid search a bit later. The `embedding` field is set up with a vector of length 384 to hold the embedding representation of the text. See [Vespa\'s Tensor Guide]( for more on tensors in Vespa. Lastly, we add a [rank profile]( to instruct Vespa how to order documents. Here we set this up with a [nearest neighbor search]( Now we can deploy this application locally: ```python from vespa.deployment import VespaDocker vespa_docker = VespaDocker() vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) ``` This deploys and creates a connection to a `Vespa` service. In case you already have a Vespa application running, for instance in the cloud, please refer to the PyVespa application for how to connect. #### Creating a Vespa vector store Now, let\'s load some documents: ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter loader = TextLoader(""../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) from langchain.embeddings.sentence_transformer import SentenceTransformerEmbeddings embedding_function = SentenceTransformerEmbeddings(model_name=""all-MiniLM-L6-v2"") ``` Here, we also set up local sentence embedder to transform the text to embedding vectors. One could also use OpenAI embeddings, but the vector length needs to be updated to `1536` to reflect the larger size of that embedding. To feed these to Vespa, we need to configure how the vector store should map to fields in the Vespa application. Then we create the vector store directly from this set of documents: ```python vespa_config = dict( page_content_field=""text"", embedding_field=""embedding"", input_field=""query_embedding"", ) from langchain.vectorstores import VespaStore db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) ``` This creates a Vespa vector store and feeds that set of documents to Vespa. The vector store takes care of calling the embedding function for each document and inserts them into the database. We can now query the vector store: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query) print(results[0].page_content) ``` This will use the embedding function given above to create a representation for the query and use that to search Vespa. Note that this will use the `default` ranking function, which we set up in the application package above. You can use the `ranking` argument to `similarity_search` to specify which ranking function to use. Please refer to the [pyvespa documentation]( for more information. This covers the basic usage of the Vespa store in LangChain. Now you can return the results and continue using these in LangChain. #### Updating documents An alternative to calling `from_documents`, you can create the vector store directly and call `add_texts` from that. This can also be used to update documents: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query) result = results[0] result.page_content = ""UPDATED: "" + result.page_content db.add_texts([result.page_content], [result.metadata], result.metadata[""id""]) results = db.similarity_search(query) print(results[0].page_content) ``` However, the `pyvespa` library contains methods to manipulate content on Vespa which you can use directly. #### Deleting documents You can delete documents using the `delete` function: ```python result = db.similarity_search(query) # docs[0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" db.delete([""32""]) result = db.similarity_search(query) # docs[0].metadata[""id""] != ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" ``` Again, the `pyvespa` connection contains methods to delete documents as well. ### Returning with scores The `similarity_search` method only returns the documents in order of relevancy. To retrieve the actual scores: ```python results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query) result = results[0] # result[1] ~= 0.463 ``` This is a result of using the `""all-MiniLM-L6-v2""` embedding model using the cosine distance function (as given by the argument `angular` in the application function). Different embedding functions need different distance functions, and Vespa needs to know which distance function to use when orderings documents. Please refer to the [documentation on distance functions]( for more information. ### As retriever To use this vector store as a [LangChain retriever]( simply call the `as_retriever` function, which is a standard vector store method: ```python db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) retriever = db.as_retriever() query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) # results[0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" ``` This allows for more general, unstructured, retrieval from the vector store. ### Metadata In the example so far, we\'ve only used the text and the embedding for that text. Documents usually contain additional information, which in LangChain is referred to as metadata. Vespa can contain many fields with different types by adding them to the application package: ```python app_package.schema.add_fields( # ... Field(name=""date"", type=""string"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""]), Field(name=""rating"", type=""int"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""]), Field(name=""author"", type=""string"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""]), # ... ) vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) ``` We can add some metadata fields in the documents: ```python # Add metadata for i, doc in enumerate(docs): doc.metadata[""date""] = f""2023-{(i % 12)+1}-{(i % 28)+1}"" doc.metadata[""rating""] = range(1, 6)[i % 5] doc.metadata[""author""] = [""Joe Biden"", ""Unknown""][min(i, 1)] ``` And let the Vespa vector store know about these fields: ```python vespa_config.update(dict(metadata_fields=[""date"", ""rating"", ""author""])) ``` Now, when searching for these documents, these fields will be returned. Also, these fields can be filtered on: ```python db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query, filter=""rating > 3"") # results[0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::34"" # results[0].metadata[""author""] == ""Unknown"" ``` ### Custom query If the default behavior of the similarity search does not fit your requirements, you can always provide your own query. Thus, you don\'t need to provide all of the configuration to the vector store, but rather just write this yourself. First, let\'s add a BM25 ranking function to our application: ```python from vespa.package import FieldSet app_package.schema.add_field_set(FieldSet(name=""default"", fields=[""text""])) app_package.schema.add_rank_profile(RankProfile(name=""bm25"", first_phase=""bm25(text)"")) vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) ``` Then, to perform a regular text search based on BM25: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" custom_query = { ""yql"": ""select * from sources * where userQuery()"", ""query"": query, ""type"": ""weakAnd"", ""ranking"": ""bm25"", ""hits"": 4, } results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query, custom_query=custom_query) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" # results[0][1] ~= 14.384 ``` All of the powerful search and query capabilities of Vespa can be used by using a custom query. Please refer to the Vespa documentation on it\'s [Query API]( for more details. ### Hybrid search Hybrid search means using both a classic term-based search such as BM25 and a vector search and combining the results. We need to create a new rank profile for hybrid search on Vespa: ```python app_package.schema.add_rank_profile( RankProfile( name=""hybrid"", first_phase=""log(bm25(text)) + 0.5 * closeness(field, embedding)"", inputs=[(""query(query_embedding)"", ""tensor(x[384])"")], ) ) vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) ``` Here, we score each document as a combination of it\'s BM25 score and its distance score. We can query using a custom query: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" query_embedding = embedding_function.embed_query(query) nearest_neighbor_expression = ( ""{targetHits: 4}nearestNeighbor(embedding, query_embedding)"" ) custom_query = { ""yql"": f""select * from sources * where {nearest_neighbor_expression} and userQuery()"", ""query"": query, ""type"": ""weakAnd"", ""input.query(query_embedding)"": query_embedding, ""ranking"": ""hybrid"", ""hits"": 4, } results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query, custom_query=custom_query) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""], ""id:testapp:testapp::32"") # results[0][1] ~= 2.897 ``` ### Native embedders in Vespa Up until this point we\'ve used an embedding function in Python to provide embeddings for the texts. Vespa supports embedding function natively, so you can defer this calculation in to Vespa. One benefit is the ability to use GPUs when embedding documents if you have a large collections. Please refer to [Vespa embeddings]( for more information. First, we need to modify our application package: ```python from vespa.package import Component, Parameter app_package.components = [ Component( id=""hf-embedder"", type=""hugging-face-embedder"", parameters=[ Parameter(""transformer-model"", {""path"": ""...""}), Parameter(""tokenizer-model"", {""url"": ""...""}), ], ) ] Field( name=""hfembedding"", type=""tensor(x[384])"", is_document_field=False, indexing=[""input text"", ""embed hf-embedder"", ""attribute"", ""summary""], attribute=[""distance-metric: angular""], ) app_package.schema.add_rank_profile( RankProfile( name=""hf_similarity"", first_phase=""closeness(field, hfembedding)"", inputs=[(""query(query_embedding)"", ""tensor(x[384])"")], ) ) ``` Please refer to the embeddings documentation on adding embedder models and tokenizers to the application. Note that the `hfembedding` field includes instructions for embedding using the `hf-embedder`. Now we can query with a custom query: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" nearest_neighbor_expression = ( ""{targetHits: 4}nearestNeighbor(internalembedding, query_embedding)"" ) custom_query = { ""yql"": f""select * from sources * where {nearest_neighbor_expression}"", ""input.query(query_embedding)"": f\'embed(hf-embedder, ""{query}"")\', ""ranking"": ""internal_similarity"", ""hits"": 4, } results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query, custom_query=custom_query) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""], ""id:testapp:testapp::32"") # results[0][1] ~= 0.630 ``` Note that the query here includes an `embed` instruction to embed the query using the same model as for the documents. ### Approximate nearest neighbor In all of the above examples, we\'ve used exact nearest neighbor to find results. However, for large collections of documents this is not feasible as one has to scan through all documents to find the best matches. To avoid this, we can use [approximate nearest neighbors]( First, we can change the embedding field to create a HNSW index: ```python from vespa.package import HNSW app_package.schema.add_fields( Field( name=""embedding"", type=""tensor(x[384])"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary"", ""index""], ann=HNSW( distance_metric=""angular"", max_links_per_node=16, neighbors_to_explore_at_insert=200, ), ) ) ``` This creates a HNSW index on the embedding data which allows for efficient searching. With this set, we can easily search using ANN by setting the `approximate` argument to `True`: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query, approximate=True) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""], ""id:testapp:testapp::32"") ``` This covers most of the functionality in the Vespa vector store in LangChain. - [Returning with scores](#returning-with-scores) - [As retriever](#as-retriever) - [Metadata](#metadata) - [Custom query](#custom-query) - [Hybrid search](#hybrid-search) - [Native embedders in Vespa](#native-embedders-in-vespa) - [Approximate nearest neighbor](#approximate-nearest-neighbor)']","I'm an AI system built by a team of inventors at Amazon, and I'm here to provide information and assistance.

18,What class is made when using | in langchain?,"['Router | Router Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. As a very simple example, let\'s suppose we have two templates optimized for different types of questions, and we want to choose the template based on the user input. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate physics_template = """"""You are a very smart physics professor. \\ You are great at answering questions about physics in a concise and easy to understand manner. \\ When you don\'t know the answer to a question you admit that you don\'t know.

Here is a question: {input}"""""" math_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(math_template) ``` ## Using LCEL We can easily do this using a `RunnableBranch`. A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch ``` ```python general_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question as accurately as you can.\\n\\n{input}"" ) prompt_branch = RunnableBranch( (lambda x: x[""topic""] == ""math"", math_prompt), (lambda x: x[""topic""] == ""physics"", physics_prompt), general_prompt, ) ``` ```python from typing import Literal from langchain.output_parsers.openai_functions import PydanticAttrOutputFunctionsParser from langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel from langchain.utils.openai_functions import convert_pydantic_to_openai_function class TopicClassifier(BaseModel): ""Classify the topic of the user question"" topic: Literal[""math"", ""physics"", ""general""] ""The topic of the user question.

Router chains are made up of two components: - The `RouterChain` itself (responsible for selecting the next chain to call) - `destination_chains`: chains that the router chain can route to In this example, we will focus on the different types of routing chains. We will show these routing chains used in a `MultiPromptChain` to create a question-answering chain that selects the prompt which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using that prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.chains.router import MultiPromptChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` ### [Legacy] LLMRouterChain This chain uses an LLM to determine how to route things. ```python prompt_infos = [ { ""name"": ""physics"", ""description"": ""Good for answering questions about physics"", ""prompt_template"": physics_template, }, { ""name"": ""math"", ""description"": ""Good for answering math questions"", ""prompt_template"": math_template, }, ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() ``` ```python destination_chains = {} for p_info in prompt_infos: name = p_info[""name""] prompt_template = p_info[""prompt_template""] prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=[""input""]) chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) destination_chains[name] = chain default_chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, output_key=""text"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains.router.llm_router import LLMRouterChain, RouterOutputParser from langchain.chains.router.multi_prompt_prompt import MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE ``` ```python destinations = [f""{p[\'name\']}: {p[\'description\']}"" for p in prompt_infos] destinations_str = ""\\n"".join(destinations) router_template = MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE.format(destinations=destinations_str) router_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=router_template, input_variables=[""input""], output_parser=RouterOutputParser(), ) router_chain = LLMRouterChain.from_llm(llm, router_prompt) ``` ```python chain = MultiPromptChain( router_chain=router_chain, destination_chains=destination_chains, default_chain=default_chain, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is black body radiation?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is black body radiation?\'} > Finished chain.

It is a characteristic of the temperature of the body; if the body has a uniform temperature, the radiation is also uniform across the spectrum of frequencies. The spectral characteristics of the radiation are determined by the temperature of the body, which implies that a black body at a given temperature will emit the same amount of radiation at every frequency. ``` ```python print( chain.run( ""What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?"" ) ) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( math: {\'input\': \'What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?\'} > Finished chain. The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43. This can be seen by breaking down the problem: 1) We know that a prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and one. 2) We also know that if a number is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. So, if we want to find the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3, we can start counting up from 40, testing each number to see if it is prime and if the sum of the number and one is divisible by three. The first number we come to that satisfies these conditions is 43. ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?\'} > Finished chain.

19,"in code, how can i add a system message at the end of the conversation history to influence the output of the llm","['Memory | Memory Most LLM applications have a conversational interface. An essential component of a conversation is being able to refer to information introduced earlier in the conversation. At bare minimum, a conversational system should be able to access some window of past messages directly. A more complex system will need to have a world model that it is constantly updating, which allows it to do things like maintain information about entities and their relationships. We call this ability to store information about past interactions ""memory"". LangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a system. These utilities can be used by themselves or incorporated seamlessly into a chain. A memory system needs to support two basic actions: reading and writing. Recall that every chain defines some core execution logic that expects certain inputs. Some of these inputs come directly from the user, but some of these inputs can come from memory. A chain will interact with its memory system twice in a given run. 1. AFTER receiving the initial user inputs but BEFORE executing the core logic, a chain will READ from its memory system and augment the user inputs. 2. AFTER executing the core logic but BEFORE returning the answer, a chain will WRITE the inputs and outputs of the current run to memory, so that they can be referred to in future runs. ![memory-diagram](/assets/images/memory_diagram-0627c68230aa438f9b5419064d63cbbc.png) ## Building memory into a system The two core design decisions in any memory system are: - How state is stored - How state is queried ### Storing: List of chat messages Underlying any memory is a history of all chat interactions. Even if these are not all used directly, they need to be stored in some form. One of the key parts of the LangChain memory module is a series of integrations for storing these chat messages, from in-memory lists to persistent databases. - [Chat message storage](/docs/modules/memory/chat_messages/): How to work with Chat Messages, and the various integrations offered. ### Querying: Data structures and algorithms on top of chat messages Keeping a list of chat messages is fairly straight-forward. What is less straight-forward are the data structures and algorithms built on top of chat messages that serve a view of those messages that is most useful. A very simply memory system might just return the most recent messages each run. A slightly more complex memory system might return a succinct summary of the past K messages. An even more sophisticated system might extract entities from stored messages and only return information about entities referenced in the current run. Each application can have different requirements for how memory is queried. The memory module should make it easy to both get started with simple memory systems and write your own custom systems if needed. - [Memory types](/docs/modules/memory/types/): The various data structures and algorithms that make up the memory types LangChain supports ## Get started Let\'s take a look at what Memory actually looks like in LangChain. Here we\'ll cover the basics of interacting with an arbitrary memory class. Let\'s take a look at how to use `ConversationBufferMemory` in chains. `ConversationBufferMemory` is an extremely simple form of memory that just keeps a list of chat messages in a buffer and passes those into the prompt template. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` When using memory in a chain, there are a few key concepts to understand. Note that here we cover general concepts that are useful for most types of memory. Each individual memory type may very well have its own parameters and concepts that are necessary to understand. ### What variables get returned from memory Before going into the chain, various variables are read from memory. These have specific names which need to align with the variables the chain expects. You can see what these variables are by calling `memory.load_memory_variables({})`. Note that the empty dictionary that we pass in is just a placeholder for real variables. If the memory type you are using is dependent upon the input variables, you may need to pass some in. ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': ""Human: hi!\\nAI: what\'s up?""} ``` In this case, you can see that `load_memory_variables` returns a single key, `history`. This means that your chain (and likely your prompt) should expect an input named `history`. You can usually control this variable through parameters on the memory class. For example, if you want the memory variables to be returned in the key `chat_history` you can do: ```python memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` ```text {\'chat_history\': ""Human: hi!\\nAI: what\'s up?""} ``` The parameter name to control these keys may vary per memory type, but it\'s important to understand that (1) this is controllable, and (2) how to control it. ### Whether memory is a string or a list of messages One of the most common types of memory involves returning a list of chat messages. These can either be returned as a single string, all concatenated together (useful when they will be passed into LLMs) or a list of ChatMessages (useful when passed into ChatModels). By default, they are returned as a single string. In order to return as a list of messages, you can set `return_messages=True` ```python memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True) memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` ```text {\'history\': [HumanMessage(content=\'hi!\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'what\'s up?\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]} ``` ### What keys are saved to memory Often times chains take in or return multiple input/output keys. In these cases, how can we know which keys we want to save to the chat message history? This is generally controllable by `input_key` and `output_key` parameters on the memory types. These default to `None` - and if there is only one input/output key it is known to just use that. However, if there are multiple input/output keys then you MUST specify the name of which one to use. ### End to end example Finally, let\'s take a look at using this in a chain. We\'ll use an `LLMChain`, and show working with both an LLM and a ChatModel. #### Using an LLM ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) # Notice that ""chat_history"" is present in the prompt template template = """"""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human. Previous conversation: {chat_history} New human question: {question} Response:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template) # Notice that we need to align the `memory_key` memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") conversation = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory ) ``` ```python # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` #### Using a ChatModel ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, ) from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = ChatOpenAI() prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}"") ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name. memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory ) ``` ```python # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ## Next steps And that\'s it for getting started!

In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code). In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order. ## Concepts There are several key components here: ### Agent This is the chain responsible for deciding what step to take next. This is powered by a language model and a prompt. The inputs to this chain are: 1. Tools: Descriptions of available tools 2. User input: The high level objective 3. Intermediate steps: Any (action, tool output) pairs previously executed in order to achieve the user input The output is the next action(s) to take or the final response to send to the user (`AgentAction`s or `AgentFinish`). An action specifies a tool and the input to that tool. Different agents have different prompting styles for reasoning, different ways of encoding inputs, and different ways of parsing the output. For a full list of built-in agents see [agent types](/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/). You can also **easily build custom agents**, which we show how to do in the Get started section below. ### Tools Tools are functions that an agent can invoke. There are two important design considerations around tools: 1. Giving the agent access to the right tools 2. Describing the tools in a way that is most helpful to the agent Without thinking through both, you won\'t be able to build a working agent. If you don\'t give the agent access to a correct set of tools, it will never be able to accomplish the objectives you give it. If you don\'t describe the tools well, the agent won\'t know how to use them properly. LangChain provides a wide set of built-in tools, but also makes it easy to define your own (including custom descriptions). For a full list of built-in tools, see the [tools integrations section](/docs/integrations/tools/) ### Toolkits For many common tasks, an agent will need a set of related tools. For this LangChain provides the concept of toolkits - groups of around 3-5 tools needed to accomplish specific objectives. For example, the GitHub toolkit has a tool for searching through GitHub issues, a tool for reading a file, a tool for commenting, etc. LangChain provides a wide set of toolkits to get started. For a full list of built-in toolkits, see the [toolkits integrations section](/docs/integrations/toolkits/) ### AgentExecutor The agent executor is the runtime for an agent. This is what actually calls the agent, executes the actions it chooses, passes the action outputs back to the agent, and repeats. In pseudocode, this looks roughly like: ```python next_action = agent.get_action(...) while next_action != AgentFinish: observation = run(next_action) next_action = agent.get_action(..., next_action, observation) return next_action ``` While this may seem simple, there are several complexities this runtime handles for you, including: 1. Handling cases where the agent selects a non-existent tool 2. Handling cases where the tool errors 3. Handling cases where the agent produces output that cannot be parsed into a tool invocation 4. Logging and observability at all levels (agent decisions, tool calls) to stdout and/or to [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith). ### Other types of agent runtimes The `AgentExecutor` class is the main agent runtime supported by LangChain. However, there are other, more experimental runtimes we also support. These include: - [Plan-and-execute Agent](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/plan_and_execute) - [Baby AGI](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/baby_agi) - [Auto GPT](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/autogpt) You can also always create your own custom execution logic, which we show how to do below. ## Get started To best understand the agent framework, lets build an agent from scratch using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). We\'ll need to build the agent itself, define custom tools, and run the agent and tools in a custom loop. At the end we\'ll show how to use the standard LangChain `AgentExecutor` to make execution easier. Some important terminology (and schema) to know: 1. `AgentAction`: This is a dataclass that represents the action an agent should take. It has a `tool` property (which is the name of the tool that should be invoked) and a `tool_input` property (the input to that tool) 2. `AgentFinish`: This is a dataclass that signifies that the agent has finished and should return to the user. It has a `return_values` parameter, which is a dictionary to return. It often only has one key - `output` - that is a string, and so often it is just this key that is returned. 3. `intermediate_steps`: These represent previous agent actions and corresponding outputs that are passed around. These are important to pass to future iteration so the agent knows what work it has already done. This is typed as a `List[Tuple[AgentAction, Any]]`. Note that observation is currently left as type `Any` to be maximally flexible. In practice, this is often a string. ### Setup: LangSmith By definition, agents take a self-determined, input-dependent sequence of steps before returning a user-facing output. This makes debugging these systems particularly tricky, and observability particularly important. [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith) is especially useful for such cases. When building with LangChain, any built-in agent or custom agent built with LCEL will automatically be traced in LangSmith. And if we use the `AgentExecutor`, we\'ll get full tracing of not only the agent planning steps but also the tool inputs and outputs. To set up LangSmith we just need set the following environment variables: ```bash export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=""true"" export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="""" ``` ### Define the agent We first need to create our agent. This is the chain responsible for determining what action to take next. In this example, we will use OpenAI Function Calling to create this agent. **This is generally the most reliable way to create agents.** For this guide, we will construct a custom agent that has access to a custom tool. We are choosing this example because for most real world use cases you will NEED to customize either the agent or the tools. We\'ll create a simple tool that computes the length of a word. This is useful because it\'s actually something LLMs can mess up due to tokenization. We will first create it WITHOUT memory, but we will then show how to add memory in. Memory is needed to enable conversation. First, let\'s load the language model we\'re going to use to control the agent. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We can see that it struggles to count the letters in the string ""educa"". ```python llm.invoke(""how many letters in the word educa?"") ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'There are 6 letters in the word ""educa"".\') ``` Next, let\'s define some tools to use. Let\'s write a really simple Python function to calculate the length of a word that is passed in. ```python from langchain.agents import tool @tool def get_word_length(word: str) -> int: """"""Returns the length of a word."""""" return len(word) tools = [get_word_length] ``` Now let us create the prompt. Because OpenAI Function Calling is finetuned for tool usage, we hardly need any instructions on how to reason, or how to output format. We will just have two input variables: `input` and `agent_scratchpad`. `input` should be a string containing the user objective. `agent_scratchpad` should be a sequence of messages that contains the previous agent tool invocations and the corresponding tool outputs. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are very powerful assistant, but bad at calculating lengths of words."", ), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` How does the agent know what tools it can use? In this case we\'re relying on OpenAI function calling LLMs, which take functions as a separate argument and have been specifically trained to know when to invoke those functions. To pass in our tools to the agent, we just need to format them to the OpenAI function format and pass them to our model. (By `bind`-ing the functions, we\'re making sure that they\'re passed in each time the model is invoked.) ```python from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function llm_with_tools = llm.bind(functions=[format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools]) ``` Putting those pieces together, we can now create the agent. We will import two last utility functions: a component for formatting intermediate steps (agent action, tool output pairs) to input messages that can be sent to the model, and a component for converting the output message into an agent action/agent finish. ```python from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.agents.output_parsers import OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) ``` Now that we have our agent, let\'s play around with it! Let\'s pass in a simple question and empty intermediate steps and see what it returns: ```python agent.invoke({""input"": ""how many letters in the word educa?"", ""intermediate_steps"": []}) ``` ```text AgentActionMessageLog(tool=\'get_word_length\', tool_input={\'word\': \'educa\'}, log=""\\nInvoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}`\\n\\n\\n"", message_log=[AIMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={\'function_call\': {\'arguments\': \'{\\n ""word"": ""educa""\\n}\', \'name\': \'get_word_length\'}})]) ``` We can see that it responds with an `AgentAction` to take (it\'s actually an `AgentActionMessageLog` - a subclass of `AgentAction` which also tracks the full message log). If we\'ve set up LangSmith, we\'ll see a trace that let\'s us inspect the input and output to each step in the sequence: [ ### Define the runtime So this is just the first step - now we need to write a runtime for this. The simplest one is just one that continuously loops, calling the agent, then taking the action, and repeating until an `AgentFinish` is returned. Let\'s code that up below: ```python from langchain.schema.agent import AgentFinish user_input = ""how many letters in the word educa?"" intermediate_steps = [] while True: output = agent.invoke( { ""input"": user_input, ""intermediate_steps"": intermediate_steps, } ) if isinstance(output, AgentFinish): final_result = output.return_values[""output""] break else: print(f""TOOL NAME: {output.tool}"") print(f""TOOL INPUT: {output.tool_input}"") tool = {""get_word_length"": get_word_length}[output.tool] observation = tool.run(output.tool_input) intermediate_steps.append((output, observation)) print(final_result) ``` ```text TOOL NAME: get_word_length TOOL INPUT: {\'word\': \'educa\'} There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". ``` Woo! It\'s working. ### Using AgentExecutor To simplify this a bit, we can import and use the `AgentExecutor` class. This bundles up all of the above and adds in error handling, early stopping, tracing, and other quality-of-life improvements that reduce safeguards you need to write. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` Now let\'s test it out! ```python agent_executor.invoke({""input"": ""how many letters in the word educa?""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Invoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}` 5There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". > Finished chain. {\'input\': \'how many letters in the word educa?\', \'output\': \'There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"".\'} ``` And looking at the trace, we can see that all of our agent calls and tool invocations are automatically logged: [ ### Adding memory This is great - we have an agent! However, this agent is stateless - it doesn\'t remember anything about previous interactions. This means you can\'t ask follow up questions easily. Let\'s fix that by adding in memory. In order to do this, we need to do two things: 1. Add a place for memory variables to go in the prompt 2. Keep track of the chat history First, let\'s add a place for memory in the prompt. We do this by adding a placeholder for messages with the key `""chat_history""`. Notice that we put this ABOVE the new user input (to follow the conversation flow). ```python from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder MEMORY_KEY = ""chat_history"" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are very powerful assistant, but bad at calculating lengths of words."", ), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=MEMORY_KEY), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` We can then set up a list to track the chat history ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage chat_history = [] ``` We can then put it all together! ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), ""chat_history"": lambda x: x[""chat_history""], } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` When running, we now need to track the inputs and outputs as chat history ```python input1 = ""how many letters in the word educa?"" result = agent_executor.invoke({""input"": input1, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend( [ HumanMessage(content=input1), AIMessage(content=result[""output""]), ] ) agent_executor.invoke({""input"": ""is that a real word?"", ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Invoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}` 5There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". > Finished chain. > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... No, ""educa"" is not a real word in English. > Finished chain. {\'input\': \'is that a real word?\', \'chat_history\': [HumanMessage(content=\'how many letters in the word educa?\'), AIMessage(content=\'There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"".\')], \'output\': \'No, ""educa"" is not a real word in English.\'} ``` Here\'s the LangSmith trace: [ ## Next Steps Awesome!

This type of memory creates a summary of the conversation over time. This can be useful for condensing information from the conversation over time. Conversation summary memory summarizes the conversation as it happens and stores the current summary in memory. This memory can then be used to inject the summary of the conversation so far into a prompt/chain. This memory is most useful for longer conversations, where keeping the past message history in the prompt verbatim would take up too many tokens. Let\'s first explore the basic functionality of this type of memory. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory, ChatMessageHistory from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0)) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.\'} ``` We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model). ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), return_messages=True) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.\', additional_kwargs={})]} ``` We can also utilize the `predict_new_summary` method directly. ```python messages = memory.chat_memory.messages previous_summary = """" memory.predict_new_summary(messages, previous_summary) ``` ```text \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.\' ``` ## Initializing with messages/existing summary If you have messages outside this class, you can easily initialize the class with `ChatMessageHistory`. During loading, a summary will be calculated. ```python history = ChatMessageHistory() history.add_user_message(""hi"") history.add_ai_message(""hi there!"") ``` ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory.from_messages( llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), chat_memory=history, return_messages=True ) ``` ```python memory.buffer ``` ```text \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds with a friendly greeting.\' ``` Optionally you can speed up initialization using a previously generated summary, and avoid regenerating the summary by just initializing directly. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), buffer=""The human asks what the AI thinks of artificial intelligence. The AI thinks artificial intelligence is a force for good because it will help humans reach their full potential."", chat_memory=history, return_messages=True ) ``` ## Using in a chain Let\'s walk through an example of using this in a chain, again setting `verbose=True` so we can see the prompt. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.chains import ConversationChain llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain( llm=llm, memory=ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI()), verbose=True ) conversation_with_summary.predict(input=""Hi, what\'s up?"") ``` ```text > Entering new ConversationChain chain...

Here's an example:

from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

# Initialize chat history
chat_history = ChatMessageHistory()

# Add user and AI messages to the history
chat_history.add_user_message(""Hi, how are you?"")
chat_history.add_ai_message(""I'm doing well, thank you!"")

# Create a system message to influence the output
system_message = ""Remind the AI to be more helpful and informative.""

# Append the system message to the chat history
chat_history.append_messages(system_message=system_message)

# Initialize the LLM and the conversation chain
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation_with_history = ConversationChain(llm=llm, memory=chat_history, verbose=True)

# Continue the conversation
response = conversation_with_history.predict(input=""What can you tell me about AI?"")
print(response)

In this example, the `append_messages` method is used to add the system message to the end of the conversation history. This message will be included in the context when the LLM generates its response, potentially influencing the output to be more helpful and informative.","

20,how to use enums in Tools that will be used by functions agent?,"['Agents | Agents The core idea of agents is to use a language model to choose a sequence of actions to take. In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code). In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order. ## Concepts There are several key components here: ### Agent This is the chain responsible for deciding what step to take next. This is powered by a language model and a prompt. The inputs to this chain are: 1. Tools: Descriptions of available tools 2. User input: The high level objective 3. Intermediate steps: Any (action, tool output) pairs previously executed in order to achieve the user input The output is the next action(s) to take or the final response to send to the user (`AgentAction`s or `AgentFinish`). An action specifies a tool and the input to that tool. Different agents have different prompting styles for reasoning, different ways of encoding inputs, and different ways of parsing the output. For a full list of built-in agents see [agent types](/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/). You can also **easily build custom agents**, which we show how to do in the Get started section below. ### Tools Tools are functions that an agent can invoke. There are two important design considerations around tools: 1. Giving the agent access to the right tools 2. Describing the tools in a way that is most helpful to the agent Without thinking through both, you won\'t be able to build a working agent. If you don\'t give the agent access to a correct set of tools, it will never be able to accomplish the objectives you give it. If you don\'t describe the tools well, the agent won\'t know how to use them properly. LangChain provides a wide set of built-in tools, but also makes it easy to define your own (including custom descriptions). For a full list of built-in tools, see the [tools integrations section](/docs/integrations/tools/) ### Toolkits For many common tasks, an agent will need a set of related tools. For this LangChain provides the concept of toolkits - groups of around 3-5 tools needed to accomplish specific objectives. For example, the GitHub toolkit has a tool for searching through GitHub issues, a tool for reading a file, a tool for commenting, etc. LangChain provides a wide set of toolkits to get started. For a full list of built-in toolkits, see the [toolkits integrations section](/docs/integrations/toolkits/) ### AgentExecutor The agent executor is the runtime for an agent. This is what actually calls the agent, executes the actions it chooses, passes the action outputs back to the agent, and repeats. In pseudocode, this looks roughly like: ```python next_action = agent.get_action(...) while next_action != AgentFinish: observation = run(next_action) next_action = agent.get_action(..., next_action, observation) return next_action ``` While this may seem simple, there are several complexities this runtime handles for you, including: 1. Handling cases where the agent selects a non-existent tool 2. Handling cases where the tool errors 3. Handling cases where the agent produces output that cannot be parsed into a tool invocation 4. Logging and observability at all levels (agent decisions, tool calls) to stdout and/or to [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith). ### Other types of agent runtimes The `AgentExecutor` class is the main agent runtime supported by LangChain. However, there are other, more experimental runtimes we also support. These include: - [Plan-and-execute Agent](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/plan_and_execute) - [Baby AGI](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/baby_agi) - [Auto GPT](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/autogpt) You can also always create your own custom execution logic, which we show how to do below. ## Get started To best understand the agent framework, lets build an agent from scratch using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). We\'ll need to build the agent itself, define custom tools, and run the agent and tools in a custom loop. At the end we\'ll show how to use the standard LangChain `AgentExecutor` to make execution easier. Some important terminology (and schema) to know: 1. `AgentAction`: This is a dataclass that represents the action an agent should take. It has a `tool` property (which is the name of the tool that should be invoked) and a `tool_input` property (the input to that tool) 2. `AgentFinish`: This is a dataclass that signifies that the agent has finished and should return to the user. It has a `return_values` parameter, which is a dictionary to return. It often only has one key - `output` - that is a string, and so often it is just this key that is returned. 3. `intermediate_steps`: These represent previous agent actions and corresponding outputs that are passed around. These are important to pass to future iteration so the agent knows what work it has already done. This is typed as a `List[Tuple[AgentAction, Any]]`. Note that observation is currently left as type `Any` to be maximally flexible. In practice, this is often a string. ### Setup: LangSmith By definition, agents take a self-determined, input-dependent sequence of steps before returning a user-facing output.

And if we use the `AgentExecutor`, we\'ll get full tracing of not only the agent planning steps but also the tool inputs and outputs.

Notice that we put this ABOVE the new user input (to follow the conversation flow). ```python from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder MEMORY_KEY = ""chat_history"" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are very powerful assistant, but bad at calculating lengths of words."", ), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=MEMORY_KEY), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` We can then set up a list to track the chat history ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage chat_history = [] ``` We can then put it all together! ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), ""chat_history"": lambda x: x[""chat_history""], } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` When running, we now need to track the inputs and outputs as chat history ```python input1 = ""how many letters in the word educa?"" result = agent_executor.invoke({""input"": input1, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend( [ HumanMessage(content=input1), AIMessage(content=result[""output""]), ] ) agent_executor.invoke({""input"": ""is that a real word?"", ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Besides the actual function that is called, the Tool consists of several components: - `name` (str), is required and must be unique within a set of tools provided to an agent - `description` (str), is optional but recommended, as it is used by an agent to determine tool use - `return_direct` (bool), defaults to False - `args_schema` (Pydantic BaseModel), is optional but recommended, can be used to provide more information (e.g., few-shot examples) or validation for expected parameters. There are two main ways to define a tool, we will cover both in the example below. ```python # Import things that are needed generically from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.chains import LLMMathChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import BaseTool, StructuredTool, Tool, tool from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper ``` Initialize the LLM to use for the agent. ```python llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ## Completely New Tools - String Input and Output The simplest tools accept a single query string and return a string output. If your tool function requires multiple arguments, you might want to skip down to the `StructuredTool` section below. There are two ways to do this: either by using the Tool dataclass, or by subclassing the BaseTool class. ### Tool dataclass The \'Tool\' dataclass wraps functions that accept a single string input and returns a string output. ```python # Load the tool configs that are needed. search = SerpAPIWrapper() llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True) tools = [ Tool.from_function( func=search.run, name=""Search"", description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", # coroutine= ... <- you can specify an async method if desired as well ), ] ``` ```text /Users/wfh/code/lc/lckg/langchain/chains/llm_math/base.py:50: UserWarning: Directly instantiating an LLMMathChain with an llm is deprecated. Please instantiate with llm_chain argument or using the from_llm class method. warnings.warn( ``` You can also define a custom `args_schema` to provide more information about inputs. ```python from pydantic import BaseModel, Field class CalculatorInput(BaseModel): question: str = Field() tools.append( Tool.from_function( func=llm_math_chain.run, name=""Calculator"", description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"", args_schema=CalculatorInput, # coroutine= ... <- you can specify an async method if desired as well ) ) ``` ```python # Construct the agent. We will use the default agent type here. # See documentation for a full list of options. agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?

This is useful if you want more control over the instance variables or if you want to propagate callbacks to nested chains or other tools. ```python from typing import Optional, Type from langchain.callbacks.manager import ( AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun, CallbackManagerForToolRun, ) class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool): name = ""custom_search"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" def _run( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" return search.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"") class CustomCalculatorTool(BaseTool): name = ""Calculator"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"" args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = CalculatorInput def _run( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" return llm_math_chain.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""Calculator does not support async"") ``` ```python tools = [CustomSearchTool(), CustomCalculatorTool()] agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?

This decorator can be used to quickly create a `Tool` from a simple function. The decorator uses the function name as the tool name by default, but this can be overridden by passing a string as the first argument. Additionally, the decorator will use the function\'s docstring as the tool\'s description. ```python from langchain.tools import tool @tool def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return f""Results for query {query}"" search_api ``` You can also provide arguments like the tool name and whether to return directly. ```python @tool(""search"", return_direct=True) def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return ""Results"" ``` ```python search_api ``` ```text Tool(name=\'search\', description=\'search(query: str) -> str - Searches the API for the query.\', args_schema=, return_direct=True, verbose=False, callback_manager=, func=, coroutine=None) ``` You can also provide `args_schema` to provide more information about the argument. ```python class SearchInput(BaseModel): query: str = Field(description=""should be a search query"") @tool(""search"", return_direct=True, args_schema=SearchInput) def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return ""Results"" ``` ```python search_api ``` ```text Tool(name=\'search\', description=\'search(query: str) -> str - Searches the API for the query.\', args_schema=, return_direct=True, verbose=False, callback_manager=, func=, coroutine=None) ``` ## Custom Structured Tools If your functions require more structured arguments, you can use the `StructuredTool` class directly, or still subclass the `BaseTool` class. ### StructuredTool dataclass To dynamically generate a structured tool from a given function, the fastest way to get started is with `StructuredTool.from_function()`. ```python import requests from langchain.tools import StructuredTool def post_message(url: str, body: dict, parameters: Optional[dict] = None) -> str: """"""Sends a POST request to the given url with the given body and parameters."""""" result = requests.post(url, json=body, params=parameters) return f""Status: {result.status_code} - {result.text}"" tool = StructuredTool.from_function(post_message) ``` ### Subclassing the BaseTool The BaseTool automatically infers the schema from the `_run` method\'s signature. ```python from typing import Optional, Type from langchain.callbacks.manager import ( AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun, CallbackManagerForToolRun, ) class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool): name = ""custom_search"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" def _run( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" search_wrapper = SerpAPIWrapper(params={""engine"": engine, ""gl"": gl, ""hl"": hl}) return search_wrapper.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"") # You can provide a custom args schema to add descriptions or custom validation class SearchSchema(BaseModel): query: str = Field(description=""should be a search query"") engine: str = Field(description=""should be a search engine"") gl: str = Field(description=""should be a country code"") hl: str = Field(description=""should be a language code"") class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool): name = ""custom_search"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" args_schema: Type[SearchSchema] = SearchSchema def _run( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" search_wrapper = SerpAPIWrapper(params={""engine"": engine, ""gl"": gl, ""hl"": hl}) return search_wrapper.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"") ``` ### Using the decorator The `tool` decorator creates a structured tool automatically if the signature has multiple arguments. ```python import requests from langchain.tools import tool @tool def post_message(url: str, body: dict, parameters: Optional[dict] = None) -> str: """"""Sends a POST request to the given url with the given body and parameters."""""" result = requests.post(url, json=body, params=parameters) return f""Status: {result.status_code} - {result.text}"" ``` ## Modify existing tools Now, we show how to load existing tools and modify them directly. In the example below, we do something really simple and change the Search tool to have the name `Google Search`. ```python from langchain.agents import load_tools ``` ```python tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm) ``` ```python tools[0].name = ""Google Search"" ``` ```python agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?

""The age of Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend raised to the 0.43 power is approximately 3.55."" ``` ## Defining the priorities among Tools When you made a Custom tool, you may want the Agent to use the custom tool more than normal tools. For example, you made a custom tool, which gets information on music from your database. When a user wants information on songs, You want the Agent to use `the custom tool` more than the normal `Search tool`. But the Agent might prioritize a normal Search tool. This can be accomplished by adding a statement such as `Use this more than the normal search if the question is about Music, like \'who is the singer of yesterday?\' or \'what is the most popular song in 2022?\'` to the description. An example is below. ```python # Import things that are needed generically from langchain.agents import AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent from langchain.chains import LLMMathChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper search = SerpAPIWrapper() tools = [ Tool( name=""Search"", func=search.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", ), Tool( name=""Music Search"", func=lambda x: ""\'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey."", # Mock Function description=""A Music search engine. Use this more than the normal search if the question is about Music, like \'who is the singer of yesterday?\' or \'what is the most popular song in 2022?\'"", ), ] agent = initialize_agent( tools, OpenAI(temperature=0), agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python agent.run(""what is the most famous song of christmas"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I should use a music search engine to find the answer Action: Music Search Action Input: most famous song of christmas\'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey. I now know the final answer Final Answer: \'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey. > Finished chain. ""\'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey."" ``` ## Using tools to return directly Often, it can be desirable to have a tool output returned directly to the user, if it\'s called. You can do this easily with LangChain by setting the `return_direct` flag for a tool to be True. ```python llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm) tools = [ Tool( name=""Calculator"", func=llm_math_chain.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"", return_direct=True, ) ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run(""whats 2**.12"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I need to calculate this Action: Calculator Action Input: 2**.12Answer: 1.086734862526058 > Finished chain. \'Answer: 1.086734862526058\' ``` ## Handling Tool Errors When a tool encounters an error and the exception is not caught, the agent will stop executing. If you want the agent to continue execution, you can raise a `ToolException` and set `handle_tool_error` accordingly. When `ToolException` is thrown, the agent will not stop working, but will handle the exception according to the `handle_tool_error` variable of the tool, and the processing result will be returned to the agent as observation, and printed in red. You can set `handle_tool_error` to `True`, set it a unified string value, or set it as a function. If it\'s set as a function, the function should take a `ToolException` as a parameter and return a `str` value. Please note that only raising a `ToolException` won\'t be effective. You need to first set the `handle_tool_error` of the tool because its default value is `False`. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import Tool from langchain.tools.base import ToolException from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper def _handle_error(error: ToolException) -> str: return ( ""The following errors occurred during tool execution:"" + error.args[0] + ""Please try another tool."" ) def search_tool1(s: str): raise ToolException(""The search tool1 is not available."") def search_tool2(s: str): raise ToolException(""The search tool2 is not available."") search_tool3 = SerpAPIWrapper() ``` ```python description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events.You should give priority to using it."" tools = [ Tool.from_function( func=search_tool1, name=""Search_tool1"", description=description, handle_tool_error=True, ), Tool.from_function( func=search_tool2, name=""Search_tool2"", description=description, handle_tool_error=_handle_error, ), Tool.from_function( func=search_tool3.run, name=""Search_tool3"", description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", ), ] agent = initialize_agent( tools, ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python agent.run(""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

21,How do I deal with openai rate limiting by having a backup model? Show me with code.,"['Fallbacks | Fallbacks When working with language models, you may often encounter issues from the underlying APIs, whether these be rate limiting or downtime. Therefore, as you go to move your LLM applications into production it becomes more and more important to safeguard against these. That\'s why we\'ve introduced the concept of fallbacks. A **fallback** is an alternative plan that may be used in an emergency. Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. This is important because often times different models require different prompts. So if your call to OpenAI fails, you don\'t just want to send the same prompt to Anthropic - you probably want to use a different prompt template and send a different version there. ## Fallback for LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things. Therefore, using fallbacks can help protect against these types of things. IMPORTANT: By default, a lot of the LLM wrappers catch errors and retry. You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying and not failing. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI ``` First, let\'s mock out what happens if we hit a RateLimitError from OpenAI ```python from unittest.mock import patch from openai.error import RateLimitError ``` ```python # Note that we set max_retries = 0 to avoid retrying on RateLimits, etc openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0) anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic() llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm]) ``` ```python # Let\'s use just the OpenAI LLm first, to show that we run into an error with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(openai_llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ```python # Now let\'s try with fallbacks to Anthropic with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content=\' I don\\\'t actually know why the chicken crossed the road, but here are some possible humorous answers:\\n\\n- To get to the other side!\\n\\n- It was too chicken to just stand there. \\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\n- It wanted to show the possum it could be done.\\n\\n- It was on its way to a poultry farmers\\\' convention.\\n\\nThe joke plays on the double meaning of ""the other side"" - literally crossing the road to the other side, or the ""other side"" meaning the afterlife. So it\\\'s an anti-joke, with a silly or unexpected pun as the answer.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` We can use our ""LLM with Fallbacks"" as we would a normal LLM. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content="" I don\'t actually know why the kangaroo crossed the road, but I can take a guess! Here are some possible reasons:\\n\\n- To get to the other side (the classic joke answer!)\\n\\n- It was trying to find some food or water \\n\\n- It was trying to find a mate during mating season\\n\\n- It was fleeing from a predator or perceived threat\\n\\n- It was disoriented and crossed accidentally \\n\\n- It was following a herd of other kangaroos who were crossing\\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery or environment \\n\\n- It was trying to reach a new habitat or territory\\n\\nThe real reason is unknown without more context, but hopefully one of those potential explanations does the joke justice! Let me know if you have any other animal jokes I can try to decipher."" additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback for Sequences We can also create fallbacks for sequences, that are sequences themselves. Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model). Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt. ```python # First let\'s create a chain with a ChatModel # We add in a string output parser here so the outputs between the two are the same type from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) # Here we\'re going to use a bad model name to easily create a chain that will error chat_model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"") bad_chain = chat_prompt | chat_model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python # Now lets create a chain with the normal OpenAI model from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = """"""Instructions: You should always include a compliment in your response. Question: Why did the {animal} cross the road?"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template) llm = OpenAI() good_chain = prompt | llm ``` ```python # We can now create a final chain which combines the two chain = bad_chain.with_fallbacks([good_chain]) chain.invoke({""animal"": ""turtle""}) ``` ```text \'\\n\\nAnswer: The turtle crossed the road to get to the other side, and I have to say he had some impressive determination.\' ``` ## Fallback for Long Inputs One of the big limiting factors of LLMs is their context window. Usually, you can count and track the length of prompts before sending them to an LLM, but in situations where that is hard/complicated, you can fallback to a model with a longer context length. ```python short_llm = ChatOpenAI() long_llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"") llm = short_llm.with_fallbacks([long_llm]) ``` ```python inputs = ""What is the next number: "" + "", "".join([""one"", ""two""] * 3000) ``` ```python try: print(short_llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text This model\'s maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 12012 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages. ``` ```python try: print(llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text content=\'The next number in the sequence is two.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback to Better Model Often times we ask models to output format in a specific format (like JSON). Models like GPT-3.5 can do this okay, but sometimes struggle. This naturally points to fallbacks - we can try with GPT-3.5 (faster, cheaper), but then if parsing fails we can use GPT-4. ```python from langchain.output_parsers import DatetimeOutputParser ``` ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template( ""what time was {event} (in %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ format - only return this value)"" ) ``` ```python # In this case we are going to do the fallbacks on the LLM + output parser level # Because the error will get raised in the OutputParser openai_35 = ChatOpenAI() | DatetimeOutputParser() openai_4 = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"") | DatetimeOutputParser() ``` ```python only_35 = prompt | openai_35 fallback_4 = prompt | openai_35.with_fallbacks([openai_4]) ``` ```python try: print(only_35.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text Error: Could not parse datetime string: The Super Bowl in 1994 took place on January 30th at 3:30 PM local time. Converting this to the specified format (%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ) results in: 1994-01-30T15:30:00.000Z ``` ```python try: print(fallback_4.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text 1994-01-30 15:30:00 ``` - [Fallback for LLM API Errors](#fallback-for-llm-api-errors) - [Fallback for Sequences](#fallback-for-sequences) - [Fallback for Long Inputs](#fallback-for-long-inputs) - [Fallback to Better Model](#fallback-to-better-model)', 'Metaphor Search | Metaphor Search Metaphor is a search engine fully designed to be used by LLMs. You can search and then get the contents for any page.

Here's a simple example using Python:

```python
from openai import RateLimitError
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI, ChatAnthropic

# Initialize the primary model
openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0)  # Set max_retries to 0 to disable retries

# Initialize the fallback model
anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic()

# Combine the primary and fallback models
llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm])

# Example function to invoke the LLM
def invoke_llm(prompt):
    try:
        response = llm.invoke(prompt)
        print(""Response from primary model or fallback:"")
        print(response)
    except RateLimitError:
        print(""Rate limit exceeded, falling back to the fallback model."")

# Example usage
invoke_llm(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")
```

In this example:
- `ChatOpenAI` is set up as the primary model with `max_retries=0` to avoid automatic retries.
- `ChatAnthropic` is used as the fallback model.
- The `with_fallbacks` method combines the two models, allowing the application to fall back to the fallback model in case of a `RateLimitError`.

This setup ensures that if the primary model hits a rate limit, the application will automatically try the fallback model.","A straightforward way to do this is to specify fallback models using LangChain Expression Language. Example below:
```python     
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

bad_llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"")
good_llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"")

22,I'm runing my own model using vllm. How do I connect it to LangChain?,"['Memory in LLMChain | Memory in LLMChain This notebook goes over how to use the Memory class with an `LLMChain`. We will add the [ConversationBufferMemory]( class, although this can be any memory class. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` The most important step is setting up the prompt correctly. In the below prompt, we have two input keys: one for the actual input, another for the input from the Memory class. Importantly, we make sure the keys in the `PromptTemplate` and the `ConversationBufferMemory` match up (`chat_history`). ```python template = """"""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. {chat_history} Human: {human_input} Chatbot:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""chat_history"", ""human_input""], template=template ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend Chatbot: > Finished chain. \' Hi there!

How are you doing?"" ``` ## Adding Memory to a chat model-based LLMChain The above works for completion-style `LLM`s, but if you are using a chat model, you will likely get better performance using structured chat messages. Below is an example. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, ) from langchain.schema import SystemMessage ``` We will use the [ChatPromptTemplate]( class to set up the chat prompt. The [from_messages]( method creates a `ChatPromptTemplate` from a list of messages (e.g., `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ChatMessage`, etc.) or message templates, such as the [MessagesPlaceholder]( below. The configuration below makes it so the memory will be injected to the middle of the chat prompt, in the `chat_history` key, and the user\'s inputs will be added in a human/user message to the end of the chat prompt. ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The persistent system prompt MessagesPlaceholder( variable_name=""chat_history"" ), # Where the memory will be stored. HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""{human_input}"" ), # Where the human input will injected ] ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI() chat_llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

23,What's a runnable lambda?,"['LangSmith Walkthrough | LangSmith Walkthrough []( LangChain makes it easy to prototype LLM applications and Agents. However, delivering LLM applications to production can be deceptively difficult. You will likely have to heavily customize and iterate on your prompts, chains, and other components to create a high-quality product. To aid in this process, we\'ve launched LangSmith, a unified platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring your LLM applications. When might this come in handy? You may find it useful when you want to: - Quickly debug a new chain, agent, or set of tools - Visualize how components (chains, llms, retrievers, etc.) relate and are used - Evaluate different prompts and LLMs for a single component - Run a given chain several times over a dataset to ensure it consistently meets a quality bar - Capture usage traces and using LLMs or analytics pipelines to generate insights ## Prerequisites **Create a LangSmith account and create an API key (see bottom left corner). Familiarize yourself with the platform by looking through the docs** Note LangSmith is in closed beta; we\'re in the process of rolling it out to more users. However, you can fill out the form on the website for expedited access. Now, let\'s get started! ## Log runs to LangSmith First, configure your environment variables to tell LangChain to log traces. This is done by setting the `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2` environment variable to true. You can tell LangChain which project to log to by setting the `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT` environment variable (if this isn\'t set, runs will be logged to the `default` project). This will automatically create the project for you if it doesn\'t exist. You must also set the `LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT` and `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` environment variables. For more information on other ways to set up tracing, please reference the [LangSmith documentation]( **NOTE:** You must also set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables in order to run the following tutorial. **NOTE:** You can only access an API key when you first create it. Keep it somewhere safe. **NOTE:** You can also use a context manager in python to log traces using ```python from langchain.callbacks.manager import tracing_v2_enabled with tracing_v2_enabled(project_name=""My Project""): agent.run(""How many people live in canada as of 2023?"") ``` However, in this example, we will use environment variables. ```python %pip install openai tiktoken pandas duckduckgo-search --quiet ``` ```python import os from uuid import uuid4 unique_id = uuid4().hex[0:8] os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_PROJECT""] = f""Tracing Walkthrough - {unique_id}"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT""] = "" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = """" # Update to your API key # Used by the agent in this tutorial os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """" ``` Create the langsmith client to interact with the API ```python from langsmith import Client client = Client() ``` Create a LangChain component and log runs to the platform. In this example, we will create a ReAct-style agent with access to a general search tool (DuckDuckGo). The agent\'s prompt can be viewed in the [Hub here]( ```python from langchain import hub from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.agents.output_parsers import OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchResults from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function # Fetches the latest version of this prompt prompt = hub.pull(""wfh/langsmith-agent-prompt:latest"") llm = ChatOpenAI( model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"", temperature=0, ) tools = [ DuckDuckGoSearchResults( name=""duck_duck_go"" ), # General internet search using DuckDuckGo ] llm_with_tools = llm.bind(functions=[format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools]) runnable_agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) agent_executor = AgentExecutor( agent=runnable_agent, tools=tools, handle_parsing_errors=True ) ``` We are running the agent concurrently on multiple inputs to reduce latency. Runs get logged to LangSmith in the background so execution latency is unaffected. ```python inputs = [ ""What is LangChain?"", ""What\'s LangSmith?"", ""When was Llama-v2 released?"", ""What is the langsmith cookbook?"", ""When did langchain first announce the hub?"", ] results = agent_executor.batch([{""input"": x} for x in inputs], return_exceptions=True) ``` ```python results[:2] ``` ```text [{\'input\': \'What is LangChain?\', \'output\': \'I\\\'m sorry, but I couldn\\\'t find any information about ""LangChain"". Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?\'}, {\'input\': ""What\'s LangSmith?"", \'output\': \'I\\\'m sorry, but I couldn\\\'t find any information about ""LangSmith"". It could be a specific term or a company that is not widely known. Can you provide more context or clarify what you are referring to?\'}] ``` Assuming you\'ve successfully set up your environment, your agent traces should show up in the `Projects` section in the [app]( Congrats! ![Initial Runs](/assets/images/log_traces-edd14f0c4d5c320263362395793babdc.png) It looks like the agent isn\'t effectively using the tools though. Let\'s evaluate this so we have a baseline. ## Evaluate Agent In addition to logging runs, LangSmith also allows you to test and evaluate your LLM applications. In this section, you will leverage LangSmith to create a benchmark dataset and run AI-assisted evaluators on an agent. You will do so in a few steps: 1. Create a dataset 2. Initialize a new agent to benchmark 3. Configure evaluators to grade an agent\'s output 4. Run the agent over the dataset and evaluate the results ### 1. Create a LangSmith dataset Below, we use the LangSmith client to create a dataset from the input questions from above and a list labels. You will use these later to measure performance for a new agent. A dataset is a collection of examples, which are nothing more than input-output pairs you can use as test cases to your application. For more information on datasets, including how to create them from CSVs or other files or how to create them in the platform, please refer to the [LangSmith documentation]( ```python outputs = [ ""LangChain is an open-source framework for building applications using large language models. It is also the name of the company building LangSmith."", ""LangSmith is a unified platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring language model applications and agents powered by LangChain"", ""July 18, 2023"", ""The langsmith cookbook is a github repository containing detailed examples of how to use LangSmith to debug, evaluate, and monitor large language model-powered applications."", ""September 5, 2023"", ] ``` ```python dataset_name = f""agent-qa-{unique_id}"" dataset = client.create_dataset( dataset_name, description=""An example dataset of questions over the LangSmith documentation."", ) for query, answer in zip(inputs, outputs): client.create_example( inputs={""input"": query}, outputs={""output"": answer}, dataset_id=dataset.id ) ``` ### 2. Initialize a new agent to benchmark LangSmith lets you evaluate any LLM, chain, agent, or even a custom function. Conversational agents are stateful (they have memory); to ensure that this state isn\'t shared between dataset runs, we will pass in a `chain_factory` (aka a `constructor`) function to initialize for each call. In this case, we will test an agent that uses OpenAI\'s function calling endpoints. ```python from langchain import hub from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.agents.output_parsers import OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function # Since chains can be stateful (e.g. they can have memory), we provide # a way to initialize a new chain for each row in the dataset. This is done # by passing in a factory function that returns a new chain for each row. def agent_factory(prompt): llm_with_tools = llm.bind( functions=[format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools] ) runnable_agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) return AgentExecutor(agent=runnable_agent, tools=tools, handle_parsing_errors=True) ``` ### 3. Configure evaluation Manually comparing the results of chains in the UI is effective, but it can be time consuming. It can be helpful to use automated metrics and AI-assisted feedback to evaluate your component\'s performance. Below, we will create some pre-implemented run evaluators that do the following: - Compare results against ground truth labels. - Measure semantic (dis)similarity using embedding distance - Evaluate \'aspects\' of the agent\'s response in a reference-free manner using custom criteria For a longer discussion of how to select an appropriate evaluator for your use case and how to create your own custom evaluators, please refer to the [LangSmith documentation]( ```python from langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorType from langchain.smith import RunEvalConfig evaluation_config = RunEvalConfig( # Evaluators can either be an evaluator type (e.g., ""qa"", ""criteria"", ""embedding_distance"", etc.) or a configuration for that evaluator evaluators=[ # Measures whether a QA response is ""Correct"", based on a reference answer # You can also select via the raw string ""qa"" EvaluatorType.QA, # Measure the embedding distance between the output and the reference answer # Equivalent to: EvalConfig.EmbeddingDistance(embeddings=OpenAIEmbeddings()) EvaluatorType.EMBEDDING_DISTANCE, # Grade whether the output satisfies the stated criteria. # You can select a default one such as ""helpfulness"" or provide your own. RunEvalConfig.LabeledCriteria(""helpfulness""), # The LabeledScoreString evaluator outputs a score on a scale from 1-10. # You can use default criteria or write our own rubric RunEvalConfig.LabeledScoreString( { ""accuracy"": """""" Score 1: The answer is completely unrelated to the reference. Score 3: The answer has minor relevance but does not align with the reference. Score 5: The answer has moderate relevance but contains inaccuracies. Score 7: The answer aligns with the reference but has minor errors or omissions. Score 10: The answer is completely accurate and aligns perfectly with the reference."""""" }, normalize_by=10, ), ], # You can add custom StringEvaluator or RunEvaluator objects here as well, which will automatically be # applied to each prediction. Check out the docs for examples. custom_evaluators=[], ) ``` ### 4. Run the agent and evaluators Use the [run_on_dataset]( (or asynchronous [arun_on_dataset]( function to evaluate your model. This will: 1. Fetch example rows from the specified dataset. 2. Run your agent (or any custom function) on each example. 3. Apply evaluators to the resulting run traces and corresponding reference examples to generate automated feedback. The results will be visible in the LangSmith app. ```python from langchain import hub # We will test this version of the prompt prompt = hub.pull(""wfh/langsmith-agent-prompt:798e7324"") ``` ```python import functools from langchain.smith import ( arun_on_dataset, run_on_dataset, ) chain_results = run_on_dataset( dataset_name=dataset_name, llm_or_chain_factory=functools.partial(agent_factory, prompt=prompt), evaluation=evaluation_config, verbose=True, client=client, project_name=f""runnable-agent-test-5d466cbc-{unique_id}"", tags=[ ""testing-notebook"", ""prompt:5d466cbc"", ], # Optional, adds a tag to the resulting chain runs ) # Sometimes, the agent will error due to parsing issues, incompatible tool inputs, etc. # These are logged as warnings here and captured as errors in the tracing UI. ``` ```text View the evaluation results for project \'runnable-agent-test-5d466cbc-bf2162aa\' at: [> ] 0/5 Chain failed for example 54b4fce8-4492-409d-94af-708f51698b39 with inputs {\'input\': \'Who trained Llama-v2?\'} Error Type: TypeError, Message: DuckDuckGoSearchResults._run() got an unexpected keyword argument \'arg1\' [------------------------------------------------->] 5/5 Eval quantiles: 0.25 0.5 0.75 mean mode embedding_cosine_distance 0.086614 0.118841 0.183672 0.151444 0.050158 correctness 0.000000 0.500000 1.000000 0.500000 0.000000 score_string:accuracy 0.775000 1.000000 1.000000 0.775000 1.000000 helpfulness 0.750000 1.000000 1.000000 0.750000 1.000000 ``` ### Review the test results You can review the test results tracing UI below by clicking the URL in the output above or navigating to the ""Testing & Datasets"" page in LangSmith **""agent-qa-{unique_id}""** dataset. ![test results](/assets/images/test_results-15649f0f4500fd64ef2209229951a6c1.png) This will show the new runs and the feedback logged from the selected evaluators.

Let\'s fetch the run traces from the evaluation run. **Note: It may be a few moments before all the runs are accessible.** ```python runs = client.list_runs(project_name=chain_results[""project_name""], execution_order=1) ``` ```python # After some time, these will be populated. client.read_project(project_name=chain_results[""project_name""]).feedback_stats ``` ## Conclusion Congratulations!

Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`. Do not respond with more than one word. {question} Classification:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I call Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text \' Anthropic\' ``` Now, let\'s create three sub chains: ```python langchain_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in langchain. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Harrison Chase told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) anthropic_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in anthropic. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Dario Amodei told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) general_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch branch = RunnableBranch( (lambda x: ""anthropic"" in x[""topic""].lower(), anthropic_chain), (lambda x: ""langchain"" in x[""topic""].lower(), langchain_chain), general_chain, ) ``` ```python full_chain = {""topic"": chain, ""question"": lambda x: x[""question""]} | branch ``` ```python full_chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I use Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content="" As Dario Amodei told me, here are some ways to use Anthropic:\\n\\n- Sign up for an account on Anthropic\'s website to access tools like Claude, Constitutional AI, and Writer. \\n\\n- Use Claude for tasks like email generation, customer service chat, and QA.

24,What's an LLMChain,"['LangSmith LLM Runs | LangSmith LLM Runs This notebook demonstrates how to directly load data from LangSmith\'s LLM runs and fine-tune a model on that data. The process is simple and comprises 3 steps. 1. Select the LLM runs to train on. 2. Use the LangSmithRunChatLoader to load runs as chat sessions. 3. Fine-tune your model. Then you can use the fine-tuned model in your LangChain app. Before diving in, let\'s install our prerequisites. ## Prerequisites Ensure you\'ve installed langchain >= 0.0.311 and have configured your environment with your LangSmith API key. ```python %pip install -U langchain openai ``` ```python import os import uuid uid = uuid.uuid4().hex[:6] project_name = f""Run Fine-tuning Walkthrough {uid}"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = ""YOUR API KEY"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_PROJECT""] = project_name ``` ## 1. Select Runs The first step is selecting which runs to fine-tune on. A common case would be to select LLM runs within traces that have received positive user feedback. You can find examples of this in the[LangSmith Cookbook]( and in the [docs]( For the sake of this tutorial, we will generate some runs for you to use here. Let\'s try fine-tuning a simple function-calling chain. ```python from enum import Enum from langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field class Operation(Enum): add = ""+"" subtract = ""-"" multiply = ""*"" divide = ""/"" class Calculator(BaseModel): """"""A calculator function"""""" num1: float num2: float operation: Operation = Field(..., description=""+,-,*,/"") def calculate(self): if self.operation == Operation.add: return self.num1 + self.num2 elif self.operation == Operation.subtract: return self.num1 - self.num2 elif self.operation == Operation.multiply: return self.num1 * self.num2 elif self.operation == Operation.divide: if self.num2 != 0: return self.num1 / self.num2 else: return ""Cannot divide by zero"" ``` ```python from pprint import pprint from langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel from langchain.utils.openai_functions import convert_pydantic_to_openai_function openai_function_def = convert_pydantic_to_openai_function(Calculator) pprint(openai_function_def) ``` ```text {\'description\': \'A calculator function\', \'name\': \'Calculator\', \'parameters\': {\'description\': \'A calculator function\', \'properties\': {\'num1\': {\'title\': \'Num1\', \'type\': \'number\'}, \'num2\': {\'title\': \'Num2\', \'type\': \'number\'}, \'operation\': {\'allOf\': [{\'description\': \'An \' \'enumeration.\', \'enum\': [\'+\', \'-\', \'*\', \'/\'], \'title\': \'Operation\'}], \'description\': \'+,-,*,/\'}}, \'required\': [\'num1\', \'num2\', \'operation\'], \'title\': \'Calculator\', \'type\': \'object\'}} ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.output_parsers.openai_functions import PydanticOutputFunctionsParser from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are an accounting assistant.""), (""user"", ""{input}""), ] ) chain = ( prompt | ChatOpenAI().bind(functions=[openai_function_def]) | PydanticOutputFunctionsParser(pydantic_schema=Calculator) | (lambda x: x.calculate()) ) ``` ```python math_questions = [ ""What\'s 45/9?"", ""What\'s 81/9?"", ""What\'s 72/8?"", ""What\'s 56/7?"", ""What\'s 36/6?"", ""What\'s 64/8?"", ""What\'s 12*6?"", ""What\'s 8*8?"", ""What\'s 10*10?"", ""What\'s 11*11?"", ""What\'s 13*13?"", ""What\'s 45+30?"", ""What\'s 72+28?"", ""What\'s 56+44?"", ""What\'s 63+37?"", ""What\'s 70-35?"", ""What\'s 60-30?"", ""What\'s 50-25?"", ""What\'s 40-20?"", ""What\'s 30-15?"", ] results = chain.batch([{""input"": q} for q in math_questions], return_exceptions=True) ``` ```text Retrying langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI.completion_with_retry.._completion_with_retry in 4.0 seconds as it raised ServiceUnavailableError: The server is overloaded or not ready yet.. ``` #### Load runs that did not error Now we can select the successful runs to fine-tune on. ```python from langsmith.client import Client client = Client() ``` ```python successful_traces = { run.trace_id for run in client.list_runs( project_name=project_name, execution_order=1, error=False, ) } llm_runs = [ run for run in client.list_runs( project_name=project_name, run_type=""llm"", ) if run.trace_id in successful_traces ] ``` ## 2. Prepare data Now we can create an instance of LangSmithRunChatLoader and load the chat sessions using its lazy_load() method. ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.langsmith import LangSmithRunChatLoader loader = LangSmithRunChatLoader(runs=llm_runs) chat_sessions = loader.lazy_load() ``` #### With the chat sessions loaded, convert them into a format suitable for fine-tuning. ```python from langchain.adapters.openai import convert_messages_for_finetuning training_data = convert_messages_for_finetuning(chat_sessions) ``` ## 3. Fine-tune the model Now, initiate the fine-tuning process using the OpenAI library. ```python import json import time from io import BytesIO import openai my_file = BytesIO() for dialog in training_data: my_file.write((json.dumps({""messages"": dialog}) + ""\\n"").encode(""utf-8"")) my_file.seek(0) training_file = openai.File.create(file=my_file, purpose=""fine-tune"") job = openai.FineTuningJob.create( training_file=training_file.id, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) # Wait for the fine-tuning to complete (this may take some time) status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""succeeded"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status # Now your model is fine-tuned! ``` ```text Status=[running]... 346.26s. 31.70s ``` ## 4. Use in LangChain After fine-tuning, use the resulting model ID with the ChatOpenAI model class in your LangChain app. ```python # Get the fine-tuned model ID job = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id) model_id = job.fine_tuned_model # Use the fine-tuned model in LangChain model = ChatOpenAI( model=model_id, temperature=1, ) ``` ```python (prompt | model).invoke({""input"": ""What\'s 56/7?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'{\\n ""num1"": 56,\\n ""num2"": 7,\\n ""operation"": ""/""\\n}\') ``` Now you have successfully fine-tuned a model using data from LangSmith LLM runs! - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) - [1. Select Runs](#1-select-runs) - [2. Prepare data](#2-prepare-data) - [3. Fine-tune the model](#3-fine-tune-the-model) - [4. Use in LangChain](#4-use-in-langchain)', 'MyScale | MyScale [MyScale]( is an integrated vector database. You can access your database in SQL and also from here, LangChain. `MyScale` can make use of [various data types and functions for filters]( It will boost up your LLM app no matter if you are scaling up your data or expand your system to broader application. In the notebook, we\'ll demo the `SelfQueryRetriever` wrapped around a `MyScale` vector store with some extra pieces we contributed to LangChain. In short, it can be condensed into 4 points: 1. Add `contain` comparator to match the list of any if there is more than one element matched 2. Add `timestamp` data type for datetime match (ISO-format, or YYYY-MM-DD) 3. Add `like` comparator for string pattern search 4. Add arbitrary function capability ## Creating a MyScale vector store MyScale has already been integrated to LangChain for a while. So you can follow [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/myscale) to create your own vectorstore for a self-query retriever. **Note:** All self-query retrievers requires you to have `lark` installed (`pip install lark`). We use `lark` for grammar definition. Before you proceed to the next step, we also want to remind you that `clickhouse-connect` is also needed to interact with your MyScale backend. ```bash pip install lark clickhouse-connect ``` In this tutorial we follow other example\'s setting and use `OpenAIEmbeddings`. Remember to get an OpenAI API Key for valid access to LLMs. ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") os.environ[""MYSCALE_HOST""] = getpass.getpass(""MyScale URL:"") os.environ[""MYSCALE_PORT""] = getpass.getpass(""MyScale Port:"") os.environ[""MYSCALE_USERNAME""] = getpass.getpass(""MyScale Username:"") os.environ[""MYSCALE_PASSWORD""] = getpass.getpass(""MyScale Password:"") ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import Document from langchain.vectorstores import MyScale embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ## Create some sample data As you can see, the data we created has some differences compared to other self-query retrievers. We replaced the keyword `year` with `date` which gives you finer control on timestamps. We also changed the type of the keyword `gerne` to a list of strings, where an LLM can use a new `contain` comparator to construct filters. We also provide the `like` comparator and arbitrary function support to filters, which will be introduced in next few cells. Now let\'s look at the data first. ```python docs = [ Document( page_content=""A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose"", metadata={""date"": ""1993-07-02"", ""rating"": 7.7, ""genre"": [""science fiction""]}, ), Document( page_content=""Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ..."", metadata={""date"": ""2010-12-30"", ""director"": ""Christopher Nolan"", ""rating"": 8.2}, ), Document( page_content=""A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea"", metadata={""date"": ""2006-04-23"", ""director"": ""Satoshi Kon"", ""rating"": 8.6}, ), Document( page_content=""A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them"", metadata={""date"": ""2019-08-22"", ""director"": ""Greta Gerwig"", ""rating"": 8.3}, ), Document( page_content=""Toys come alive and have a blast doing so"", metadata={""date"": ""1995-02-11"", ""genre"": [""animated""]}, ), Document( page_content=""Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone"", metadata={ ""date"": ""1979-09-10"", ""director"": ""Andrei Tarkovsky"", ""genre"": [""science fiction"", ""adventure""], ""rating"": 9.9, }, ), ] vectorstore = MyScale.from_documents( docs, embeddings, ) ``` ## Creating our self-querying retriever Just like other retrievers... simple and nice. ```python from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever metadata_field_info = [ AttributeInfo( name=""genre"", description=""The genres of the movie"", type=""list[string]"", ), # If you want to include length of a list, just define it as a new column # This will teach the LLM to use it as a column when constructing filter. AttributeInfo( name=""length(genre)"", description=""The length of genres of the movie"", type=""integer"", ), # Now you can define a column as timestamp. By simply set the type to timestamp. AttributeInfo( name=""date"", description=""The date the movie was released"", type=""timestamp"", ), AttributeInfo( name=""director"", description=""The name of the movie director"", type=""string"", ), AttributeInfo( name=""rating"", description=""A 1-10 rating for the movie"", type=""float"" ), ] document_content_description = ""Brief summary of a movie"" llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm( llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True ) ``` ## Testing it out with self-query retriever\'s existing functionalities And now we can try actually using our retriever! ```python # This example only specifies a relevant query retriever.get_relevant_documents(""What are some movies about dinosaurs"") ``` ```python # This example only specifies a filter retriever.get_relevant_documents(""I want to watch a movie rated higher than 8.5"") ``` ```python # This example specifies a query and a filter retriever.get_relevant_documents(""Has Greta Gerwig directed any movies about women"") ``` ```python # This example specifies a composite filter retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What\'s a highly rated (above 8.5) science fiction film?"" ) ``` ```python # This example specifies a query and composite filter retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What\'s a movie after 1990 but before 2005 that\'s all about toys, and preferably is animated"" ) ``` # Wait a second... what else? Self-query retriever with MyScale can do more! Let\'s find out. ```python # You can use length(genres) to do anything you want retriever.get_relevant_documents(""What\'s a movie that have more than 1 genres?"") ``` ```python # Fine-grained datetime? You got it already. retriever.get_relevant_documents(""What\'s a movie that release after feb 1995?"") ``` ```python # Don\'t know what your exact filter should be? Use string pattern match! retriever.get_relevant_documents(""What\'s a movie whose name is like Andrei?"") ``` ```python # Contain works for lists: so you can match a list with contain comparator! retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What\'s a movie who has genres science fiction and adventure?"" ) ``` ## Filter k We can also use the self query retriever to specify `k`: the number of documents to fetch. We can do this by passing `enable_limit=True` to the constructor. ```python retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm( llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, enable_limit=True, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python # This example only specifies a relevant query retriever.get_relevant_documents(""what are two movies about dinosaurs"") ``` - [Creating a MyScale vector store](#creating-a-myscale-vector-store) - [Create some sample data](#create-some-sample-data) - [Creating our self-querying retriever](#creating-our-self-querying-retriever) - [Testing it out with self-query retriever\'s existing functionalities](#testing-it-out-with-self-query-retrievers-existing-functionalities) - [Filter k](#filter-k)', 'Criteria Evaluation | Criteria Evaluation []( In scenarios where you wish to assess a model\'s output using a specific rubric or criteria set, the `criteria` evaluator proves to be a handy tool. It allows you to verify if an LLM or Chain\'s output complies with a defined set of criteria. To understand its functionality and configurability in depth, refer to the reference documentation of the [CriteriaEvalChain]( class. ### Usage without references In this example, you will use the `CriteriaEvalChain` to check whether an output is concise. First, create the evaluation chain to predict whether outputs are ""concise"". ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", criteria=""conciseness"") # This is equivalent to loading using the enum from langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorType evaluator = load_evaluator(EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'The criterion is conciseness, which means the submission should be brief and to the point. \\n\\nLooking at the submission, the answer to the question ""What\\\'s 2+2?"" is indeed ""four"". However, the respondent has added extra information, stating ""That\\\'s an elementary question."" This statement does not contribute to answering the question and therefore makes the response less concise.\\n\\nTherefore, the submission does not meet the criterion of conciseness.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` #### Output Format All string evaluators expose an [evaluate_strings]( (or async [aevaluate_strings]( method, which accepts: - input (str) The input to the agent. - prediction (str) The predicted response. The criteria evaluators return a dictionary with the following values: - score: Binary integer 0 to 1, where 1 would mean that the output is compliant with the criteria, and 0 otherwise - value: A ""Y"" or ""N"" corresponding to the score - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Using Reference Labels Some criteria (such as correctness) require reference labels to work correctly. To do this, initialize the `labeled_criteria` evaluator and call the evaluator with a `reference` string. ```python evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"") # We can even override the model\'s learned knowledge using ground truth labels eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( input=""What is the capital of the US?"", prediction=""Topeka, KS"", reference=""The capital of the US is Topeka, KS, where it permanently moved from Washington D.C. on May 16, 2023"", ) print(f\'With ground truth: {eval_result[""score""]}\') ``` ```text With ground truth: 1 ``` **Default Criteria** Most of the time, you\'ll want to define your own custom criteria (see below), but we also provide some common criteria you can load with a single string. Here\'s a list of pre-implemented criteria. Note that in the absence of labels, the LLM merely predicts what it thinks the best answer is and is not grounded in actual law or context. ```python from langchain.evaluation import Criteria # For a list of other default supported criteria, try calling `supported_default_criteria` list(Criteria) ``` ```text [, , , , , , , , , , ] ``` ## Custom Criteria To evaluate outputs against your own custom criteria, or to be more explicit the definition of any of the default criteria, pass in a dictionary of `""criterion_name"": ""criterion_description""` Note: it\'s recommended that you create a single evaluator per criterion. This way, separate feedback can be provided for each aspect. Additionally, if you provide antagonistic criteria, the evaluator won\'t be very useful, as it will be configured to predict compliance for ALL of the criteria provided. ```python custom_criterion = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric or mathematical information?"" } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criterion, ) query = ""Tell me a joke"" prediction = ""I ate some square pie but I don\'t know the square of pi."" eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(eval_result) # If you wanted to specify multiple criteria. Generally not recommended custom_criteria = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric information?"", ""mathematical"": ""Does the output contain mathematical information?"", ""grammatical"": ""Is the output grammatically correct?"", ""logical"": ""Is the output logical?"", } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criteria, ) eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(""Multi-criteria evaluation"") print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The criterion asks if the output contains numeric or mathematical information. The joke in the submission does contain mathematical information. It refers to the mathematical concept of squaring a number and also mentions \'pi\', which is a mathematical constant. Therefore, the submission does meet the criterion.\\n\\nY"", \'value\': \'Y\', \'score\': 1} {\'reasoning\': \'Let\\\'s assess the submission based on the given criteria:\\n\\n1. Numeric: The output does not contain any explicit numeric information. The word ""square"" and ""pi"" are mathematical terms but they are not numeric information per se.\\n\\n2. Mathematical: The output does contain mathematical information. The terms ""square"" and ""pi"" are mathematical terms. The joke is a play on the mathematical concept of squaring a number (in this case, pi).\\n\\n3. Grammatical: The output is grammatically correct. The sentence structure, punctuation, and word usage are all correct.\\n\\n4. Logical: The output is logical. It makes sense within the context of the joke.

For example, if the assistant says anything that encourages dangerous or illegal activity, make sure to point it out. Other examples of harm include racism, sexism, and other social biases.\', revision_request=\'Please rewrite the assistant response to remove any and all harmful content, including anything dangerous, illegal, racist, sexist or socially biased.\', name=\'harmful2\')), (\'harmful3\', ConstitutionalPrinciple(critique_request=\'Identify all ways in which the assistant\'s last response is harmful, unethical, or socially biased. Furthermore, provide specific details on how the assistant can improve its response.\', revision_request=\'Please rewrite the assistant response to remove all harmful, unethical, or socially biased content, and move the conversation in a positive direction.\', name=\'harmful3\')), (\'harmful4\', ConstitutionalPrinciple(critique_request=\'Identify specific ways in which the assistant\'s precedings response is harmful. Also point out potential harmfulness in the human\'s questions and responses. Examples of harm include but are not limited to racism, sexism, toxicity.\', revision_request=\'Rewrite the assistant response to remove all harmful content, and to politely point out any harmful assumptions from the human, such as racism, sexism, toxicity.\', name=\'harmful4\')), (\'insensitive\', ConstitutionalPrinciple(critique_request=\'Discuss the assistant\'s last response to the human and whether it is in any way insensitive, sexist, racist, or socially inappropriate.\', revision_request=\'Revise the assistant\'s last response to remove content that is in any way insensitive, sexist, racist, or socially inappropriate.\', name=\'insensitive\'))] ``` ```python evaluator = load_evaluator(EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=PRINCIPLES[""harmful1""]) eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""I say that man is a lilly-livered nincompoop"", input=""What do you think of Will?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'The criterion asks to identify if the assistant\\\'s response is harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal.\\n\\nLooking at the assistant\\\'s response, it is clear that it is not racist or sexist as it does not discriminate or stereotype based on race or gender. \\n\\nThe response is also not illegal as it does not involve any criminal activity or encourage any form of illegal behavior.\\n\\nThe response is not dangerous as it does not pose a physical threat or risk to anyone\\\'s safety.\\n\\nHowever, the assistant\\\'s response can be considered harmful and toxic as it uses derogatory language (""lilly-livered nincompoop"") to describe \\\'Will\\\'. This can be seen as a form of verbal abuse or insult, which can cause emotional harm.\\n\\nThe response can also be seen as unethical, as it is generally considered inappropriate to insult or belittle someone in this manner.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Configuring the LLM If you don\'t specify an eval LLM, the `load_evaluator` method will initialize a `gpt-4` LLM to power the grading chain. Below, use an anthropic model instead. ```python # %pip install ChatAnthropic # %env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", llm=llm, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Step 1) Analyze the conciseness criterion: Is the submission concise and to the point?\\nStep 2) The submission provides extraneous information beyond just answering the question directly. It characterizes the question as ""elementary"" and provides reasoning for why the answer is 4. This additional commentary makes the submission not fully concise.\\nStep 3) Therefore, based on the analysis of the conciseness criterion, the submission does not meet the criteria.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` # Configuring the Prompt If you want to completely customize the prompt, you can initialize the evaluator with a custom prompt template as follows. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate fstring = """"""Respond Y or N based on how well the following response follows the specified rubric. Grade only based on the rubric and expected response: Grading Rubric: {criteria} Expected Response: {reference} DATA: --------- Question: {input} Response: {output} --------- Write out your explanation for each criterion, then respond with Y or N on a new line."""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(fstring) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"", prompt=prompt) ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", reference=""It\'s 17 now."", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Correctness: No, the response is not correct. The expected response was ""It\\\'s 17 now."" but the response given was ""What\\\'s 2+2? That\\\'s an elementary question. The answer you\\\'re looking for is that two and two is four.""\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Conclusion In these examples, you used the `CriteriaEvalChain` to evaluate model outputs against custom criteria, including a custom rubric and constitutional principles. Remember when selecting criteria to decide whether they ought to require ground truth labels or not. Things like ""correctness"" are best evaluated with ground truth or with extensive context. Also, remember to pick aligned principles for a given chain so that the classification makes sense. - [Usage without references](#usage-without-references) - [Using Reference Labels](#using-reference-labels) - [Custom Criteria](#custom-criteria) - [Using Constitutional Principles](#using-constitutional-principles) - [Configuring the LLM](#configuring-the-llm) - [Conclusion](#conclusion)']","An LLMChain in LangChain is a chain of language model (LLM) calls that can be used to build complex workflows. It allows you to connect multiple LLM calls in a sequence, where the output of one call becomes the input for the next. This is useful for creating multi-step tasks that require the language model to generate, refine, or act on its own outputs iteratively.

Here's a simple example of how you might use an LLMChain:

```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.llms import HuggingFaceLLM

# Define the language model
llm = HuggingFaceLLM(model_id=""your-model-id"")

# Define the first step of the chain
first_step = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=""Write a short story about a talking cat."")

# Define the second step of the chain
second_step = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=""Continue the story with the cat discovering a secret."")

# Combine the steps into a chain
chain = LLMChain(chain=[first_step, second_step])

# Run the chain
output = chain.run()
print(output)
```

In this example, the first LLMChain generates a short story about a talking cat, and the second LLMChain continues the story with the cat discovering a secret. The `chain.run()` method executes both steps sequentially, with the output of the first step becoming the input for the second step.","An LLMChain is a chain that composes basic LLM functionality. It consists of a PromptTemplate and a language model (either an LLM or chat model). It formats the prompt template using the input key values provided (and also memory key values, if available), passes the formatted string to LLM and returns the LLM output.",0.9999999999,0.75,,0.13871452725344985,0.15730337078651685
25,What's the difference between a prompt template and a chat prompt template?,"['Few-shot examples for chat models | Few-shot examples for chat models This notebook covers how to use few-shot examples in chat models. There does not appear to be solid consensus on how best to do few-shot prompting, and the optimal prompt compilation will likely vary by model. Because of this, we provide few-shot prompt templates like the [FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate]( as a flexible starting point, and you can modify or replace them as you see fit. The goal of few-shot prompt templates are to dynamically select examples based on an input, and then format the examples in a final prompt to provide for the model. **Note:** The following code examples are for chat models. For similar few-shot prompt examples for completion models (LLMs), see the [few-shot prompt templates](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/few_shot_examples) guide. ### Fixed Examples The most basic (and common) few-shot prompting technique is to use a fixed prompt example. This way you can select a chain, evaluate it, and avoid worrying about additional moving parts in production. The basic components of the template are: - `examples`: A list of dictionary examples to include in the final prompt. - `example_prompt`: converts each example into 1 or more messages through its [format_messages]( method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message. Below is a simple demonstration. First, import the modules for this example: ```python from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate, ) ``` Then, define the examples you\'d like to include. ```python examples = [ {""input"": ""2+2"", ""output"": ""4""}, {""input"": ""2+3"", ""output"": ""5""}, ] ``` Next, assemble them into the few-shot prompt template. ```python # This is a prompt template used to format each individual example. example_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""human"", ""{input}""), (""ai"", ""{output}""), ] ) few_shot_prompt = FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate( example_prompt=example_prompt, examples=examples, ) print(few_shot_prompt.format()) ``` ```text Human: 2+2 AI: 4 Human: 2+3 AI: 5 ``` Finally, assemble your final prompt and use it with a model. ```python final_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a wondrous wizard of math.""), few_shot_prompt, (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic chain = final_prompt | ChatAnthropic(temperature=0.0) chain.invoke({""input"": ""What\'s the square of a triangle?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\' Triangles do not have a ""square"". A square refers to a shape with 4 equal sides and 4 right angles. Triangles have 3 sides and 3 angles.\\n\\nThe area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:\\n\\nA = 1/2 * b * h\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\nA is the area \\nb is the base (the length of one of the sides)\\nh is the height (the length from the base to the opposite vertex)\\n\\nSo the area depends on the specific dimensions of the triangle. There is no single ""square of a triangle"". The area can vary greatly depending on the base and height measurements.\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` ## Dynamic few-shot prompting Sometimes you may want to condition which examples are shown based on the input. For this, you can replace the `examples` with an `example_selector`. The other components remain the same as above! To review, the dynamic few-shot prompt template would look like: - `example_selector`: responsible for selecting few-shot examples (and the order in which they are returned) for a given input. These implement the [BaseExampleSelector]( interface. A common example is the vectorstore-backed [SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector]( - `example_prompt`: convert each example into 1 or more messages through its [format_messages]( method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message. These once again can be composed with other messages and chat templates to assemble your final prompt. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.prompts import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` Since we are using a vectorstore to select examples based on semantic similarity, we will want to first populate the store. ```python examples = [ {""input"": ""2+2"", ""output"": ""4""}, {""input"": ""2+3"", ""output"": ""5""}, {""input"": ""2+4"", ""output"": ""6""}, {""input"": ""What did the cow say to the moon?"", ""output"": ""nothing at all""}, { ""input"": ""Write me a poem about the moon"", ""output"": ""One for the moon, and one for me, who are we to talk about the moon?"", }, ] to_vectorize = ["" "".join(example.values()) for example in examples] embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectorstore = Chroma.from_texts(to_vectorize, embeddings, metadatas=examples) ``` #### Create the example_selector With a vectorstore created, you can create the `example_selector`. Here we will isntruct it to only fetch the top 2 examples. ```python example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector( vectorstore=vectorstore, k=2, ) # The prompt template will load examples by passing the input do the `select_examples` method example_selector.select_examples({""input"": ""horse""}) ``` ```text [{\'input\': \'What did the cow say to the moon?\', \'output\': \'nothing at all\'}, {\'input\': \'2+4\', \'output\': \'6\'}] ``` #### Create prompt template Assemble the prompt template, using the `example_selector` created above. ```python from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate, ) # Define the few-shot prompt. few_shot_prompt = FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate( # The input variables select the values to pass to the example_selector input_variables=[""input""], example_selector=example_selector, # Define how each example will be formatted. # In this case, each example will become 2 messages: # 1 human, and 1 AI example_prompt=ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [(""human"", ""{input}""), (""ai"", ""{output}"")] ), ) ``` Below is an example of how this would be assembled. ```python print(few_shot_prompt.format(input=""What\'s 3+3?"")) ``` ```text Human: 2+3 AI: 5 Human: 2+2 AI: 4 ``` Assemble the final prompt template: ```python final_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a wondrous wizard of math.""), few_shot_prompt, (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) ``` ```python print(few_shot_prompt.format(input=""What\'s 3+3?"")) ``` ```text Human: 2+3 AI: 5 Human: 2+2 AI: 4 ``` #### Use with an LLM Now, you can connect your model to the few-shot prompt. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic chain = final_prompt | ChatAnthropic(temperature=0.0) chain.invoke({""input"": ""What\'s 3+3?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\' 3 + 3 = 6\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` - [Fixed Examples](#fixed-examples) - [Dynamic few-shot prompting](#dynamic-few-shot-prompting)', 'Customizing Conversational Memory | Customizing Conversational Memory This notebook walks through a few ways to customize conversational memory. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ## AI prefix The first way to do so is by changing the AI prefix in the conversation summary.

26,What is ConversationSummaryBufferMemory?,"['Chatbots | Chatbots []( ## Use case Chatbots are one of the central LLM use-cases. The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering).

It keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, but rather than just completely flushing old interactions it compiles them into a summary and uses both. It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. Let\'s first walk through how to use the utilities. ## Using memory with LLM ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory llm = OpenAI() ``` ```python memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'System: \\nThe human says ""hi"", and the AI responds with ""whats up"".\\nHuman: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model). ```python memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory( llm=llm, max_token_limit=10, return_messages=True ) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` We can also utilize the `predict_new_summary` method directly. ```python messages = memory.chat_memory.messages previous_summary = """" memory.predict_new_summary(messages, previous_summary) ``` ```text \'\\nThe human and AI state that they are not doing much.\' ``` ## Using in a chain Let\'s walk through an example, again setting `verbose=True` so we can see the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain( llm=llm, # We set a very low max_token_limit for the purposes of testing. memory=ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=OpenAI(), max_token_limit=40), verbose=True, ) conversation_with_summary.predict(input=""Hi, what\'s up?"") ``` ```text > Entering new ConversationChain chain...

The Embeddings class is a class designed for interfacing with text embedding models. There are lots of embedding model providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - this class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them. Embeddings create a vector representation of a piece of text. This is useful because it means we can think about text in the vector space, and do things like semantic search where we look for pieces of text that are most similar in the vector space. The base Embeddings class in LangChain provides two methods: one for embedding documents and one for embedding a query. The former takes as input multiple texts, while the latter takes a single text. The reason for having these as two separate methods is that some embedding providers have different embedding methods for documents (to be searched over) vs queries (the search query itself). ## Get started ### Setup To start we\'ll need to install the OpenAI Python package: ```bash pip install openai ``` Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading [here]( Once we have a key we\'ll want to set it as an environment variable by running: ```bash export OPENAI_API_KEY=""..."" ``` If you\'d prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the `openai_api_key` named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class: ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=""..."") ``` Otherwise you can initialize without any params: ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ### embed_documents #### Embed list of texts ```python embeddings = embeddings_model.embed_documents( [ ""Hi there!"", ""Oh, hello!"", ""What\'s your name?"", ""My friends call me World"", ""Hello World!"" ] ) len(embeddings), len(embeddings[0]) ``` ```text (5, 1536) ``` ### embed_query #### Embed single query Embed a single piece of text for the purpose of comparing to other embedded pieces of texts. ```python embedded_query = embeddings_model.embed_query(""What was the name mentioned in the conversation?"") embedded_query[:5] ``` ```text [0.0053587136790156364, -0.0004999046213924885, 0.038883671164512634, -0.003001077566295862, -0.00900818221271038] ``` - [Get started](#get-started)- [Setup](#setup) - [embed_documents](#embed_documents) - [embed_query](#embed_query)', 'Caching | Caching LangChain provides an optional caching layer for LLMs. This is useful for two reasons: It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider, if you\'re often requesting the same completion multiple times. It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider. ```python from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache from langchain.llms import OpenAI # To make the caching really obvious, lets use a slower model. llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", n=2, best_of=2) ``` ## In Memory Cache ```python from langchain.cache import InMemoryCache set_llm_cache(InMemoryCache()) # The first time, it is not yet in cache, so it should take longer llm.predict(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 35.9 ms, sys: 28.6 ms, total: 64.6 ms Wall time: 4.83 s ""\\n\\nWhy couldn\'t the bicycle stand up by itself?

Note that because of certain interfaces, it\'s often easier to construct the chain first, and then edit the LLM afterwards. As an example, we will load a summarizer map-reduce chain. We will cache results for the map-step, but then not freeze it for the combine step. ```python llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"") no_cache_llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", cache=False) ``` ```python from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.chains.mapreduce import MapReduceChain text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter() ``` ```python with open(\'../../../state_of_the_union.txt\') as f: state_of_the_union = f.read() texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union) ``` ```python from langchain.docstore.document import Document docs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts[:3]] from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain ``` ```python chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"", reduce_llm=no_cache_llm) ``` ```python chain.run(docs) ``` ```text CPU times: user 452 ms, sys: 60.3 ms, total: 512 ms Wall time: 5.09 s \'\\n\\nPresident Biden is discussing the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will create jobs and help Americans.

American forces are being mobilized to protect NATO countries in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting back, but the next few weeks will be hard for them. Putin will pay a high price for his actions in the long run. Americans should not be alarmed, as the United States is taking action to protect its interests and allies.\' ``` When we run it again, we see that it runs substantially faster but the final answer is different.

Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. As a very simple example, let\'s suppose we have two templates optimized for different types of questions, and we want to choose the template based on the user input. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate physics_template = """"""You are a very smart physics professor. \\ You are great at answering questions about physics in a concise and easy to understand manner. \\ When you don\'t know the answer to a question you admit that you don\'t know.

Here is a question: {input}"""""" math_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(math_template) ``` ## Using LCEL We can easily do this using a `RunnableBranch`. A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch ``` ```python general_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a helpful assistant.

Router chains are made up of two components: - The `RouterChain` itself (responsible for selecting the next chain to call) - `destination_chains`: chains that the router chain can route to In this example, we will focus on the different types of routing chains. We will show these routing chains used in a `MultiPromptChain` to create a question-answering chain that selects the prompt which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using that prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.chains.router import MultiPromptChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` ### [Legacy] LLMRouterChain This chain uses an LLM to determine how to route things. ```python prompt_infos = [ { ""name"": ""physics"", ""description"": ""Good for answering questions about physics"", ""prompt_template"": physics_template, }, { ""name"": ""math"", ""description"": ""Good for answering math questions"", ""prompt_template"": math_template, }, ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() ``` ```python destination_chains = {} for p_info in prompt_infos: name = p_info[""name""] prompt_template = p_info[""prompt_template""] prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=[""input""]) chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) destination_chains[name] = chain default_chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, output_key=""text"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains.router.llm_router import LLMRouterChain, RouterOutputParser from langchain.chains.router.multi_prompt_prompt import MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE ``` ```python destinations = [f""{p[\'name\']}: {p[\'description\']}"" for p in prompt_infos] destinations_str = ""\\n"".join(destinations) router_template = MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE.format(destinations=destinations_str) router_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=router_template, input_variables=[""input""], output_parser=RouterOutputParser(), ) router_chain = LLMRouterChain.from_llm(llm, router_prompt) ``` ```python chain = MultiPromptChain( router_chain=router_chain, destination_chains=destination_chains, default_chain=default_chain, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is black body radiation?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is black body radiation?\'} > Finished chain.

The spectral characteristics of the radiation are determined by the temperature of the body, which implies that a black body at a given temperature will emit the same amount of radiation at every frequency. ``` ```python print( chain.run( ""What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?"" ) ) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( math: {\'input\': \'What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?\'} > Finished chain. The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43. This can be seen by breaking down the problem: 1) We know that a prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and one. 2) We also know that if a number is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. So, if we want to find the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3, we can start counting up from 40, testing each number to see if it is prime and if the sum of the number and one is divisible by three. The first number we come to that satisfies these conditions is 43. ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?\'} > Finished chain.

The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1. Simple prompting: Agents can use Language Model based prompting to break down tasks into subgoals. For example, by providing prompts like ""Steps for XYZ"" or ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", the agent can generate a sequence of smaller steps that lead to the completion of the overall task.\\n\\n2. Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to ""Write a story outline.""

Long-Term Memory Management: This involves storing and organizing information in a long-term memory system. The agent can retrieve past experiences, knowledge, and learned strategies to guide the task decomposition process.\\n\\n2. Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents.

31,What is the main purpose of the time-weighted vector store retriever?,"['Time-weighted vector store retriever | Time-weighted vector store retriever This retriever uses a combination of semantic similarity and a time decay. The algorithm for scoring them is: ```text semantic_similarity + (1.0 - decay_rate) ^ hours_passed ``` Notably, `hours_passed` refers to the hours passed since the object in the retriever **was last accessed**, not since it was created. This means that frequently accessed objects remain ""fresh"". ```python import faiss from datetime import datetime, timedelta from langchain.docstore import InMemoryDocstore from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.retrievers import TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever from langchain.schema import Document from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS ``` ## Low decay rate A low `decay rate` (in this, to be extreme, we will set it close to 0) means memories will be ""remembered"" for longer. A `decay rate` of 0 means memories never be forgotten, making this retriever equivalent to the vector lookup. ```python # Define your embedding model embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings() # Initialize the vectorstore as empty embedding_size = 1536 index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size) vectorstore = FAISS(embeddings_model.embed_query, index, InMemoryDocstore({}), {}) retriever = TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=vectorstore, decay_rate=.0000000000000000000000001, k=1) ``` ```python yesterday = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1) retriever.add_documents([Document(page_content=""hello world"", metadata={""last_accessed_at"": yesterday})]) retriever.add_documents([Document(page_content=""hello foo"")]) ``` ```text [\'d7f85756-2371-4bdf-9140-052780a0f9b3\'] ``` ```python # ""Hello World"" is returned first because it is most salient, and the decay rate is close to 0., meaning it\'s still recent enough retriever.get_relevant_documents(""hello world"") ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'hello world\', metadata={\'last_accessed_at\': datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 13, 21, 0, 27, 678341), \'created_at\': datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 13, 21, 0, 27, 279596), \'buffer_idx\': 0})] ``` ## High decay rate With a high `decay rate` (e.g., several 9\'s), the `recency score` quickly goes to 0! If you set this all the way to 1, `recency` is 0 for all objects, once again making this equivalent to a vector lookup. ```python # Define your embedding model embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings() # Initialize the vectorstore as empty embedding_size = 1536 index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size) vectorstore = FAISS(embeddings_model.embed_query, index, InMemoryDocstore({}), {}) retriever = TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=vectorstore, decay_rate=.999, k=1) ``` ```python yesterday = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1) retriever.add_documents([Document(page_content=""hello world"", metadata={""last_accessed_at"": yesterday})]) retriever.add_documents([Document(page_content=""hello foo"")]) ``` ```text [\'40011466-5bbe-4101-bfd1-e22e7f505de2\'] ``` ```python # ""Hello Foo"" is returned first because ""hello world"" is mostly forgotten retriever.get_relevant_documents(""hello world"") ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'hello foo\', metadata={\'last_accessed_at\': datetime.datetime(2023, 4, 16, 22, 9, 2, 494798), \'created_at\': datetime.datetime(2023, 4, 16, 22, 9, 2, 178722), \'buffer_idx\': 1})] ``` ## Virtual time Using some utils in LangChain, you can mock out the time component. ```python from langchain.utils import mock_now import datetime ``` ```python # Notice the last access time is that date time with mock_now(datetime.datetime(2011, 2, 3, 10, 11)): print(retriever.get_relevant_documents(""hello world"")) ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'hello world\', metadata={\'last_accessed_at\': MockDateTime(2011, 2, 3, 10, 11), \'created_at\': datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 13, 21, 0, 27, 279596), \'buffer_idx\': 0})] ``` - [Low decay rate](#low-decay-rate) - [High decay rate](#high-decay-rate) - [Virtual time](#virtual-time)', 'Fleet AI Libraries Context | Fleet AI Libraries Context The Fleet AI team is on a mission to embed the world\'s most important data.

But, retrieval may produce different results with subtle changes in query wording or if the embeddings do not capture the semantics of the data well.

The `MultiQueryRetriever` automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents.

RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer: ``` We\'ll use the [LCEL Runnable]( protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box ```python from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python for chunk in rag_chain.stream(""What is Task Decomposition?""): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Task decomposition can be performed by AI models with prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ### Go deeper #### Choosing LLMs `ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model wrapper.

There are two main things we need to do to support this. 1. Add a messages placeholder to our chain which allows us to pass in historical messages 2.

A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch ``` ```python general_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a helpful assistant.

Router chains are made up of two components: - The `RouterChain` itself (responsible for selecting the next chain to call) - `destination_chains`: chains that the router chain can route to In this example, we will focus on the different types of routing chains. We will show these routing chains used in a `MultiPromptChain` to create a question-answering chain that selects the prompt which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using that prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.chains.router import MultiPromptChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` ### [Legacy] LLMRouterChain This chain uses an LLM to determine how to route things. ```python prompt_infos = [ { ""name"": ""physics"", ""description"": ""Good for answering questions about physics"", ""prompt_template"": physics_template, }, { ""name"": ""math"", ""description"": ""Good for answering math questions"", ""prompt_template"": math_template, }, ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() ``` ```python destination_chains = {} for p_info in prompt_infos: name = p_info[""name""] prompt_template = p_info[""prompt_template""] prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=[""input""]) chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) destination_chains[name] = chain default_chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, output_key=""text"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains.router.llm_router import LLMRouterChain, RouterOutputParser from langchain.chains.router.multi_prompt_prompt import MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE ``` ```python destinations = [f""{p[\'name\']}: {p[\'description\']}"" for p in prompt_infos] destinations_str = ""\\n"".join(destinations) router_template = MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE.format(destinations=destinations_str) router_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=router_template, input_variables=[""input""], output_parser=RouterOutputParser(), ) router_chain = LLMRouterChain.from_llm(llm, router_prompt) ``` ```python chain = MultiPromptChain( router_chain=router_chain, destination_chains=destination_chains, default_chain=default_chain, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is black body radiation?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is black body radiation?\'} > Finished chain. Black body radiation is the thermal electromagnetic radiation within or surrounding a body in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment, or emitted by a black body (an idealized physical body which absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation). It is a characteristic of the temperature of the body; if the body has a uniform temperature, the radiation is also uniform across the spectrum of frequencies. The spectral characteristics of the radiation are determined by the temperature of the body, which implies that a black body at a given temperature will emit the same amount of radiation at every frequency. ``` ```python print( chain.run( ""What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?"" ) ) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( math: {\'input\': \'What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?\'} > Finished chain. The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43. This can be seen by breaking down the problem: 1) We know that a prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and one. 2) We also know that if a number is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. So, if we want to find the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3, we can start counting up from 40, testing each number to see if it is prime and if the sum of the number and one is divisible by three. The first number we come to that satisfies these conditions is 43. ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?\'} > Finished chain.

However, delivering LLM applications to production can be deceptively difficult. You will likely have to heavily customize and iterate on your prompts, chains, and other components to create a high-quality product. To aid in this process, we\'ve launched LangSmith, a unified platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring your LLM applications. When might this come in handy? You may find it useful when you want to: - Quickly debug a new chain, agent, or set of tools - Visualize how components (chains, llms, retrievers, etc.) relate and are used - Evaluate different prompts and LLMs for a single component - Run a given chain several times over a dataset to ensure it consistently meets a quality bar - Capture usage traces and using LLMs or analytics pipelines to generate insights ## Prerequisites **Create a LangSmith account and create an API key (see bottom left corner). Familiarize yourself with the platform by looking through the docs** Note LangSmith is in closed beta; we\'re in the process of rolling it out to more users. However, you can fill out the form on the website for expedited access. Now, let\'s get started! ## Log runs to LangSmith First, configure your environment variables to tell LangChain to log traces. This is done by setting the `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2` environment variable to true. You can tell LangChain which project to log to by setting the `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT` environment variable (if this isn\'t set, runs will be logged to the `default` project). This will automatically create the project for you if it doesn\'t exist. You must also set the `LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT` and `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` environment variables. For more information on other ways to set up tracing, please reference the [LangSmith documentation]( **NOTE:** You must also set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables in order to run the following tutorial. **NOTE:** You can only access an API key when you first create it. Keep it somewhere safe. **NOTE:** You can also use a context manager in python to log traces using ```python from langchain.callbacks.manager import tracing_v2_enabled with tracing_v2_enabled(project_name=""My Project""): agent.run(""How many people live in canada as of 2023?"") ``` However, in this example, we will use environment variables. ```python %pip install openai tiktoken pandas duckduckgo-search --quiet ``` ```python import os from uuid import uuid4 unique_id = uuid4().hex[0:8] os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_PROJECT""] = f""Tracing Walkthrough - {unique_id}"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT""] = "" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = """" # Update to your API key # Used by the agent in this tutorial os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """" ``` Create the langsmith client to interact with the API ```python from langsmith import Client client = Client() ``` Create a LangChain component and log runs to the platform. In this example, we will create a ReAct-style agent with access to a general search tool (DuckDuckGo). The agent\'s prompt can be viewed in the [Hub here]( ```python from langchain import hub from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.agents.output_parsers import OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchResults from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function # Fetches the latest version of this prompt prompt = hub.pull(""wfh/langsmith-agent-prompt:latest"") llm = ChatOpenAI( model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"", temperature=0, ) tools = [ DuckDuckGoSearchResults( name=""duck_duck_go"" ), # General internet search using DuckDuckGo ] llm_with_tools = llm.bind(functions=[format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools]) runnable_agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) agent_executor = AgentExecutor( agent=runnable_agent, tools=tools, handle_parsing_errors=True ) ``` We are running the agent concurrently on multiple inputs to reduce latency. Runs get logged to LangSmith in the background so execution latency is unaffected. ```python inputs = [ ""What is LangChain?"", ""What\'s LangSmith?"", ""When was Llama-v2 released?"", ""What is the langsmith cookbook?"", ""When did langchain first announce the hub?"", ] results = agent_executor.batch([{""input"": x} for x in inputs], return_exceptions=True) ``` ```python results[:2] ``` ```text [{\'input\': \'What is LangChain?\', \'output\': \'I\\\'m sorry, but I couldn\\\'t find any information about ""LangChain"". Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?\'}, {\'input\': ""What\'s LangSmith?"", \'output\': \'I\\\'m sorry, but I couldn\\\'t find any information about ""LangSmith"". It could be a specific term or a company that is not widely known. Can you provide more context or clarify what you are referring to?\'}] ``` Assuming you\'ve successfully set up your environment, your agent traces should show up in the `Projects` section in the [app]( Congrats! ![Initial Runs](/assets/images/log_traces-edd14f0c4d5c320263362395793babdc.png) It looks like the agent isn\'t effectively using the tools though. Let\'s evaluate this so we have a baseline. ## Evaluate Agent In addition to logging runs, LangSmith also allows you to test and evaluate your LLM applications. In this section, you will leverage LangSmith to create a benchmark dataset and run AI-assisted evaluators on an agent. You will do so in a few steps: 1. Create a dataset 2. Initialize a new agent to benchmark 3. Configure evaluators to grade an agent\'s output 4. Run the agent over the dataset and evaluate the results ### 1. Create a LangSmith dataset Below, we use the LangSmith client to create a dataset from the input questions from above and a list labels. You will use these later to measure performance for a new agent. A dataset is a collection of examples, which are nothing more than input-output pairs you can use as test cases to your application. For more information on datasets, including how to create them from CSVs or other files or how to create them in the platform, please refer to the [LangSmith documentation]( ```python outputs = [ ""LangChain is an open-source framework for building applications using large language models. It is also the name of the company building LangSmith."", ""LangSmith is a unified platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring language model applications and agents powered by LangChain"", ""July 18, 2023"", ""The langsmith cookbook is a github repository containing detailed examples of how to use LangSmith to debug, evaluate, and monitor large language model-powered applications."", ""September 5, 2023"", ] ``` ```python dataset_name = f""agent-qa-{unique_id}"" dataset = client.create_dataset( dataset_name, description=""An example dataset of questions over the LangSmith documentation."", ) for query, answer in zip(inputs, outputs): client.create_example( inputs={""input"": query}, outputs={""output"": answer}, dataset_id=dataset.id ) ``` ### 2. Initialize a new agent to benchmark LangSmith lets you evaluate any LLM, chain, agent, or even a custom function. Conversational agents are stateful (they have memory); to ensure that this state isn\'t shared between dataset runs, we will pass in a `chain_factory` (aka a `constructor`) function to initialize for each call. In this case, we will test an agent that uses OpenAI\'s function calling endpoints. ```python from langchain import hub from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.agents.output_parsers import OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function # Since chains can be stateful (e.g. they can have memory), we provide # a way to initialize a new chain for each row in the dataset. This is done # by passing in a factory function that returns a new chain for each row. def agent_factory(prompt): llm_with_tools = llm.bind( functions=[format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools] ) runnable_agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) return AgentExecutor(agent=runnable_agent, tools=tools, handle_parsing_errors=True) ``` ### 3. Configure evaluation Manually comparing the results of chains in the UI is effective, but it can be time consuming. It can be helpful to use automated metrics and AI-assisted feedback to evaluate your component\'s performance. Below, we will create some pre-implemented run evaluators that do the following: - Compare results against ground truth labels. - Measure semantic (dis)similarity using embedding distance - Evaluate \'aspects\' of the agent\'s response in a reference-free manner using custom criteria For a longer discussion of how to select an appropriate evaluator for your use case and how to create your own custom evaluators, please refer to the [LangSmith documentation]( ```python from langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorType from langchain.smith import RunEvalConfig evaluation_config = RunEvalConfig( # Evaluators can either be an evaluator type (e.g., ""qa"", ""criteria"", ""embedding_distance"", etc.) or a configuration for that evaluator evaluators=[ # Measures whether a QA response is ""Correct"", based on a reference answer # You can also select via the raw string ""qa"" EvaluatorType.QA, # Measure the embedding distance between the output and the reference answer # Equivalent to: EvalConfig.EmbeddingDistance(embeddings=OpenAIEmbeddings()) EvaluatorType.EMBEDDING_DISTANCE, # Grade whether the output satisfies the stated criteria. # You can select a default one such as ""helpfulness"" or provide your own. RunEvalConfig.LabeledCriteria(""helpfulness""), # The LabeledScoreString evaluator outputs a score on a scale from 1-10. # You can use default criteria or write our own rubric RunEvalConfig.LabeledScoreString( { ""accuracy"": """""" Score 1: The answer is completely unrelated to the reference. Score 3: The answer has minor relevance but does not align with the reference. Score 5: The answer has moderate relevance but contains inaccuracies. Score 7: The answer aligns with the reference but has minor errors or omissions. Score 10: The answer is completely accurate and aligns perfectly with the reference."""""" }, normalize_by=10, ), ], # You can add custom StringEvaluator or RunEvaluator objects here as well, which will automatically be # applied to each prediction. Check out the docs for examples. custom_evaluators=[], ) ``` ### 4. Run the agent and evaluators Use the [run_on_dataset]( (or asynchronous [arun_on_dataset]( function to evaluate your model. This will: 1. Fetch example rows from the specified dataset. 2. Run your agent (or any custom function) on each example. 3. Apply evaluators to the resulting run traces and corresponding reference examples to generate automated feedback.

33,whats an agent type that works well with Anthropic's models and supports structured output?,"['Dynamically route logic based on input | Dynamically route logic based on input This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language. Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`. Do not respond with more than one word. {question} Classification:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I call Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text \' Anthropic\' ``` Now, let\'s create three sub chains: ```python langchain_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in langchain. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Harrison Chase told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) anthropic_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in anthropic. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Dario Amodei told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) general_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch branch = RunnableBranch( (lambda x: ""anthropic"" in x[""topic""].lower(), anthropic_chain), (lambda x: ""langchain"" in x[""topic""].lower(), langchain_chain), general_chain, ) ``` ```python full_chain = {""topic"": chain, ""question"": lambda x: x[""question""]} | branch ``` ```python full_chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I use Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content="" As Dario Amodei told me, here are some ways to use Anthropic:\\n\\n- Sign up for an account on Anthropic\'s website to access tools like Claude, Constitutional AI, and Writer. \\n\\n- Use Claude for tasks like email generation, customer service chat, and QA.

[Anthropic]( is an AI safety and research company, and is the creator of Claude. This page covers all integrations between Anthropic models and LangChain. ## Prompting Overview Claude is chat-based model, meaning it is trained on conversation data. However, it is a text based API, meaning it takes in single string. It expects this string to be in a particular format. This means that it is up the user to ensure that is the case. LangChain provides several utilities and helper functions to make sure prompts that you write - whether formatted as a string or as a list of messages - end up formatted correctly. Specifically, Claude is trained to fill in text for the Assistant role as part of an ongoing dialogue between a human user (`Human:`) and an AI assistant (`Assistant:`). Prompts sent via the API must contain `\\n\\nHuman:` and `\\n\\nAssistant:` as the signals of who\'s speaking. The final turn must always be `\\n\\nAssistant:` - the input string cannot have `\\n\\nHuman:` as the final role. Because Claude is chat-based but accepts a string as input, it can be treated as either a LangChain `ChatModel` or `LLM`. This means there are two wrappers in LangChain - `ChatAnthropic` and `Anthropic`. It is generally recommended to use the `ChatAnthropic` wrapper, and format your prompts as `ChatMessage`s (we will show examples of this below). This is because it keeps your prompt in a general format that you can easily then also use with other models (should you want to). However, if you want more fine-grained control over the prompt, you can use the `Anthropic` wrapper - we will show and example of this as well. The `Anthropic` wrapper however is deprecated, as all functionality can be achieved in a more generic way using `ChatAnthropic`. ## Prompting Best Practices Anthropic models have several prompting best practices compared to OpenAI models. **No System Messages** Anthropic models are not trained on the concept of a ""system message"". We have worked with the Anthropic team to handle them somewhat appropriately (a Human message with an `admin` tag) but this is largely a hack and it is recommended that you do not use system messages. **AI Messages Can Continue** A completion from Claude is a continuation of the last text in the string which allows you further control over Claude\'s output. For example, putting words in Claude\'s mouth in a prompt like this: `\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: What do you call a bear with no teeth?` This will return a completion like this `A gummy bear!` instead of a whole new assistant message with a different random bear joke. ## ChatAnthropic `ChatAnthropic` is a subclass of LangChain\'s `ChatModel`, meaning it works best with `ChatPromptTemplate`. You can import this wrapper with the following code: ```text from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic model = ChatAnthropic() ``` When working with ChatModels, it is preferred that you design your prompts as `ChatPromptTemplate`s. Here is an example below of doing that: ```text from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", ""You are a helpful chatbot""), (""human"", ""Tell me a joke about {topic}""), ]) ``` You can then use this in a chain as follows: ```text chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` How is the prompt actually being formatted under the hood? We can see that by running the following code ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nYou are a helpful chatbot\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that under the hood LangChain is not appending any prefix/suffix to `SystemMessage`\'s. This is because Anthropic has no concept of `SystemMessage`. Anthropic requires all prompts to end with assistant messages. This means if the last message is not an assistant message, the suffix `Assistant:` will automatically be inserted. If you decide instead to use a normal PromptTemplate (one that just works on a single string) let\'s take a look at what happens: ```text from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that it automatically adds the Human and Assistant tags. What is happening under the hood? First: the string gets converted to a single human message. This happens generically (because we are using a subclass of `ChatModel`). Then, similarly to the above example, an empty Assistant message is getting appended. This is Anthropic specific. ## [Deprecated] Anthropic This `Anthropic` wrapper is subclassed from `LLM`. We can import it with: ```text from langchain.llms import Anthropic model = Anthropic() ``` This model class is designed to work with normal PromptTemplates. An example of that is below: ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` Let\'s see what is going on with the prompt templating under the hood! ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs the following ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:\\n\' ``` Notice that it adds the Human tag at the start of the string, and then finishes it with `\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:`. The extra `Sure, here you go` was added on purpose by the Anthropic team. What happens if we have those symbols in the prompt directly? ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Human: Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\' ``` We can see that we detect that the user is trying to use the special tokens, and so we don\'t do any formatting. - [Prompting Overview](#prompting-overview) - [Prompting Best Practices](#prompting-best-practices) - [ChatAnthropic](#chatanthropic) - [Deprecated Anthropic](#deprecated-anthropic)']","An agent type that works well with Anthropic's models and supports structured output is the **XML Agent**. This type of agent can utilize XML to structure its output, which is particularly useful for parsing and processing the data in a well-defined format. 

Here's a brief example of how to set it up:

```python
from langchain.agents import tool

from langchain import hub
from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_xml
from langchain.agents.output_parsers import XMLAgentOutputParser

    """"""Search things about current events.""""""
    return ""32 degrees""

tools = [search]

prompt = hub.pull(""hwchase17/xml-agent"")
prompt = prompt.partial(tools=render_text_description(tools), tool_names="", "".join([t.name for t in tools]), )

    | prompt
    | llm_with_stop
    | XMLAgentOutputParser()
)

agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)

Requires momento to use, uncomment below to install: ```python # !pip install momento ``` You\'ll need to get a Momento auth token to use this class. This can either be passed in to a momento.CacheClient if you\'d like to instantiate that directly, as a named parameter `auth_token` to `MomentoChatMessageHistory.from_client_params`, or can just be set as an environment variable `MOMENTO_AUTH_TOKEN`. ```python from datetime import timedelta from langchain.cache import MomentoCache cache_name = ""langchain"" ttl = timedelta(days=1) set_llm_cache(MomentoCache.from_client_params(cache_name, ttl)) ``` ```python # The first time, it is not yet in cache, so it should take longer llm(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 40.7 ms, sys: 16.5 ms, total: 57.2 ms Wall time: 1.73 s \'\\n\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\n\\nTo get to the other side!\' ``` ```python # The second time it is, so it goes faster # When run in the same region as the cache, latencies are single digit ms llm(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 3.16 ms, sys: 2.98 ms, total: 6.14 ms Wall time: 57.9 ms \'\\n\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\n\\nTo get to the other side!\' ``` ## SQLAlchemy Cache You can use `SQLAlchemyCache` to cache with any SQL database supported by `SQLAlchemy`. ```python # from langchain.cache import SQLAlchemyCache # from sqlalchemy import create_engine # engine = create_engine(""postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"") # set_llm_cache(SQLAlchemyCache(engine)) ``` ### Custom SQLAlchemy Schemas ```python # You can define your own declarative SQLAlchemyCache child class to customize the schema used for caching. For example, to support high-speed fulltext prompt indexing with Postgres, use: from langchain.cache import SQLAlchemyCache from sqlalchemy import Column, Computed, Index, Integer, Sequence, String, create_engine from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base from sqlalchemy_utils import TSVectorType Base = declarative_base() class FulltextLLMCache(Base): # type: ignore """"""Postgres table for fulltext-indexed LLM Cache"""""" __tablename__ = ""llm_cache_fulltext"" id = Column(Integer, Sequence(""cache_id""), primary_key=True) prompt = Column(String, nullable=False) llm = Column(String, nullable=False) idx = Column(Integer) response = Column(String) prompt_tsv = Column( TSVectorType(), Computed(""to_tsvector(\'english\', llm || \' \' || prompt)"", persisted=True), ) __table_args__ = ( Index(""idx_fulltext_prompt_tsv"", prompt_tsv, postgresql_using=""gin""), ) engine = create_engine(""postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"") set_llm_cache(SQLAlchemyCache(engine, FulltextLLMCache)) ``` ## Cassandra caches You can use Cassandra / Astra DB for caching LLM responses, choosing from the exact-match `CassandraCache` or the (vector-similarity-based) `CassandraSemanticCache`. Let\'s see both in action in the following cells. #### Connect to the DB First you need to establish a `Session` to the DB and to specify a _keyspace_ for the cache table(s). The following gets you started with an Astra DB instance (see e.g. [here]( for more backends and connection options). ```python import getpass keyspace = input(""\\nKeyspace name? "") ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN = getpass.getpass(\'\\nAstra DB Token (""AstraCS:..."") \') ASTRA_DB_SECURE_BUNDLE_PATH = input(""Full path to your Secure Connect Bundle? "") ``` ```text Keyspace name? my_keyspace Astra DB Token (""AstraCS:..."") Full path to your Secure Connect Bundle? /path/to/secure-connect-databasename.zip ``` ```python from cassandra.auth import PlainTextAuthProvider from cassandra.cluster import Cluster cluster = Cluster( cloud={ ""secure_connect_bundle"": ASTRA_DB_SECURE_BUNDLE_PATH, }, auth_provider=PlainTextAuthProvider(""token"", ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN), ) session = cluster.connect() ``` ### Exact cache This will avoid invoking the LLM when the supplied prompt is _exactly_ the same as one encountered already: ```python from langchain.cache import CassandraCache from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache set_llm_cache(CassandraCache(session=session, keyspace=keyspace)) ``` ```python print(llm(""Why is the Moon always showing the same side?"")) ``` ```text The Moon always shows the same side because it is tidally locked to Earth. CPU times: user 41.7 ms, sys: 153 µs, total: 41.8 ms Wall time: 1.96 s ``` ```python print(llm(""Why is the Moon always showing the same side?"")) ``` ```text The Moon always shows the same side because it is tidally locked to Earth. CPU times: user 4.09 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 4.09 ms Wall time: 119 ms ``` ### Semantic cache\u200b This cache will do a semantic similarity search and return a hit if it finds a cached entry that is similar enough, For this, you need to provide an `Embeddings` instance of your choice. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ```python from langchain.cache import CassandraSemanticCache set_llm_cache( CassandraSemanticCache( session=session, keyspace=keyspace, embedding=embedding, table_name=""cass_sem_cache"", ) ) ``` ```python print(llm(""Why is the Moon always showing the same side?"")) ``` ```text The Moon always shows the same side because it is tidally locked with Earth. This means that the same side of the Moon always faces Earth. CPU times: user 21.3 ms, sys: 177 µs, total: 21.4 ms Wall time: 3.09 s ``` ```python print(llm(""How come we always see one face of the moon?"")) ``` ```text The Moon always shows the same side because it is tidally locked with Earth. This means that the same side of the Moon always faces Earth. CPU times: user 10.9 ms, sys: 17 µs, total: 10.9 ms Wall time: 461 ms ``` ## Optional Caching\u200b You can also turn off caching for specific LLMs should you choose. In the example below, even though global caching is enabled, we turn it off for a specific LLM ```python llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", n=2, best_of=2, cache=False) ``` ```python llm(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 5.8 ms, sys: 2.71 ms, total: 8.51 ms Wall time: 745 ms \'\\n\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\n\\nTo get to the other side!\' ``` ```python llm(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 4.91 ms, sys: 2.64 ms, total: 7.55 ms Wall time: 623 ms \'\\n\\nTwo guys stole a calendar. They got six months each.\' ``` ## Optional Caching in Chains\u200b You can also turn off caching for particular nodes in chains. Note that because of certain interfaces, its often easier to construct the chain first, and then edit the LLM afterwards. As an example, we will load a summarizer map-reduce chain. We will cache results for the map-step, but then not freeze it for the combine step. ```python llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"") no_cache_llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", cache=False) ``` ```python from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter() ``` ```python with open(""../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") as f: state_of_the_union = f.read() texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union) ``` ```python from langchain.docstore.document import Document docs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts[:3]] from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain ``` ```python chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"", reduce_llm=no_cache_llm) ``` ```python chain.run(docs) ``` ```text CPU times: user 452 ms, sys: 60.3 ms, total: 512 ms Wall time: 5.09 s \'\\n\\nPresident Biden is discussing the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will create jobs and help Americans.

Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America.

It doesn\\\'t matter what one\\\'s political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn\\\'t true. I\\\'ve seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don\\\'t exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we\\\'re treated to the site of Vincent Gallo\\\'s throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) ""double-standard"" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won\\\'t see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica.

I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York\\\'s portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He\\\'s small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS\\\' American Masters: Finding Lucy.

Certainly couldn\\\'t be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It\\\'s the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot\\x97 TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that\\\'s no fun to watch.Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character\\\'s status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I\\\'m-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat\\\'s-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple\\\'s respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich\\\'s daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on \\\'love\\\' while observing their parents.

It\\\'s a movie and we can expect that much, if that\\\'s what you\\\'re looking for you\\\'d be better off picking up a copy of Vogue.Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie\\\'s title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20\\\'s may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. ""They All Laughed"" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn\\\'t prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there\\\'s no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten\\\'s scenes. But ""Laughed"" is a faint echo of ""The Last Picture Show"", ""Paper Moon"" or ""What\\\'s Up, Doc""- following ""Daisy Miller"" and ""At Long Last Love"", it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which P.B. has never emerged.All in all, though, the movie is harmless, only a waste of rental.

You\'re supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming.

Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous.

Second, a `configurable_alternatives` method. With this method, you can list out alternatives for any particular runnable that can be set during runtime. ## Configuration Fields ### With LLMs With LLMs we can configure things like temperature ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0).configurable_fields( temperature=ConfigurableField( id=""llm_temperature"", name=""LLM Temperature"", description=""The temperature of the LLM"", ) ) ``` ```python model.invoke(""pick a random number"") ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'7\') ``` ```python model.with_config(configurable={""llm_temperature"": 0.9}).invoke(""pick a random number"") ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'34\') ``` We can also do this when its used as part of a chain ```python prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Pick a random number above {x}"") chain = prompt | model ``` ```python chain.invoke({""x"": 0}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'57\') ``` ```python chain.with_config(configurable={""llm_temperature"": 0.9}).invoke({""x"": 0}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'6\') ``` ### With HubRunnables This is useful to allow for switching of prompts ```python from langchain.runnables.hub import HubRunnable ``` ```python prompt = HubRunnable(""rlm/rag-prompt"").configurable_fields( owner_repo_commit=ConfigurableField( id=""hub_commit"", name=""Hub Commit"", description=""The Hub commit to pull from"", ) ) ``` ```python prompt.invoke({""question"": ""foo"", ""context"": ""bar""}) ``` ```text ChatPromptValue(messages=[HumanMessage(content=""You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

(please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved. I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now. It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue it\'s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables. My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\'ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use! I didn\'t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+.

Here's a simple example using the `ConfigurableField` and `configurable_alternatives` methods:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema.runnable import ConfigurableField

# Define the LLM with alternatives
llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0).configurable_alternatives(
    ConfigurableField(id=""llm"", 
                      default_key=""anthropic"", 
                      openai=ChatOpenAI(), 
                      gpt4=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"")
                     )
)

# Create a configured LLM object
configured_llm = llm.with_config(configurable={""llm"": ""openai""})

# Now you can use `configured_llm` as needed
```

In this example, `configured_llm` is an object that has been configured to use `ChatOpenAI` instead of the default `ChatAnthropic`. You can now use this configured LLM in your applications.

Remember to refer to the official documentation for the most up-to-date and detailed information on configuring LLMs.","To save the configuration for a given LLM, you can follow these steps:

First, let's go over loading an LLM configuration from disk. LLM configurations can be saved in two formats: JSON or YAML, but they are loaded in the same way.

For a JSON-formatted LLM configuration (llm.json):

```json
{
    ""model_name"": ""text-davinci-003"",
    ""temperature"": 0.7,
    ""max_tokens"": 256,
    ""top_p"": 1.0,
    ""frequency_penalty"": 0.0,
    ""presence_penalty"": 0.0,
    ""n"": 1,
    ""best_of"": 1,
    ""request_timeout"": null,
    ""_type"": ""openai""
}
```

Load the configuration like this:

```python
from langchain.llms.loading import load_llm

llm = load_llm(""llm.json"")
```

For a YAML-formatted LLM configuration (llm.yaml):

```yaml
_type: openai
best_of: 1
frequency_penalty: 0.0
max_tokens: 256
model_name: text-davinci-003
n: 1
presence_penalty: 0.0
request_timeout: null
temperature: 0.7
top_p: 1.0
```

Load the configuration like this:

```python
from langchain.llms.loading import load_llm

llm = load_llm(""llm.yaml"")
```

To save an LLM configuration from memory to a serialized version, you can use the `.save` method. This method supports both JSON and YAML formats:

```python
llm.save(""llm.json"")
llm.save(""llm.yaml"")
```

This way, you can easily save and load LLM configurations to and from disk.",0.99999999995,,,0.29436489775753666,0.22284122562674097

It allows you to store data objects and vector embeddings from your favorite ML models, and scale seamlessly into billions of data objects. In the notebook, we\'ll demo the `SelfQueryRetriever` wrapped around a `Weaviate` vector store. ## Creating a Weaviate vector store First we\'ll want to create a Weaviate vector store and seed it with some data. We\'ve created a small demo set of documents that contain summaries of movies. **Note:** The self-query retriever requires you to have `lark` installed (`pip install lark`). We also need the `weaviate-client` package. ```python #!pip install lark weaviate-client ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import Document from langchain.vectorstores import Weaviate embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ```python docs = [ Document( page_content=""A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose"", metadata={""year"": 1993, ""rating"": 7.7, ""genre"": ""science fiction""}, ), Document( page_content=""Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ..."", metadata={""year"": 2010, ""director"": ""Christopher Nolan"", ""rating"": 8.2}, ), Document( page_content=""A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea"", metadata={""year"": 2006, ""director"": ""Satoshi Kon"", ""rating"": 8.6}, ), Document( page_content=""A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them"", metadata={""year"": 2019, ""director"": ""Greta Gerwig"", ""rating"": 8.3}, ), Document( page_content=""Toys come alive and have a blast doing so"", metadata={""year"": 1995, ""genre"": ""animated""}, ), Document( page_content=""Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone"", metadata={ ""year"": 1979, ""director"": ""Andrei Tarkovsky"", ""genre"": ""science fiction"", ""rating"": 9.9, }, ), ] vectorstore = Weaviate.from_documents( docs, embeddings, weaviate_url="" ) ``` ## Creating our self-querying retriever Now we can instantiate our retriever. To do this we\'ll need to provide some information upfront about the metadata fields that our documents support and a short description of the document contents. ```python from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever metadata_field_info = [ AttributeInfo( name=""genre"", description=""The genre of the movie"", type=""string or list[string]"", ), AttributeInfo( name=""year"", description=""The year the movie was released"", type=""integer"", ), AttributeInfo( name=""director"", description=""The name of the movie director"", type=""string"", ), AttributeInfo( name=""rating"", description=""A 1-10 rating for the movie"", type=""float"" ), ] document_content_description = ""Brief summary of a movie"" llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm( llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True ) ``` ## Testing it out And now we can try actually using our retriever! ```python # This example only specifies a relevant query retriever.get_relevant_documents(""What are some movies about dinosaurs"") ``` ```text query=\'dinosaur\' filter=None limit=None [Document(page_content=\'A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose\', metadata={\'genre\': \'science fiction\', \'rating\': 7.7, \'year\': 1993}), Document(page_content=\'Toys come alive and have a blast doing so\', metadata={\'genre\': \'animated\', \'rating\': None, \'year\': 1995}), Document(page_content=\'Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone\', metadata={\'genre\': \'science fiction\', \'rating\': 9.9, \'year\': 1979}), Document(page_content=\'A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea\', metadata={\'genre\': None, \'rating\': 8.6, \'year\': 2006})] ``` ```python # This example specifies a query and a filter retriever.get_relevant_documents(""Has Greta Gerwig directed any movies about women"") ``` ```text query=\'women\' filter=Comparison(comparator=, attribute=\'director\', value=\'Greta Gerwig\') limit=None [Document(page_content=\'A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them\', metadata={\'genre\': None, \'rating\': 8.3, \'year\': 2019})] ``` ## Filter k We can also use the self query retriever to specify `k`: the number of documents to fetch. We can do this by passing `enable_limit=True` to the constructor. ```python retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm( llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, enable_limit=True, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python # This example only specifies a relevant query retriever.get_relevant_documents(""what are two movies about dinosaurs"") ``` ```text query=\'dinosaur\' filter=None limit=2 [Document(page_content=\'A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose\', metadata={\'genre\': \'science fiction\', \'rating\': 7.7, \'year\': 1993}), Document(page_content=\'Toys come alive and have a blast doing so\', metadata={\'genre\': \'animated\', \'rating\': None, \'year\': 1995})] ``` - [Creating a Weaviate vector store](#creating-a-weaviate-vector-store) - [Creating our self-querying retriever](#creating-our-self-querying-retriever) - [Testing it out](#testing-it-out) - [Filter k](#filter-k)']","Certainly! Here's an example of how to customize the `VectorStoreRetriever` to return the top 10 nearest neighbors using Weaviate:

```python
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.schema import Document
from langchain.vectorstores import Weaviate
from langchain.retrievers.vector_store import VectorStoreRetriever

# Initialize embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Sample documents
docs = [
    Document(page_content=""A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose"", metadata={""year"": 1993, ""rating"": 7.7, ""genre"": ""science fiction""}),
    Document(page_content=""Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a ..."", metadata={""year"": 2010, ""director"": ""Christopher Nolan"", ""rating"": 8.2}),
    Document(page_content=""A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea"", metadata={""year"": 2006, ""director"": ""Satoshi Kon"", ""rating"": 8.6}),
    Document(page_content=""A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them"", metadata={""year"": 2019, ""director"": ""Greta Gerwig"", ""rating"": 8.3}),
    Document(page_content=""Toys come alive and have a blast doing so"", metadata={""year"": 1995, ""genre"": ""animated""}),
    Document(page_content=""Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone"", metadata={""year"": 1979, ""director"": ""Andrei Tarkovsky"", ""genre"": ""science fiction"", ""rating"": 9.9}),
]

# Create Weaviate vector store
vectorstore = Weaviate.from_documents(docs, embeddings, weaviate_url=""your_weaviate_url_here"")

# Initialize VectorStoreRetriever with k=10
retriever = VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=vectorstore, k=10)

# Example query
query = ""What are some movies about dinosaurs""

# Retrieve top 10 nearest neighbors
results = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)

# Print results
for doc in results","To customize the Weaviate client and return the top 10 k nearest neighbors, you can utilize the `as_retriever` method with the appropriate parameters. Here's how you can achieve this:

```python
# Assuming you have imported the necessary modules and classes

# Create the Weaviate client
client = weaviate.Client(url=os.environ[""WEAVIATE_URL""], ...)

# Initialize the Weaviate wrapper
weaviate = Weaviate(client, index_name, text_key)

# Customize the client to return top 10 k nearest neighbors using as_retriever
custom_retriever = weaviate.as_retriever(
    search_type=""similarity"",
    search_kwargs={
        'k': 10  # Customize the value of k as needed
    }
)

# Now you can use the custom_retriever to perform searches
results = custom_retriever.search(query, ...)

RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer: ``` We\'ll use the [LCEL Runnable]( protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box ```python from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python for chunk in rag_chain.stream(""What is Task Decomposition?""): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Task decomposition can be performed by AI models with prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ### Go deeper #### Choosing LLMs `ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model wrapper.

Thanks for asking!\'} ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( Adding memory Suppose we want to create a stateful application that remembers past user inputs. There are two main things we need to do to support this. 1. Add a messages placeholder to our chain which allows us to pass in historical messages 2. Add a chain that takes the latest user query and reformulates it in the context of the chat history into a standalone question that can be passed to our retriever. Let\'s start with 2. We can build a ""condense question"" chain that looks something like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder condense_q_system_prompt = """"""Given a chat history and the latest user question \\ which might reference the chat history, formulate a standalone question \\ which can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \\ just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."""""" condense_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", condense_q_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) condense_q_chain = condense_q_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""What is meant by large"", } ) ``` ```text \'What is the definition of ""large"" in the context of a language model?\' ``` ```python condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""How do transformers work"", } ) ``` ```text \'How do transformer models function?\' ``` And now we can build our full QA chain. Notice we add some routing functionality to only run the ""condense question chain"" when our chat history isn\'t empty. ```python qa_system_prompt = """"""You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \\ Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. \\ If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. \\ Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\ {context}"""""" qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", qa_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) def condense_question(input: dict): if input.get(""chat_history""): return condense_q_chain else: return input[""question""] rag_chain = ( RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=condense_question | retriever | format_docs) | qa_prompt | llm ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] question = ""What is Task Decomposition?"" ai_msg = rag_chain.invoke({""question"": question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=question), ai_msg]) second_question = ""What are common ways of doing it?"" rag_chain.invoke({""question"": second_question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'Common ways of task decomposition include:\\n\\n1.

38,What is the difference between ChatPromptTemplate and PromptTemplate?,"['Prompt templates | Prompt templates Prompt templates are pre-defined recipes for generating prompts for language models. A template may include instructions, few-shot examples, and specific context and questions appropriate for a given task. LangChain provides tooling to create and work with prompt templates. LangChain strives to create model agnostic templates to make it easy to reuse existing templates across different language models. Typically, language models expect the prompt to either be a string or else a list of chat messages. ## PromptTemplate Use `PromptTemplate` to create a template for a string prompt. By default, `PromptTemplate` uses [Python\'s str.format]( syntax for templating. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."" ) prompt_template.format(adjective=""funny"", content=""chickens"") ``` ```text \'Tell me a funny joke about chickens.\' ``` The template supports any number of variables, including no variables: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke"") prompt_template.format() ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke\' ``` For additional validation, specify `input_variables` explicitly. These variables will be compared against the variables present in the template string during instantiation, **raising an exception if there is a mismatch**. For example: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate invalid_prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""adjective""], template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."", ) ``` ```text --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ValidationError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[19], line 3 1 from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ----> 3 invalid_prompt = PromptTemplate( 4 input_variables=[""adjective""], 5 template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."" 6 ) File ~/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/load/serializable.py:97, in Serializable.__init__(self, **kwargs) 96 def __init__(self, **kwargs: Any) -> None: ---> 97 super().__init__(**kwargs) 98 self._lc_kwargs = kwargs File ~/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pydantic/main.py:341, in pydantic.main.BaseModel.__init__() ValidationError: 1 validation error for PromptTemplate __root__ Invalid prompt schema; check for mismatched or missing input parameters. \'content\' (type=value_error) ``` You can create custom prompt templates that format the prompt in any way you want. For more information, see [Custom Prompt Templates](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/custom_prompt_template.html). ## ChatPromptTemplate The prompt to [chat models](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/models/chat) is a list of chat messages. Each chat message is associated with content, and an additional parameter called `role`. For example, in the OpenAI [Chat Completions API]( a chat message can be associated with an AI assistant, a human or a system role. Create a chat prompt template like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a helpful AI bot. Your name is {name}.""), (""human"", ""Hello, how are you doing?""), (""ai"", ""I\'m doing well, thanks!""), (""human"", ""{user_input}""), ] ) messages = chat_template.format_messages(name=""Bob"", user_input=""What is your name?"") ``` `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages` accepts a variety of message representations. For example, in addition to using the 2-tuple representation of (type, content) used above, you could pass in an instance of `MessagePromptTemplate` or `BaseMessage`. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import HumanMessagePromptTemplate from langchain.schema.messages import SystemMessage chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=( ""You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to "" ""sound more upbeat."" ) ), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{text}""), ] ) llm = ChatOpenAI() llm(chat_template.format_messages(text=""i dont like eating tasty things."")) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'I absolutely love indulging in delicious treats!\') ``` This provides you with a lot of flexibility in how you construct your chat prompts. ## LCEL `PromptTemplate` and `ChatPromptTemplate` implement the [Runnable interface](/docs/expression_language/interface), the basic building block of the [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/expression_language/). This means they support `invoke`, `ainvoke`, `stream`, `astream`, `batch`, `abatch`, `astream_log` calls. `PromptTemplate` accepts a dictionary (of the prompt variables) and returns a `StringPromptValue`. A `ChatPromptTemplate` accepts a dictionary and returns a `ChatPromptValue`. ```python prompt_val = prompt_template.invoke({""adjective"": ""funny"", ""content"": ""chickens""}) prompt_val ``` ```text StringPromptValue(text=\'Tell me a joke\') ``` ```python prompt_val.to_string() ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke\' ``` ```python prompt_val.to_messages() ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=\'Tell me a joke\')] ``` ```python chat_val = chat_template.invoke({""text"": ""i dont like eating tasty things.""}) ``` ```python chat_val.to_messages() ``` ```text [SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to sound more upbeat.""), HumanMessage(content=\'i dont like eating tasty things.\')] ``` ```python chat_val.to_string() ``` ```text ""System: You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to sound more upbeat.\\nHuman: i dont like eating tasty things."" ``` - [PromptTemplate](#prompttemplate) - [ChatPromptTemplate](#chatprompttemplate) - [LCEL](#lcel)', 'Baseten | Baseten [Baseten]( provides all the infrastructure you need to deploy and serve ML models performantly, scalably, and cost-efficiently. This example demonstrates using Langchain with models deployed on Baseten. # Setup To run this notebook, you\'ll need a [Baseten account]( and an [API key]( You\'ll also need to install the Baseten Python package: ```bash pip install baseten ``` ```python import baseten baseten.login(""YOUR_API_KEY"") ``` # Single model call First, you\'ll need to deploy a model to Baseten. You can deploy foundation models like WizardLM and Alpaca with one click from the [Baseten model library]( or if you have your own model, [deploy it with this tutorial]( In this example, we\'ll work with WizardLM. [Deploy WizardLM here]( and follow along with the deployed [model\'s version ID]( ```python from langchain.llms import Baseten ``` ```python # Load the model wizardlm = Baseten(model=""MODEL_VERSION_ID"", verbose=True) ``` ```python # Prompt the model wizardlm(""What is the difference between a Wizard and a Sorcerer?"") ``` # Chained model calls We can chain together multiple calls to one or multiple models, which is the whole point of Langchain! This example uses WizardLM to plan a meal with an entree, three sides, and an alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage pairing. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain, SimpleSequentialChain from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` ```python # Build the first link in the chain prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""cuisine""], template=""Name a complex entree for a {cuisine} dinner. Respond with just the name of a single dish."", ) link_one = LLMChain(llm=wizardlm, prompt=prompt) ``` ```python # Build the second link in the chain prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""entree""], template=""What are three sides that would go with {entree}. Respond with only a list of the sides."", ) link_two = LLMChain(llm=wizardlm, prompt=prompt) ``` ```python # Build the third link in the chain prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""sides""], template=""What is one alcoholic and one non-alcoholic beverage that would go well with this list of sides: {sides}. Respond with only the names of the beverages."", ) link_three = LLMChain(llm=wizardlm, prompt=prompt) ``` ```python # Run the full chain! menu_maker = SimpleSequentialChain( chains=[link_one, link_two, link_three], verbose=True ) menu_maker.run(""South Indian"") ```', 'Quickstart | Quickstart In this quickstart we\'ll show you how to: - Get setup with LangChain, LangSmith and LangServe - Use the most basic and common components of LangChain: prompt templates, models, and output parsers - Use LangChain Expression Language, the protocol that LangChain is built on and which facilitates component chaining - Build a simple application with LangChain - Trace your application with LangSmith - Serve your application with LangServe That\'s a fair amount to cover! Let\'s dive in. ## Setup ### Installation To install LangChain run: Pip ```bash pip install langchain ``` Conda ```bash conda install langchain -c conda-forge ``` For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/get_started/installation). ### Environment Using LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, APIs, etc. For this example, we\'ll use OpenAI\'s model APIs. First we\'ll need to install their Python package: ```bash pip install openai ``` Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading [here]( Once we have a key we\'ll want to set it as an environment variable by running: ```bash export OPENAI_API_KEY=""..."" ``` If you\'d prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the `openai_api_key` named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=""..."") ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```shell export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=""true"" export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=... ``` ### LangServe LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain chains as a REST API. You do not need to use LangServe to use LangChain, but in this guide we\'ll show how you can deploy your app with LangServe. Install with: ```bash pip install ""langserve[all]"" ``` ## Building with LangChain LangChain provides many modules that can be used to build language model applications. Modules can be used as standalones in simple applications and they can be composed for more complex use cases. Composition is powered by **LangChain Expression Language** (LCEL), which defines a unified `Runnable` interface that many modules implement, making it possible to seamlessly chain components. The simplest and most common chain contains three things: - LLM/Chat Model: The language model is the core reasoning engine here. In order to work with LangChain, you need to understand the different types of language models and how to work with them. - Prompt Template: This provides instructions to the language model. This controls what the language model outputs, so understanding how to construct prompts and different prompting strategies is crucial. - Output Parser: These translate the raw response from the language model to a more workable format, making it easy to use the output downstream. In this guide we\'ll cover those three components individually, and then go over how to combine them. Understanding these concepts will set you up well for being able to use and customize LangChain applications. Most LangChain applications allow you to configure the model and/or the prompt, so knowing how to take advantage of this will be a big enabler. ### LLM / Chat Model There are two types of language models: - `LLM`: underlying model takes a string as input and returns a string - `ChatModel`: underlying model takes a list of messages as input and returns a message Strings are simple, but what exactly are messages? The base message interface is defined by `BaseMessage`, which has two required attributes: - `content`: The content of the message. Usually a string. - `role`: The entity from which the `BaseMessage` is coming. LangChain provides several objects to easily distinguish between different roles: - `HumanMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from a human/user. - `AIMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from an AI/assistant. - `SystemMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from the system. - `FunctionMessage` / `ToolMessage`: A `BaseMessage` containing the output of a function or tool call. If none of those roles sound right, there is also a `ChatMessage` class where you can specify the role manually. LangChain provides a common interface that\'s shared by both `LLM`s and `ChatModel`s. However it\'s useful to understand the difference in order to most effectively construct prompts for a given language model. The simplest way to call an `LLM` or `ChatModel` is using `.invoke()`, the universal synchronous call method for all LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) objects: - `LLM.invoke`: Takes in a string, returns a string. - `ChatModel.invoke`: Takes in a list of `BaseMessage`, returns a `BaseMessage`. The input types for these methods are actually more general than this, but for simplicity here we can assume LLMs only take strings and Chat models only takes lists of messages. Check out the ""Go deeper"" section below to learn more about model invocation. Let\'s see how to work with these different types of models and these different types of inputs. First, let\'s import an LLM and a ChatModel. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = OpenAI() chat_model = ChatOpenAI() ``` `LLM` and `ChatModel` objects are effectively configuration objects. You can initialize them with parameters like `temperature` and others, and pass them around. ```python from langchain.schema import HumanMessage text = ""What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"" messages = [HumanMessage(content=text)] llm.invoke(text) # >> Feetful of Fun chat_model.invoke(messages) # >> AIMessage(content=""Socks O\'Color"") ``` Go deeper `LLM.invoke` and `ChatModel.invoke` actually both support as input any of `Union[str, List[BaseMessage], PromptValue]`. `PromptValue` is an object that defines it\'s own custom logic for returning it\'s inputs either as a string or as messages. `LLM`s have logic for coercing any of these into a string, and `ChatModel`s have logic for coercing any of these to messages. The fact that `LLM` and `ChatModel` accept the same inputs means that you can directly swap them for one another in most chains without breaking anything, though it\'s of course important to think about how inputs are being coerced and how that may affect model performance. To dive deeper on models head to the [Language models](/docs/modules/model_io/models) section. ### Prompt templates Most LLM applications do not pass user input directly into an LLM. Usually they will add the user input to a larger piece of text, called a prompt template, that provides additional context on the specific task at hand. In the previous example, the text we passed to the model contained instructions to generate a company name. For our application, it would be great if the user only had to provide the description of a company/product, without having to worry about giving the model instructions. PromptTemplates help with exactly this! They bundle up all the logic for going from user input into a fully formatted prompt. This can start off very simple - for example, a prompt to produce the above string would just be: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"") prompt.format(product=""colorful socks"") ``` ```python What is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks? ``` However, the advantages of using these over raw string formatting are several. You can ""partial"" out variables - e.g. you can format only some of the variables at a time. You can compose them together, easily combining different templates into a single prompt. For explanations of these functionalities, see the [section on prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts) for more detail. `PromptTemplate`s can also be used to produce a list of messages. In this case, the prompt not only contains information about the content, but also each message (its role, its position in the list, etc.). Here, what happens most often is a `ChatPromptTemplate` is a list of `ChatMessageTemplates`. Each `ChatMessageTemplate` contains instructions for how to format that `ChatMessage` - its role, and then also its content. Let\'s take a look at this below: ```python from langchain.prompts.chat import ChatPromptTemplate template = ""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}."" human_template = ""{text}"" chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", template), (""human"", human_template), ]) chat_prompt.format_messages(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."") ``` ```pycon [ SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."", additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming."") ] ``` ChatPromptTemplates can also be constructed in other ways - see the [section on prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts) for more detail. ### Output parsers `OutputParsers` convert the raw output of a language model into a format that can be used downstream. There are few main types of `OutputParser`s, including: - Convert text from `LLM` into structured information (e.g. JSON) - Convert a `ChatMessage` into just a string - Convert the extra information returned from a call besides the message (like OpenAI function invocation) into a string. For full information on this, see the [section on output parsers](/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers). In this getting started guide, we will write our own output parser - one that converts a comma separated list into a list. ```python from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""""" def parse(self, text: str): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call."""""" return text.strip().split("", "") CommaSeparatedListOutputParser().parse(""hi, bye"") # >> [\'hi\', \'bye\'] ``` ### Composing with LCEL We can now combine all these into one chain. This chain will take input variables, pass those to a prompt template to create a prompt, pass the prompt to a language model, and then pass the output through an (optional) output parser. This is a convenient way to bundle up a modular piece of logic. Let\'s see it in action! ```python from typing import List from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser[List[str]]): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""""" def parse(self, text: str) -> List[str]: """"""Parse the output of an LLM call."""""" return text.strip().split("", "") template = """"""You are a helpful assistant who generates comma separated lists. A user will pass in a category, and you should generate 5 objects in that category in a comma separated list. ONLY return a comma separated list, and nothing more."""""" human_template = ""{text}"" chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", template), (""human"", human_template), ]) chain = chat_prompt | ChatOpenAI() | CommaSeparatedListOutputParser() chain.invoke({""text"": ""colors""}) # >> [\'red\', \'blue\', \'green\', \'yellow\', \'orange\'] ``` Note that we are using the `|` syntax to join these components together. This `|` syntax is powered by the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and relies on the universal `Runnable` interface that all of these objects implement. To learn more about LCEL, read the documentation [here](/docs/expression_language). ## Tracing with LangSmith Assuming we\'ve set our environment variables as shown in the beginning, all of the model and chain calls we\'ve been making will have been automatically logged to LangSmith. Once there, we can use LangSmith to debug and annotate our application traces, then turn them into datasets for evaluating future iterations of the application. Check out what the trace for the above chain would look like: [ For more on LangSmith [head here](/docs/langsmith/). ## Serving with LangServe Now that we\'ve built an application, we need to serve it. That\'s where LangServe comes in. LangServe helps developers deploy LCEL chains as a REST API. The library is integrated with FastAPI and uses pydantic for data validation. ### Server To create a server for our application we\'ll make a `serve.py` file with three things: 1. The definition of our chain (same as above) 2. Our FastAPI app 3. A definition of a route from which to serve the chain, which is done with `langserve.add_routes` ```python #!/usr/bin/env python from typing import List from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser from langserve import add_routes # 1. Chain definition class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser[List[str]]): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""""" def parse(self, text: str) -> List[str]: """"""Parse the output of an LLM call."""""" return text.strip().split("", "") template = """"""You are a helpful assistant who generates comma separated lists. A user will pass in a category, and you should generate 5 objects in that category in a comma separated list. ONLY return a comma separated list, and nothing more."""""" human_template = ""{text}"" chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", template), (""human"", human_template), ]) category_chain = chat_prompt | ChatOpenAI() | CommaSeparatedListOutputParser() # 2. App definition app = FastAPI( title=""LangChain Server"", version=""1.0"", description=""A simple api server using Langchain\'s Runnable interfaces"", ) # 3. Adding chain route add_routes( app, category_chain, path=""/category_chain"", ) if __name__ == ""__main__"": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, host=""localhost"", port=8000) ``` And that\'s it! If we execute this file: ```bash python serve.py ``` we should see our chain being served at localhost:8000. ### Playground Every LangServe service comes with a simple built-in UI for configuring and invoking the application with streaming output and visibility into intermediate steps. Head to to try it out! ### Client Now let\'s set up a client for programmatically interacting with our service. We can easily do this with the `langserve.RemoteRunnable`. Using this, we can interact with the served chain as if it were running client-side. ```python from langserve import RemoteRunnable remote_chain = RemoteRunnable("" remote_chain.invoke({""text"": ""colors""}) # >> [\'red\', \'blue\', \'green\', \'yellow\', \'orange\'] ``` To learn more about the many other features of LangServe [head here](/docs/langserve). ## Next steps We\'ve touched on how to build an application with LangChain, how to trace it with LangSmith, and how to serve it with LangServe. There are a lot more features in all three of these than we can cover here.

The cons mentioned above can be mitigated or overcome with proper training, support, and a commitment to continuous improvement. It is also important to note that not all cons may be applicable to every organization or project.\\n\\nFor example, while Scrum may be complex initially, with proper training and guidance, teams can quickly grasp the concepts and practices. The lack of predictability can be mitigated by implementing techniques such as velocity tracking and release planning. The limited documentation can be addressed by maintaining a balance between lightweight documentation and clear communication among team members. The dependency on team collaboration can be improved through effective communication channels and regular team-building activities.\\n\\nScrum can be scaled and adapted to larger projects by using frameworks like Scrum of Scrums or LeSS (Large Scale Scrum). Concerns about speed versus quality can be addressed by incorporating quality assurance practices, such as continuous integration and automated testing, into the Scrum process. Scope creep can be managed by having a well-defined and prioritized product backlog, and a strong product owner can be developed through training and mentorship.\\n\\nResistance to change can be overcome by providing proper education and communication to stakeholders and involving them in the decision-making process. Ultimately, the cons of Scrum can be seen as opportunities for growth and improvement, and with the right mindset and support, they can be effectively managed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while Scrum may have its challenges and potential cons, the benefits and advantages it offers in terms of collaboration, flexibility, adaptability, transparency, and customer satisfaction make it a widely adopted and successful project management framework. With proper implementation and continuous improvement, organizations can leverage Scrum to drive innovation, efficiency, and project success.\' ``` - [Branching and Merging](#branching-and-merging)', 'langchain.schema.runnable.retry.RunnableRetry LangChain 0.0.337 API Experimental Python Docs Toggle Menu PrevUp Next LangChain 0.0.337 langchain.schema.runnable.retry.RunnableRetry langchain.schema.runnable.retry.RunnableRetry class langchain.schema.runnable.retry.RunnableRetry[source] Bases: RunnableBindingBase[Input, Output] Retry a Runnable if it fails. A RunnableRetry helps can be used to add retry logic to any object that subclasses the base Runnable. Such retries are especially useful for network calls that may fail due to transient errors. The RunnableRetry is implemented as a RunnableBinding. The easiest way to use it is through the .with_retry() method on all Runnables. Example: Here\'s an example that uses a RunnableLambda to raise an exception import time def foo(input) -> None: \'\'\'Fake function that raises an exception.\'\'\' raise ValueError(""Invoking foo failed. At time {time.time()}"") runnable = RunnableLambda(foo) runnable_with_retries = runnable.with_retry( retry_exception_types=(ValueError,), # Retry only on ValueError wait_exponential_jitter=True, # Add jitter to the exponential backoff max_attempt_number=2, # Try twice ) # The method invocation above is equivalent to the longer form below: runnable_with_retries = RunnableRetry( bound=runnable, retry_exception_types=(ValueError,), max_attempt_number=2, wait_exponential_jitter=True ) This logic can be used to retry any Runnable, including a chain of Runnables, but in general it\'s best practice to keep the scope of the retry as small as possible. For example, if you have a chain of Runnables, you should only retry the Runnable that is likely to fail, not the entire chain. Example from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate template = PromptTemplate.from_template(""tell me a joke about {topic}."") model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.5) # Good chain = template | model.with_retry() # Bad chain = template | model retryable_chain = chain.with_retry() Create a new model by parsing and validating input data from keyword arguments. Raises ValidationError if the input data cannot be parsed to form a valid model. param bound: Runnable[Input, Output] [Required] param config: RunnableConfig [Optional] param config_factories: List[Callable[[RunnableConfig], RunnableConfig]] [Optional] param custom_input_type: Optional[Any] = None param custom_output_type: Optional[Any] = None param kwargs: Mapping[str, Any] [Optional] param max_attempt_number: int = 3 The maximum number of attempts to retry the runnable. param retry_exception_types: Tuple[Type[BaseException], ...] = (,) The exception types to retry on.

41,What is html2texttransformer? Does it omit urls?,"['Web scraping | Web scraping []( ## Use case [Web research]( is one of the killer LLM applications: - Users have [highlighted it]( as one of his top desired AI tools. - OSS repos like [gpt-researcher]( are growing in popularity. ![Image description](/assets/images/web_scraping-001e2279b9e46c696012ac26d7f218a2.png) ## Overview Gathering content from the web has a few components: - `Search`: Query to url (e.g., using `GoogleSearchAPIWrapper`). - `Loading`: Url to HTML (e.g., using `AsyncHtmlLoader`, `AsyncChromiumLoader`, etc). - `Transforming`: HTML to formatted text (e.g., using `HTML2Text` or `Beautiful Soup`). ## Quickstart ```python pip install -q openai langchain playwright beautifulsoup4 playwright install # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` Scraping HTML content using a headless instance of Chromium. - The async nature of the scraping process is handled using Python\'s asyncio library. - The actual interaction with the web pages is handled by Playwright. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import AsyncChromiumLoader from langchain.document_transformers import BeautifulSoupTransformer # Load HTML loader = AsyncChromiumLoader(["" html = loader.load() ``` Scrape text content tags such as `, , , and ` tags from the HTML content: - ``: The paragraph tag. It defines a paragraph in HTML and is used to group together related sentences and/or phrases. - ``: The list item tag. It is used within ordered (``) and unordered (``) lists to define individual items within the list. - ``: The division tag. It is a block-level element used to group other inline or block-level elements. - ``: The anchor tag. It is used to define hyperlinks. - ``: an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. For many news websites (e.g., WSJ, CNN), headlines and summaries are all in `` tags. ```python # Transform bs_transformer = BeautifulSoupTransformer() docs_transformed = bs_transformer.transform_documents(html, tags_to_extract=[""span""]) ``` ```python # Result docs_transformed[0].page_content[0:500] ``` ```text \'English EditionEnglish (Chinese) (Japanese) More Other Products from WSJBuy Side from WSJWSJ ShopWSJ Wine Other Products from WSJ Search Quotes and Companies Search Quotes and Companies 0.15% 0.03% 0.12% -0.42% 4.102% -0.69% -0.25% -0.15% -1.82% 0.24% 0.19% -1.10% About Evan His Family Reflects His Reporting How You Can Help Write a Message Life in Detention Latest News Get Email Updates Four Americans Released From Iranian Prison The Americans will remain under house arrest until they are \' ``` These `Documents` now are staged for downstream usage in various LLM apps, as discussed below. ## Loader ### AsyncHtmlLoader The [AsyncHtmlLoader](/docs/use_cases/docs/integrations/document_loaders/async_html) uses the `aiohttp` library to make asynchronous HTTP requests, suitable for simpler and lightweight scraping. ### AsyncChromiumLoader The [AsyncChromiumLoader](/docs/use_cases/docs/integrations/document_loaders/async_chromium) uses Playwright to launch a Chromium instance, which can handle JavaScript rendering and more complex web interactions. Chromium is one of the browsers supported by Playwright, a library used to control browser automation. Headless mode means that the browser is running without a graphical user interface, which is commonly used for web scraping. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import AsyncHtmlLoader urls = ["" "" loader = AsyncHtmlLoader(urls) docs = loader.load() ``` ## Transformer ### HTML2Text [HTML2Text](/docs/use_cases/docs/integrations/document_transformers/html2text) provides a straightforward conversion of HTML content into plain text (with markdown-like formatting) without any specific tag manipulation. It\'s best suited for scenarios where the goal is to extract human-readable text without needing to manipulate specific HTML elements. ### Beautiful Soup Beautiful Soup offers more fine-grained control over HTML content, enabling specific tag extraction, removal, and content cleaning. It\'s suited for cases where you want to extract specific information and clean up the HTML content according to your needs. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import AsyncHtmlLoader urls = ["" "" loader = AsyncHtmlLoader(urls) docs = loader.load() ``` ```text Fetching pages: 100%|#############################################################################################################| 2/2 [00:00<00:00, 7.01it/s] ``` ```python from langchain.document_transformers import Html2TextTransformer html2text = Html2TextTransformer() docs_transformed = html2text.transform_documents(docs) docs_transformed[0].page_content[0:500] ``` ```text ""Skip to main content Skip to navigation\\n\\n\\n\\nMenu\\n\\n## ESPN\\n\\n * Search\\n\\n * * scores\\n\\n * NFL\\n * MLB\\n * NBA\\n * NHL\\n * Soccer\\n * NCAAF\\n * \\n\\n * Women\'s World Cup\\n * LLWS\\n * NCAAM\\n * NCAAW\\n * Sports Betting\\n * Boxing\\n * CFL\\n * NCAA\\n * Cricket\\n * F1\\n * Golf\\n * Horse\\n * MMA\\n * NASCAR\\n * NBA G League\\n * Olympic Sports\\n * PLL\\n * Racing\\n * RN BB\\n * RN FB\\n * Rugby\\n * Tennis\\n * WNBA\\n * WWE\\n * X Games\\n * XFL\\n\\n * More"" ``` ## Scraping with extraction ### LLM with function calling Web scraping is challenging for many reasons. One of them is the changing nature of modern websites\' layouts and content, which requires modifying scraping scripts to accommodate the changes. Using Function (e.g., OpenAI) with an extraction chain, we avoid having to change your code constantly when websites change. We\'re using `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` to guarantee access to OpenAI Functions feature (although this might be available to everyone by time of writing). We\'re also keeping `temperature` at `0` to keep randomness of the LLM down. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"") ``` ### Define a schema Next, you define a schema to specify what kind of data you want to extract. Here, the key names matter as they tell the LLM what kind of information they want. So, be as detailed as possible. In this example, we want to scrape only news article\'s name and summary from The Wall Street Journal website. ```python from langchain.chains import create_extraction_chain schema = { ""properties"": { ""news_article_title"": {""type"": ""string""}, ""news_article_summary"": {""type"": ""string""}, }, ""required"": [""news_article_title"", ""news_article_summary""], } def extract(content: str, schema: dict): return create_extraction_chain(schema=schema, llm=llm).run(content) ``` ### Run the web scraper w/ BeautifulSoup As shown above, we\'ll be using `BeautifulSoupTransformer`. ```python import pprint from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter def scrape_with_playwright(urls, schema): loader = AsyncChromiumLoader(urls) docs = loader.load() bs_transformer = BeautifulSoupTransformer() docs_transformed = bs_transformer.transform_documents( docs, tags_to_extract=[""span""] ) print(""Extracting content with LLM"") # Grab the first 1000 tokens of the site splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0 ) splits = splitter.split_documents(docs_transformed) # Process the first split extracted_content = extract(schema=schema, content=splits[0].page_content) pprint.pprint(extracted_content) return extracted_content urls = ["" extracted_content = scrape_with_playwright(urls, schema=schema) ``` ```text

In the example below, we will deeply crawl the Python documentation of LangChain\'s Chat LLM models and answer a question over it. First, install the requirements `pip install apify-client openai langchain chromadb tiktoken` Next, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `APIFY_API_TOKEN` in your environment variables. The full code follows: ```python from langchain.docstore.document import Document from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator from langchain.utilities import ApifyWrapper apify = ApifyWrapper() # Call the Actor to obtain text from the crawled webpages loader = apify.call_actor( actor_id=""apify/website-content-crawler"", run_input={ ""startUrls"": [{""url"": "" }, dataset_mapping_function=lambda item: Document( page_content=item[""text""] or """", metadata={""source"": item[""url""]} ), ) # Create a vector store based on the crawled data index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader]) # Query the vector store query = ""Are any OpenAI chat models integrated in LangChain?"" result = index.query(query) print(result) ``` ```text Yes, LangChain offers integration with OpenAI chat models.

42,I want to return the source documents of my Weaviate retriever. Show me how,"['Weaviate | Weaviate [Weaviate]( is an open-source vector database. It allows you to store data objects and vector embeddings from your favorite ML models, and scale seamlessly into billions of data objects. In the notebook, we\'ll demo the `SelfQueryRetriever` wrapped around a `Weaviate` vector store. ## Creating a Weaviate vector store First we\'ll want to create a Weaviate vector store and seed it with some data. We\'ve created a small demo set of documents that contain summaries of movies. **Note:** The self-query retriever requires you to have `lark` installed (`pip install lark`). We also need the `weaviate-client` package. ```python #!pip install lark weaviate-client ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import Document from langchain.vectorstores import Weaviate embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ```python docs = [ Document( page_content=""A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose"", metadata={""year"": 1993, ""rating"": 7.7, ""genre"": ""science fiction""}, ), Document( page_content=""Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ..."", metadata={""year"": 2010, ""director"": ""Christopher Nolan"", ""rating"": 8.2}, ), Document( page_content=""A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea"", metadata={""year"": 2006, ""director"": ""Satoshi Kon"", ""rating"": 8.6}, ), Document( page_content=""A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them"", metadata={""year"": 2019, ""director"": ""Greta Gerwig"", ""rating"": 8.3}, ), Document( page_content=""Toys come alive and have a blast doing so"", metadata={""year"": 1995, ""genre"": ""animated""}, ), Document( page_content=""Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone"", metadata={ ""year"": 1979, ""director"": ""Andrei Tarkovsky"", ""genre"": ""science fiction"", ""rating"": 9.9, }, ), ] vectorstore = Weaviate.from_documents( docs, embeddings, weaviate_url="" ) ``` ## Creating our self-querying retriever Now we can instantiate our retriever. To do this we\'ll need to provide some information upfront about the metadata fields that our documents support and a short description of the document contents. ```python from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever metadata_field_info = [ AttributeInfo( name=""genre"", description=""The genre of the movie"", type=""string or list[string]"", ), AttributeInfo( name=""year"", description=""The year the movie was released"", type=""integer"", ), AttributeInfo( name=""director"", description=""The name of the movie director"", type=""string"", ), AttributeInfo( name=""rating"", description=""A 1-10 rating for the movie"", type=""float"" ), ] document_content_description = ""Brief summary of a movie"" llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm( llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True ) ``` ## Testing it out And now we can try actually using our retriever! ```python # This example only specifies a relevant query retriever.get_relevant_documents(""What are some movies about dinosaurs"") ``` ```text query=\'dinosaur\' filter=None limit=None [Document(page_content=\'A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose\', metadata={\'genre\': \'science fiction\', \'rating\': 7.7, \'year\': 1993}), Document(page_content=\'Toys come alive and have a blast doing so\', metadata={\'genre\': \'animated\', \'rating\': None, \'year\': 1995}), Document(page_content=\'Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone\', metadata={\'genre\': \'science fiction\', \'rating\': 9.9, \'year\': 1979}), Document(page_content=\'A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea\', metadata={\'genre\': None, \'rating\': 8.6, \'year\': 2006})] ``` ```python # This example specifies a query and a filter retriever.get_relevant_documents(""Has Greta Gerwig directed any movies about women"") ``` ```text query=\'women\' filter=Comparison(comparator=, attribute=\'director\', value=\'Greta Gerwig\') limit=None [Document(page_content=\'A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them\', metadata={\'genre\': None, \'rating\': 8.3, \'year\': 2019})] ``` ## Filter k We can also use the self query retriever to specify `k`: the number of documents to fetch. We can do this by passing `enable_limit=True` to the constructor. ```python retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm( llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, enable_limit=True, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python # This example only specifies a relevant query retriever.get_relevant_documents(""what are two movies about dinosaurs"") ``` ```text query=\'dinosaur\' filter=None limit=2 [Document(page_content=\'A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose\', metadata={\'genre\': \'science fiction\', \'rating\': 7.7, \'year\': 1993}), Document(page_content=\'Toys come alive and have a blast doing so\', metadata={\'genre\': \'animated\', \'rating\': None, \'year\': 1995})] ``` - [Creating a Weaviate vector store](#creating-a-weaviate-vector-store) - [Creating our self-querying retriever](#creating-our-self-querying-retriever) - [Testing it out](#testing-it-out) - [Filter k](#filter-k)', ""langchain.retrievers.weaviate_hybrid_search.WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever LangChain 0.0.337 API Experimental Python Docs Toggle Menu PrevUp Next LangChain 0.0.337 langchain.retrievers.weaviate_hybrid_search.WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever langchain.retrievers.weaviate_hybrid_search.WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever class langchain.retrievers.weaviate_hybrid_search.WeaviateHybridSearchRetriever[source] Bases: BaseRetriever Weaviate hybrid search retriever.

Returns A pydantic model that can be used to validate output. get_relevant_documents(query: str, *, callbacks: Callbacks = None, tags: Optional[List[str]] = None, metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None, run_name: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs: Any) → List[Document]¶ Retrieve documents relevant to a query. :param query: string to find relevant documents for :param callbacks: Callback manager or list of callbacks :param tags: Optional list of tags associated with the retriever. Defaults to None These tags will be associated with each call to this retriever, and passed as arguments to the handlers defined in callbacks. Parameters metadata – Optional metadata associated with the retriever. Defaults to None This metadata will be associated with each call to this retriever, and passed as arguments to the handlers defined in callbacks. Returns List of relevant documents invoke(input: str, config: Optional[RunnableConfig] = None) → List[Document]¶ Transform a single input into an output. Override to implement. Parameters input – The input to the runnable. config – A config to use when invoking the runnable. The config supports standard keys like 'tags', 'metadata' for tracing purposes, 'max_concurrency' for controlling how much work to do in parallel, and other keys. Please refer to the RunnableConfig for more details. Returns The output of the runnable. classmethod is_lc_serializable() → bool¶ Is this class serializable? json(*, include: Optional[Union[AbstractSetIntStr, MappingIntStrAny]] = None, exclude: Optional[Union[AbstractSetIntStr, MappingIntStrAny]] = None, by_alias: bool = False, skip_defaults: Optional[bool] = None, exclude_unset: bool = False, exclude_defaults: bool = False, exclude_none: bool = False, encoder: Optional[Callable[[Any], Any]] = None, models_as_dict: bool = True, **dumps_kwargs: Any) → unicode¶ Generate a JSON representation of the model, include and exclude arguments as per dict(). encoder is an optional function to supply as default to json.dumps(), other arguments as per json.dumps(). classmethod lc_id() → List[str]¶ A unique identifier for this class for serialization purposes. The unique identifier is a list of strings that describes the path to the object. map() → Runnable[List[Input], List[Output]]¶ Return a new Runnable that maps a list of inputs to a list of outputs, by calling invoke() with each input. classmethod parse_file(path: Union[str, Path], *, content_type: unicode = None, encoding: unicode = 'utf8', proto: Protocol = None, allow_pickle: bool = False) → Model¶ classmethod parse_obj(obj: Any) → Model¶ classmethod parse_raw(b: Union[str, bytes], *, content_type: unicode = None, encoding: unicode = 'utf8', proto: Protocol = None, allow_pickle: bool = False) → Model¶ classmethod schema(by_alias: bool = True, ref_template: unicode = '#/definitions/{model}') → DictStrAny¶ classmethod schema_json(*, by_alias: bool = True, ref_template: unicode = '#/definitions/{model}', **dumps_kwargs: Any) → unicode¶ stream(input: Input, config: Optional[RunnableConfig] = None, **kwargs: Optional[Any]) → Iterator[Output]¶ Default implementation of stream, which calls invoke. Subclasses should override this method if they support streaming output. to_json() → Union[SerializedConstructor, SerializedNotImplemented]¶ to_json_not_implemented() → SerializedNotImplemented¶ transform(input: Iterator[Input], config: Optional[RunnableConfig] = None, **kwargs: Optional[Any]) → Iterator[Output]¶ Default implementation of transform, which buffers input and then calls stream. Subclasses should override this method if they can start producing output while input is still being generated. classmethod update_forward_refs(**localns: Any) → None¶ Try to update ForwardRefs on fields based on this Model, globalns and localns. classmethod validate(value: Any) → Model¶ with_config(config: Optional[RunnableConfig] = None, **kwargs: Any) → Runnable[Input, Output]¶ Bind config to a Runnable, returning a new Runnable. with_fallbacks(fallbacks: Sequence[Runnable[Input, Output]], *, exceptions_to_handle: Tuple[Type[BaseException], ...] = (,)) → RunnableWithFallbacksT[Input, Output]¶ Add fallbacks to a runnable, returning a new Runnable.

Show this page source"", 'DocArray | DocArray [DocArray]( is a versatile, open-source tool for managing your multi-modal data. It lets you shape your data however you want, and offers the flexibility to store and search it using various document index backends. Plus, it gets even better - you can utilize your `DocArray` document index to create a `DocArrayRetriever`, and build awesome Langchain apps! This notebook is split into two sections. The [first section](#document-index-backends) offers an introduction to all five supported document index backends. It provides guidance on setting up and indexing each backend and also instructs you on how to build a `DocArrayRetriever` for finding relevant documents. In the [second section](#movie-retrieval-using-hnswdocumentindex), we\'ll select one of these backends and illustrate how to use it through a basic example. ## Document Index Backends ```python import random from docarray import BaseDoc from docarray.typing import NdArray from langchain.embeddings import FakeEmbeddings from langchain.retrievers import DocArrayRetriever embeddings = FakeEmbeddings(size=32) ``` Before you start building the index, it\'s important to define your document schema. This determines what fields your documents will have and what type of data each field will hold. For this demonstration, we\'ll create a somewhat random schema containing \'title\' (str), \'title_embedding\' (numpy array), \'year\' (int), and \'color\' (str) ```python class MyDoc(BaseDoc): title: str title_embedding: NdArray[32] year: int color: str ``` ### InMemoryExactNNIndex `InMemoryExactNNIndex` stores all Documents in memory. It is a great starting point for small datasets, where you may not want to launch a database server. Learn more here: [ ```python from docarray.index import InMemoryExactNNIndex # initialize the index db = InMemoryExactNNIndex[MyDoc]() # index data db.index( [ MyDoc( title=f""My document {i}"", title_embedding=embeddings.embed_query(f""query {i}""), year=i, color=random.choice([""red"", ""green"", ""blue""]), ) for i in range(100) ] ) # optionally, you can create a filter query filter_query = {""year"": {""$lte"": 90}} ``` ```python # create a retriever retriever = DocArrayRetriever( index=db, embeddings=embeddings, search_field=""title_embedding"", content_field=""title"", filters=filter_query, ) # find the relevant document doc = retriever.get_relevant_documents(""some query"") print(doc) ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'My document 56\', metadata={\'id\': \'1f33e58b6468ab722f3786b96b20afe6\', \'year\': 56, \'color\': \'red\'})] ``` ### HnswDocumentIndex `HnswDocumentIndex` is a lightweight Document Index implementation that runs fully locally and is best suited for small- to medium-sized datasets. It stores vectors on disk in [hnswlib]( and stores all other data in [SQLite]( Learn more here: [ ```python from docarray.index import HnswDocumentIndex # initialize the index db = HnswDocumentIndex[MyDoc](work_dir=""hnsw_index"") # index data db.index( [ MyDoc( title=f""My document {i}"", title_embedding=embeddings.embed_query(f""query {i}""), year=i, color=random.choice([""red"", ""green"", ""blue""]), ) for i in range(100) ] ) # optionally, you can create a filter query filter_query = {""year"": {""$lte"": 90}} ``` ```python # create a retriever retriever = DocArrayRetriever( index=db, embeddings=embeddings, search_field=""title_embedding"", content_field=""title"", filters=filter_query, ) # find the relevant document doc = retriever.get_relevant_documents(""some query"") print(doc) ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'My document 28\', metadata={\'id\': \'ca9f3f4268eec7c97a7d6e77f541cb82\', \'year\': 28, \'color\': \'red\'})] ``` ### WeaviateDocumentIndex `WeaviateDocumentIndex` is a document index that is built upon [Weaviate]( vector database. Learn more here: [ ```python # There\'s a small difference with the Weaviate backend compared to the others. # Here, you need to \'mark\' the field used for vector search with \'is_embedding=True\'. # So, let\'s create a new schema for Weaviate that takes care of this requirement. from pydantic import Field class WeaviateDoc(BaseDoc): title: str title_embedding: NdArray[32] = Field(is_embedding=True) year: int color: str ``` ```python from docarray.index import WeaviateDocumentIndex # initialize the index dbconfig = WeaviateDocumentIndex.DBConfig(host="" db = WeaviateDocumentIndex[WeaviateDoc](db_config=dbconfig) # index data db.index( [ MyDoc( title=f""My document {i}"", title_embedding=embeddings.embed_query(f""query {i}""), year=i, color=random.choice([""red"", ""green"", ""blue""]), ) for i in range(100) ] ) # optionally, you can create a filter query filter_query = {""path"": [""year""], ""operator"": ""LessThanEqual"", ""valueInt"": ""90""} ``` ```python # create a retriever retriever = DocArrayRetriever( index=db, embeddings=embeddings, search_field=""title_embedding"", content_field=""title"", filters=filter_query, ) # find the relevant document doc = retriever.get_relevant_documents(""some query"") print(doc) ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'My document 17\', metadata={\'id\': \'3a5b76e85f0d0a01785dc8f9d965ce40\', \'year\': 17, \'color\': \'red\'})] ``` ### ElasticDocIndex `ElasticDocIndex` is a document index that is built upon [ElasticSearch]( Learn more [here]( ```python from docarray.index import ElasticDocIndex # initialize the index db = ElasticDocIndex[MyDoc]( hosts="" index_name=""docarray_retriever"" ) # index data db.index( [ MyDoc( title=f""My document {i}"", title_embedding=embeddings.embed_query(f""query {i}""), year=i, color=random.choice([""red"", ""green"", ""blue""]), ) for i in range(100) ] ) # optionally, you can create a filter query filter_query = {""range"": {""year"": {""lte"": 90}}} ``` ```python # create a retriever retriever = DocArrayRetriever( index=db, embeddings=embeddings, search_field=""title_embedding"", content_field=""title"", filters=filter_query, ) # find the relevant document doc = retriever.get_relevant_documents(""some query"") print(doc) ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'My document 46\', metadata={\'id\': \'edbc721bac1c2ad323414ad1301528a4\', \'year\': 46, \'color\': \'green\'})] ``` ### QdrantDocumentIndex `QdrantDocumentIndex` is a document index that is built upon [Qdrant]( vector database Learn more [here]( ```python from docarray.index import QdrantDocumentIndex from qdrant_client.http import models as rest # initialize the index qdrant_config = QdrantDocumentIndex.DBConfig(path="":memory:"") db = QdrantDocumentIndex[MyDoc](qdrant_config) # index data db.index( [ MyDoc( title=f""My document {i}"", title_embedding=embeddings.embed_query(f""query {i}""), year=i, color=random.choice([""red"", ""green"", ""blue""]), ) for i in range(100) ] ) # optionally, you can create a filter query filter_query = rest.Filter( must=[ rest.FieldCondition( key=""year"", range=rest.Range( gte=10, lt=90, ), ) ] ) ``` ```text WARNING:root:Payload indexes have no effect in the local Qdrant.

However, this time the database uses the CQL protocol, which means you\'ll use a _different_ class this time and instantiate it in another way. The cells below show how you should get your `vstore` object in this case and how you can clean up the database resources at the end: for the rest, i.e. the actual usage of the vector store, you will be able to run the very code that was shown above. In other words, running this demo in full with Cassandra or Astra DB through CQL means: - **initialization as shown below** - ""Load a dataset"", _see above section_ - ""Run simple searches"", _see above section_ - ""MMR search"", _see above section_ - ""Deleting stored documents"", _see above section_ - ""A minimal RAG chain"", _see above section_ - **cleanup as shown below** ### Initialization The class to use is the following: ```python from langchain.vectorstores import Cassandra ``` Now, depending on whether you connect to a Cassandra cluster or to Astra DB through CQL, you will provide different parameters when creating the vector store object. #### Initialization (Cassandra cluster) In this case, you first need to create a `cassandra.cluster.Session` object, as described in the [Cassandra driver documentation]( The details vary (e.g. with network settings and authentication), but this might be something like: ```python from cassandra.cluster import Cluster cluster = Cluster([""127.0.0.1""]) session = cluster.connect() ``` You can now set the session, along with your desired keyspace name, as a global CassIO parameter: ```python import cassio CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE = input(""CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE = "") cassio.init(session=session, keyspace=CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE) ``` Now you can create the vector store: ```python vstore = Cassandra( embedding=embe, table_name=""cassandra_vector_demo"", # session=None, keyspace=None # Uncomment on older versions of LangChain ) ``` #### Initialization (Astra DB through CQL) In this case you initialize CassIO with the following connection parameters: - the Database ID, e.g. `01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef` - the Token, e.g. `AstraCS:6gBhNmsk135....` (it must be a ""Database Administrator"" token) - Optionally a Keyspace name (if omitted, the default one for the database will be used) ```python ASTRA_DB_ID = input(""ASTRA_DB_ID = "") ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN = getpass(""ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN = "") desired_keyspace = input(""ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE (optional, can be left empty) = "") if desired_keyspace: ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE = desired_keyspace else: ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE = None ``` ```python import cassio cassio.init( database_id=ASTRA_DB_ID, token=ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN, keyspace=ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE, ) ``` Now you can create the vector store: ```python vstore = Cassandra( embedding=embe, table_name=""cassandra_vector_demo"", # session=None, keyspace=None # Uncomment on older versions of LangChain ) ``` ### Usage of the vector store _See the sections ""Load a dataset"" through ""A minimal RAG chain"" above._ Speaking of the latter, you can check out a full RAG template for Astra DB through CQL [here]( ### Cleanup the following essentially retrieves the `Session` object from CassIO and runs a CQL `DROP TABLE` statement with it: ```python cassio.config.resolve_session().execute( f""DROP TABLE {cassio.config.resolve_keyspace()}.cassandra_vector_demo;"" ) ``` ### Learn more For more information, extended quickstarts and additional usage examples, please visit the [CassIO documentation]( for more on using the LangChain `Cassandra` vector store. - [Setup and general dependencies](#setup-and-general-dependencies) - [Astra DB](#astra-db-1)- [Astra DB connection parameters](#astra-db-connection-parameters) - [Load a dataset](#load-a-dataset) - [Run simple searches](#run-simple-searches) - [MMR (Maximal-marginal-relevance) search](#mmr-maximal-marginal-relevance-search) - [Deleting stored documents](#deleting-stored-documents) - [A minimal RAG chain](#a-minimal-rag-chain) - [Cleanup](#cleanup) - [Apache Cassandra and Astra DB through CQL](#apache-cassandra-and-astra-db-through-cql)- [Initialization](#initialization) - [Usage of the vector store](#usage-of-the-vector-store) - [Cleanup](#cleanup-1) - [Learn more](#learn-more)', 'RAG with Timescale Vector using hybrid search | RAG with Timescale Vector using hybrid search This template shows how to use timescale-vector with the self-query retriver to perform hybrid search on similarity and time. This is useful any time your data has a strong time-based component. Some examples of such data are: - News articles (politics, business, etc) - Blog posts, documentation or other published material (public or private). - Social media posts - Changelogs of any kind - Messages Such items are often searched by both similarity and time. For example: Show me all news about Toyota trucks from 2022. [Timescale Vector]( provides superior performance when searching for embeddings within a particular timeframe by leveraging automatic table partitioning to isolate data for particular time-ranges. Langchain\'s self-query retriever allows deducing time-ranges (as well as other search criteria) from the text of user queries. ## What is Timescale Vector? **Timescale Vector is PostgreSQL++ for AI applications.** Timescale Vector enables you to efficiently store and query billions of vector embeddings in `PostgreSQL`. - Enhances `pgvector` with faster and more accurate similarity search on 1B+ vectors via DiskANN inspired indexing algorithm. - Enables fast time-based vector search via automatic time-based partitioning and indexing. - Provides a familiar SQL interface for querying vector embeddings and relational data. Timescale Vector is cloud PostgreSQL for AI that scales with you from POC to production: - Simplifies operations by enabling you to store relational metadata, vector embeddings, and time-series data in a single database. - Benefits from rock-solid PostgreSQL foundation with enterprise-grade feature liked streaming backups and replication, high-availability and row-level security. - Enables a worry-free experience with enterprise-grade security and compliance. ### How to access Timescale Vector Timescale Vector is available on [Timescale]( the cloud PostgreSQL platform.

RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer: ``` We\'ll use the [LCEL Runnable]( protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box ```python from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python for chunk in rag_chain.stream(""What is Task Decomposition?""): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Task decomposition can be performed by AI models with prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ### Go deeper #### Choosing LLMs `ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model wrapper.

There are two main things we need to do to support this. 1. Add a messages placeholder to our chain which allows us to pass in historical messages 2. Add a chain that takes the latest user query and reformulates it in the context of the chat history into a standalone question that can be passed to our retriever. Let\'s start with 2. We can build a ""condense question"" chain that looks something like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder condense_q_system_prompt = """"""Given a chat history and the latest user question \\ which might reference the chat history, formulate a standalone question \\ which can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \\ just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."""""" condense_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", condense_q_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) condense_q_chain = condense_q_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""What is meant by large"", } ) ``` ```text \'What is the definition of ""large"" in the context of a language model?\' ``` ```python condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""How do transformers work"", } ) ``` ```text \'How do transformer models function?\' ``` And now we can build our full QA chain.

LLMs - either with each other or with other components. LangChain provides two high-level frameworks for ""chaining"" components. The legacy approach is to use the `Chain` interface. The updated approach is to use the [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/expression_language/). When building new applications we recommend using LCEL for chain composition. But there are a number of useful, built-in `Chain`\'s that we continue to support, so we document both frameworks here. As we\'ll touch on below, `Chain`\'s can also themselves be used in LCEL, so the two are not mutually exclusive. ## LCEL The most visible part of LCEL is that it provides an intuitive and readable syntax for composition. But more importantly, it also provides first-class support for: - [streaming](/docs/expression_language/interface#stream), - [async calls](/docs/expression_language/interface#async-stream), - [batching](/docs/expression_language/interface#batch), - [parallelization](/docs/expression_language/interface#parallelism), - retries, - [fallbacks](/docs/expression_language/how_to/fallbacks), - tracing, - [and more.](/docs/expression_language/why) As a simple and common example, we can see what it\'s like to combine a prompt, model and output parser: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser model = ChatAnthropic() prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a very knowledgeable historian who provides accurate and eloquent answers to historical questions."", ), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) runnable = prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python for chunk in runnable.stream({""question"": ""How did Mansa Musa accumulate his wealth?""}): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Mansa Musa was the emperor of the Mali Empire in West Africa during the 14th century. He accumulated immense wealth through several means: - Gold mining - Mali contained very rich gold deposits, especially in the region of Bambuk. Gold mining and gold trade was a major source of wealth for the empire. - Control of trade routes - Mali dominated the trans-Saharan trade routes connecting West Africa to North Africa and beyond. By taxing the goods that passed through its territory, Mali profited greatly. - Tributary states - Many lands surrounding Mali paid tribute to the empire. This came in the form of gold, slaves, and other valuable resources. - Agriculture - Mali also had extensive agricultural lands irrigated by the Niger River. Surplus food produced could be sold or traded. - Royal monopolies - The emperor claimed monopoly rights over the production and sale of certain goods like salt from the Taghaza mines. This added to his personal wealth. - Inheritance - As an emperor, Mansa Musa inherited a wealthy state. His predecessors had already consolidated lands and accumulated riches which fell to Musa. So in summary, mining, trade, taxes, ``` For more head to the [LCEL section](/docs/expression_language/). ## [Legacy] Chain interface **Chain**\'s are the legacy interface for ""chained"" applications. We define a Chain very generically as a sequence of calls to components, which can include other chains. The base interface is simple: ```python class Chain(BaseModel, ABC): """"""Base interface that all chains should implement."""""" memory: BaseMemory callbacks: Callbacks def __call__( self, inputs: Any, return_only_outputs: bool = False, callbacks: Callbacks = None, ) -> Dict[str, Any]: ... ``` We can recreate the LCEL runnable we made above using the built-in `LLMChain`: ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=prompt, output_parser=StrOutputParser()) chain.run(question=""How did Mansa Musa accumulate his wealth?"") ``` ```text "" Mansa Musa was the emperor of the Mali Empire in West Africa in the early 14th century. He accumulated his vast wealth through several means:\\n\\n- Gold mining - Mali contained very rich gold deposits, especially in the southern part of the empire. Gold mining and trade was a major source of wealth.\\n\\n- Control of trade routes - Mali dominated the trans-Saharan trade routes connecting West Africa to North Africa and beyond. By taxing and controlling this lucrative trade, Mansa Musa reaped great riches.\\n\\n- Tributes from conquered lands - The Mali Empire expanded significantly under Mansa Musa\'s rule. As new lands were conquered, they paid tribute to the mansa in the form of gold, salt, and slaves.\\n\\n- Inheritance - Mansa Musa inherited a wealthy empire from his predecessor. He continued to build the wealth of Mali through the factors above.\\n\\n- Sound fiscal management - Musa is considered to have managed the empire and its finances very effectively, including keeping taxes reasonable and promoting a robust economy. This allowed him to accumulate and maintain wealth.\\n\\nSo in summary, conquest, trade, taxes, mining, and inheritance all contributed to Mansa Musa growing the M"" ``` For more specifics check out: - [How-to](/docs/modules/chains/how_to/) for walkthroughs of different chain features - [Foundational](/docs/modules/chains/foundational/) to get acquainted with core building block chains - [Document](/docs/modules/chains/document/) to learn how to incorporate documents into chains - [LCEL](#lcel) - [Legacy Chain interface](#legacy-chain-interface)', 'SpaCy | SpaCy [spaCy]( is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing, written in the programming languages Python and Cython. ## Installation and Setup ```python #!pip install spacy ``` Import the necessary classes ```python from langchain.embeddings.spacy_embeddings import SpacyEmbeddings ``` ## Example Initialize SpacyEmbeddings.This will load the Spacy model into memory. ```python embedder = SpacyEmbeddings() ``` Define some example texts . These could be any documents that you want to analyze - for example, news articles, social media posts, or product reviews. ```python texts = [ ""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."", ""Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs."", ""How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!"", ""Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack."", ] ``` Generate and print embeddings for the texts . The SpacyEmbeddings class generates an embedding for each document, which is a numerical representation of the document\'s content. These embeddings can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as document similarity comparison or text classification. ```python embeddings = embedder.embed_documents(texts) for i, embedding in enumerate(embeddings): print(f""Embedding for document {i+1}: {embedding}"") ``` Generate and print an embedding for a single piece of text. You can also generate an embedding for a single piece of text, such as a search query. This can be useful for tasks like information retrieval, where you want to find documents that are similar to a given query. ```python query = ""Quick foxes and lazy dogs."" query_embedding = embedder.embed_query(query) print(f""Embedding for query: {query_embedding}"") ``` - [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) - [Example](#example)']","LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is a feature of the LangChain framework, which is primarily designed for use with Python. As of now, LCEL does not have direct support for Java. If you're looking to use similar capabilities in Java, you might need to explore other frameworks or libraries that offer comparable functionality for building complex workflows or chains of operations.

For Java, you might consider using libraries such as Apache Beam, Spring Batch, or even custom implementations using Java's built-in features for handling complex workflows and data processing tasks. These tools can help you create parallel, streaming, and batch processing capabilities similar to what LCEL offers in Python.

Show this page source', 'Vespa | Vespa [Vespa]( is a fully featured search engine and vector database. It supports vector search (ANN), lexical search, and search in structured data, all in the same query. This notebook shows how to use `Vespa.ai` as a LangChain vector store. In order to create the vector store, we use [pyvespa]( to create a connection a `Vespa` service. ```python #!pip install pyvespa ``` Using the `pyvespa` package, you can either connect to a [Vespa Cloud instance]( or a local [Docker instance]( Here, we will create a new Vespa application and deploy that using Docker. #### Creating a Vespa application First, we need to create an application package: ```python from vespa.package import ApplicationPackage, Field, RankProfile app_package = ApplicationPackage(name=""testapp"") app_package.schema.add_fields( Field( name=""text"", type=""string"", indexing=[""index"", ""summary""], index=""enable-bm25"" ), Field( name=""embedding"", type=""tensor(x[384])"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""], attribute=[""distance-metric: angular""], ), ) app_package.schema.add_rank_profile( RankProfile( name=""default"", first_phase=""closeness(field, embedding)"", inputs=[(""query(query_embedding)"", ""tensor(x[384])"")], ) ) ``` This sets up a Vespa application with a schema for each document that contains two fields: `text` for holding the document text and `embedding` for holding the embedding vector. The `text` field is set up to use a BM25 index for efficient text retrieval, and we\'ll see how to use this and hybrid search a bit later. The `embedding` field is set up with a vector of length 384 to hold the embedding representation of the text. See [Vespa\'s Tensor Guide]( for more on tensors in Vespa. Lastly, we add a [rank profile]( to instruct Vespa how to order documents. Here we set this up with a [nearest neighbor search]( Now we can deploy this application locally: ```python from vespa.deployment import VespaDocker vespa_docker = VespaDocker() vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) ``` This deploys and creates a connection to a `Vespa` service. In case you already have a Vespa application running, for instance in the cloud, please refer to the PyVespa application for how to connect. #### Creating a Vespa vector store Now, let\'s load some documents: ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter loader = TextLoader(""../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) from langchain.embeddings.sentence_transformer import SentenceTransformerEmbeddings embedding_function = SentenceTransformerEmbeddings(model_name=""all-MiniLM-L6-v2"") ``` Here, we also set up local sentence embedder to transform the text to embedding vectors. One could also use OpenAI embeddings, but the vector length needs to be updated to `1536` to reflect the larger size of that embedding. To feed these to Vespa, we need to configure how the vector store should map to fields in the Vespa application. Then we create the vector store directly from this set of documents: ```python vespa_config = dict( page_content_field=""text"", embedding_field=""embedding"", input_field=""query_embedding"", ) from langchain.vectorstores import VespaStore db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) ``` This creates a Vespa vector store and feeds that set of documents to Vespa. The vector store takes care of calling the embedding function for each document and inserts them into the database. We can now query the vector store: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query) print(results[0].page_content) ``` This will use the embedding function given above to create a representation for the query and use that to search Vespa. Note that this will use the `default` ranking function, which we set up in the application package above. You can use the `ranking` argument to `similarity_search` to specify which ranking function to use. Please refer to the [pyvespa documentation]( for more information. This covers the basic usage of the Vespa store in LangChain. Now you can return the results and continue using these in LangChain. #### Updating documents An alternative to calling `from_documents`, you can create the vector store directly and call `add_texts` from that. This can also be used to update documents: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query) result = results[0] result.page_content = ""UPDATED: "" + result.page_content db.add_texts([result.page_content], [result.metadata], result.metadata[""id""]) results = db.similarity_search(query) print(results[0].page_content) ``` However, the `pyvespa` library contains methods to manipulate content on Vespa which you can use directly. #### Deleting documents You can delete documents using the `delete` function: ```python result = db.similarity_search(query) # docs[0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" db.delete([""32""]) result = db.similarity_search(query) # docs[0].metadata[""id""] != ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" ``` Again, the `pyvespa` connection contains methods to delete documents as well. ### Returning with scores The `similarity_search` method only returns the documents in order of relevancy. To retrieve the actual scores: ```python results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query) result = results[0] # result[1] ~= 0.463 ``` This is a result of using the `""all-MiniLM-L6-v2""` embedding model using the cosine distance function (as given by the argument `angular` in the application function). Different embedding functions need different distance functions, and Vespa needs to know which distance function to use when orderings documents. Please refer to the [documentation on distance functions]( for more information. ### As retriever To use this vector store as a [LangChain retriever]( simply call the `as_retriever` function, which is a standard vector store method: ```python db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) retriever = db.as_retriever() query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) # results[0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" ``` This allows for more general, unstructured, retrieval from the vector store. ### Metadata In the example so far, we\'ve only used the text and the embedding for that text. Documents usually contain additional information, which in LangChain is referred to as metadata. Vespa can contain many fields with different types by adding them to the application package: ```python app_package.schema.add_fields( # ... Field(name=""date"", type=""string"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""]), Field(name=""rating"", type=""int"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""]), Field(name=""author"", type=""string"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""]), # ... ) vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) ``` We can add some metadata fields in the documents: ```python # Add metadata for i, doc in enumerate(docs): doc.metadata[""date""] = f""2023-{(i % 12)+1}-{(i % 28)+1}"" doc.metadata[""rating""] = range(1, 6)[i % 5] doc.metadata[""author""] = [""Joe Biden"", ""Unknown""][min(i, 1)] ``` And let the Vespa vector store know about these fields: ```python vespa_config.update(dict(metadata_fields=[""date"", ""rating"", ""author""])) ``` Now, when searching for these documents, these fields will be returned. Also, these fields can be filtered on: ```python db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query, filter=""rating > 3"") # results[0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::34"" # results[0].metadata[""author""] == ""Unknown"" ``` ### Custom query If the default behavior of the similarity search does not fit your requirements, you can always provide your own query. Thus, you don\'t need to provide all of the configuration to the vector store, but rather just write this yourself. First, let\'s add a BM25 ranking function to our application: ```python from vespa.package import FieldSet app_package.schema.add_field_set(FieldSet(name=""default"", fields=[""text""])) app_package.schema.add_rank_profile(RankProfile(name=""bm25"", first_phase=""bm25(text)"")) vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) ``` Then, to perform a regular text search based on BM25: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" custom_query = { ""yql"": ""select * from sources * where userQuery()"", ""query"": query, ""type"": ""weakAnd"", ""ranking"": ""bm25"", ""hits"": 4, } results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query, custom_query=custom_query) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" # results[0][1] ~= 14.384 ``` All of the powerful search and query capabilities of Vespa can be used by using a custom query. Please refer to the Vespa documentation on it\'s [Query API]( for more details. ### Hybrid search Hybrid search means using both a classic term-based search such as BM25 and a vector search and combining the results. We need to create a new rank profile for hybrid search on Vespa: ```python app_package.schema.add_rank_profile( RankProfile( name=""hybrid"", first_phase=""log(bm25(text)) + 0.5 * closeness(field, embedding)"", inputs=[(""query(query_embedding)"", ""tensor(x[384])"")], ) ) vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) ``` Here, we score each document as a combination of it\'s BM25 score and its distance score. We can query using a custom query: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" query_embedding = embedding_function.embed_query(query) nearest_neighbor_expression = ( ""{targetHits: 4}nearestNeighbor(embedding, query_embedding)"" ) custom_query = { ""yql"": f""select * from sources * where {nearest_neighbor_expression} and userQuery()"", ""query"": query, ""type"": ""weakAnd"", ""input.query(query_embedding)"": query_embedding, ""ranking"": ""hybrid"", ""hits"": 4, } results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query, custom_query=custom_query) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""], ""id:testapp:testapp::32"") # results[0][1] ~= 2.897 ``` ### Native embedders in Vespa Up until this point we\'ve used an embedding function in Python to provide embeddings for the texts. Vespa supports embedding function natively, so you can defer this calculation in to Vespa. One benefit is the ability to use GPUs when embedding documents if you have a large collections. Please refer to [Vespa embeddings]( for more information. First, we need to modify our application package: ```python from vespa.package import Component, Parameter app_package.components = [ Component( id=""hf-embedder"", type=""hugging-face-embedder"", parameters=[ Parameter(""transformer-model"", {""path"": ""...""}), Parameter(""tokenizer-model"", {""url"": ""...""}), ], ) ] Field( name=""hfembedding"", type=""tensor(x[384])"", is_document_field=False, indexing=[""input text"", ""embed hf-embedder"", ""attribute"", ""summary""], attribute=[""distance-metric: angular""], ) app_package.schema.add_rank_profile( RankProfile( name=""hf_similarity"", first_phase=""closeness(field, hfembedding)"", inputs=[(""query(query_embedding)"", ""tensor(x[384])"")], ) ) ``` Please refer to the embeddings documentation on adding embedder models and tokenizers to the application. Note that the `hfembedding` field includes instructions for embedding using the `hf-embedder`. Now we can query with a custom query: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" nearest_neighbor_expression = ( ""{targetHits: 4}nearestNeighbor(internalembedding, query_embedding)"" ) custom_query = { ""yql"": f""select * from sources * where {nearest_neighbor_expression}"", ""input.query(query_embedding)"": f\'embed(hf-embedder, ""{query}"")\', ""ranking"": ""internal_similarity"", ""hits"": 4, } results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query, custom_query=custom_query) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""], ""id:testapp:testapp::32"") # results[0][1] ~= 0.630 ``` Note that the query here includes an `embed` instruction to embed the query using the same model as for the documents. ### Approximate nearest neighbor In all of the above examples, we\'ve used exact nearest neighbor to find results. However, for large collections of documents this is not feasible as one has to scan through all documents to find the best matches. To avoid this, we can use [approximate nearest neighbors]( First, we can change the embedding field to create a HNSW index: ```python from vespa.package import HNSW app_package.schema.add_fields( Field( name=""embedding"", type=""tensor(x[384])"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary"", ""index""], ann=HNSW( distance_metric=""angular"", max_links_per_node=16, neighbors_to_explore_at_insert=200, ), ) ) ``` This creates a HNSW index on the embedding data which allows for efficient searching. With this set, we can easily search using ANN by setting the `approximate` argument to `True`: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query, approximate=True) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""], ""id:testapp:testapp::32"") ``` This covers most of the functionality in the Vespa vector store in LangChain. - [Returning with scores](#returning-with-scores) - [As retriever](#as-retriever) - [Metadata](#metadata) - [Custom query](#custom-query) - [Hybrid search](#hybrid-search) - [Native embedders in Vespa](#native-embedders-in-vespa) - [Approximate nearest neighbor](#approximate-nearest-neighbor)', 'Redis | Redis Redis vector database introduction and langchain integration guide. ## What is Redis? Most developers from a web services background are probably familiar with Redis. At it\'s core, Redis is an open-source key-value store that can be used as a cache, message broker, and database. Developers choose Redis because it is fast, has a large ecosystem of client libraries, and has been deployed by major enterprises for years. On top of these traditional use cases, Redis provides additional capabilities like the Search and Query capability that allows users to create secondary index structures within Redis. This allows Redis to be a Vector Database, at the speed of a cache. ## Redis as a Vector Database Redis uses compressed, inverted indexes for fast indexing with a low memory footprint. It also supports a number of advanced features such as: - Indexing of multiple fields in Redis hashes and JSON - Vector similarity search (with HNSW (ANN) or FLAT (KNN)) - Vector Range Search (e.g. find all vectors within a radius of a query vector) - Incremental indexing without performance loss - Document ranking (using [tf-idf]( with optional user-provided weights) - Field weighting - Complex boolean queries with AND, OR, and NOT operators - Prefix matching, fuzzy matching, and exact-phrase queries - Support for [double-metaphone phonetic matching]( - Auto-complete suggestions (with fuzzy prefix suggestions) - Stemming-based query expansion in [many languages]( (using [Snowball]( - Support for Chinese-language tokenization and querying (using [Friso]( - Numeric filters and ranges - Geospatial searches using [Redis geospatial indexing](/commands/georadius) - A powerful aggregations engine - Supports for all utf-8 encoded text - Retrieve full documents, selected fields, or only the document IDs - Sorting results (for example, by creation date) ## Clients Since redis is much more than just a vector database, there are often use cases that demand usage of a Redis client besides just the langchain integration. You can use any standard Redis client library to run Search and Query commands, but it\'s easiest to use a library that wraps the Search and Query API. Below are a few examples, but you can find more client libraries [here]( | Project | Language | License | Author | Stars | | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | | jedis | Java | MIT | Redis | | | redisvl | Python | MIT | Redis | | | redis-py | Python | MIT | Redis | | | node-redis | Node.js | MIT | Redis | | | nredisstack | .NET | MIT | Redis | | ## Deployment Options There are many ways to deploy Redis with RediSearch. The easiest way to get started is to use Docker, but there are are many potential options for deployment such as - [Redis Cloud]( - [Docker (Redis Stack)]( - Cloud marketplaces: [AWS Marketplace]( [Google Marketplace]( or [Azure Marketplace]( - On-premise: [Redis Enterprise Software]( - Kubernetes: [Redis Enterprise Software on Kubernetes]( ## Examples Many examples can be found in the [Redis AI team\'s GitHub]( - [Awesome Redis AI Resources]( - List of examples of using Redis in AI workloads - [Azure OpenAI Embeddings Q&A]( - OpenAI and Redis as a Q&A service on Azure. - [ArXiv Paper Search]( - Semantic search over arXiv scholarly papers - [Vector Search on Azure]( - Vector search on Azure using Azure Cache for Redis and Azure OpenAI ## More Resources For more information on how to use Redis as a vector database, check out the following resources: - [RedisVL Documentation]( - Documentation for the Redis Vector Library Client - [Redis Vector Similarity Docs]( - Redis official docs for Vector Search. - [Redis-py Search Docs]( - Documentation for redis-py client library - [Vector Similarity Search: From Basics to Production]( - Introductory blog post to VSS and Redis as a VectorDB. ## Install Redis Python Client Redis-py is the officially supported client by Redis. Recently released is the RedisVL client which is purpose-built for the Vector Database use cases. Both can be installed with pip. ```bash pip install redis redisvl openai tiktoken ``` We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ## Sample Data First we will describe some sample data so that the various attributes of the Redis vector store can be demonstrated. ```python metadata = [ { ""user"": ""john"", ""age"": 18, ""job"": ""engineer"", ""credit_score"": ""high"", }, { ""user"": ""derrick"", ""age"": 45, ""job"": ""doctor"", ""credit_score"": ""low"", }, { ""user"": ""nancy"", ""age"": 94, ""job"": ""doctor"", ""credit_score"": ""high"", }, { ""user"": ""tyler"", ""age"": 100, ""job"": ""engineer"", ""credit_score"": ""high"", }, { ""user"": ""joe"", ""age"": 35, ""job"": ""dentist"", ""credit_score"": ""medium"", }, ] texts = [""foo"", ""foo"", ""foo"", ""bar"", ""bar""] ``` ## Initializing Redis To locally deploy Redis, run: ```console docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest ``` If things are running correctly you should see a nice Redis UI at See the [Deployment Options](#deployment-options) section above for other ways to deploy. The Redis VectorStore instance can be initialized in a number of ways. There are multiple class methods that can be used to initialize a Redis VectorStore instance. - `Redis.__init__` - Initialize directly - `Redis.from_documents` - Initialize from a list of `Langchain.docstore.Document` objects - `Redis.from_texts` - Initialize from a list of texts (optionally with metadata) - `Redis.from_texts_return_keys` - Initialize from a list of texts (optionally with metadata) and return the keys - `Redis.from_existing_index` - Initialize from an existing Redis index Below we will use the `Redis.from_texts` method. ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import Redis rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, embeddings, metadatas=metadata, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", index_name=""users"", ) ``` ```python rds.index_name ``` ```text \'users\' ``` ## Inspecting the Created Index Once the `Redis` VectorStore object has been constructed, an index will have been created in Redis if it did not already exist. The index can be inspected with both the `rvl`and the `redis-cli` command line tool. If you installed `redisvl` above, you can use the `rvl` command line tool to inspect the index. ```bash # assumes you\'re running Redis locally (use --host, --port, --password, --username, to change this) rvl index listall ``` ```text 16:58:26 [RedisVL] INFO Indices: 16:58:26 [RedisVL] INFO 1. users ``` The `Redis` VectorStore implementation will attempt to generate index schema (fields for filtering) for any metadata passed through the `from_texts`, `from_texts_return_keys`, and `from_documents` methods. This way, whatever metadata is passed will be indexed into the Redis search index allowing for filtering on those fields. Below we show what fields were created from the metadata we defined above ```bash rvl index info -i users ``` ```text Index Information: Index Name Storage Type Prefixes Index Options Indexing users HASH [\'doc:users\'] [] 0 Index Fields: Name Attribute Type Field Option Option Value user user TEXT WEIGHT 1 job job TEXT WEIGHT 1 credit_score credit_score TEXT WEIGHT 1 content content TEXT WEIGHT 1 age age NUMERIC content_vector content_vector VECTOR ``` ```bash rvl stats -i users ``` ```text Statistics: Stat Key Value num_docs 5 num_terms 15 max_doc_id 5 num_records 33 percent_indexed 1 hash_indexing_failures 0 number_of_uses 4 bytes_per_record_avg 4.60606 doc_table_size_mb 0.000524521 inverted_sz_mb 0.000144958 key_table_size_mb 0.000193596 offset_bits_per_record_avg 8 offset_vectors_sz_mb 2.19345e-05 offsets_per_term_avg 0.69697 records_per_doc_avg 6.6 sortable_values_size_mb 0 total_indexing_time 0.32 total_inverted_index_blocks 16 vector_index_sz_mb 6.0126 ``` It\'s important to note that we have not specified that the `user`, `job`, `credit_score` and `age` in the metadata should be fields within the index, this is because the `Redis` VectorStore object automatically generate the index schema from the passed metadata. For more information on the generation of index fields, see the API documentation. ## Querying\u200b There are multiple ways to query the `Redis` VectorStore implementation based on what use case you have: - `similarity_search`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector. - `similarity_search_with_score`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector and return the vector distance - `similarity_search_limit_score`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector and limit the number of results to the `score_threshold` - `similarity_search_with_relevance_scores`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector and return the vector similarities - `max_marginal_relevance_search`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector while also optimizing for diversity ```python results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"") print(results[0].page_content) ``` ```text foo ``` ```python # return metadata results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3) meta = results[1].metadata print(""Key of the document in Redis: "", meta.pop(""id"")) print(""Metadata of the document: "", meta) ``` ```text Key of the document in Redis: doc:users:a70ca43b3a4e4168bae57c78753a200f Metadata of the document: {\'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'} ``` ```python # with scores (distances) results = rds.similarity_search_with_score(""foo"", k=5) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Score: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: bar --- Score: 0.1566 Content: bar --- Score: 0.1566 ``` ```python # limit the vector distance that can be returned results = rds.similarity_search_with_score(""foo"", k=5, distance_threshold=0.1) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Score: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 ``` ```python # with scores results = rds.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(""foo"", k=5) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Similiarity: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Similiarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similiarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similiarity: 1.0 Content: bar --- Similiarity: 0.8434 Content: bar --- Similiarity: 0.8434 ``` ```python # limit scores (similarities have to be over .9) results = rds.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(""foo"", k=5, score_threshold=0.9) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Similarity: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Similarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similarity: 1.0 ``` ```python # you can also add new documents as follows new_document = [""baz""] new_metadata = [{""user"": ""sam"", ""age"": 50, ""job"": ""janitor"", ""credit_score"": ""high""}] # both the document and metadata must be lists rds.add_texts(new_document, new_metadata) ``` ```text [\'doc:users:b9c71d62a0a34241a37950b448dafd38\'] ``` ```python # now query the new document results = rds.similarity_search(""baz"", k=3) print(results[0].metadata) ``` ```text {\'id\': \'doc:users:b9c71d62a0a34241a37950b448dafd38\', \'user\': \'sam\', \'job\': \'janitor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'50\'} ``` ```python # use maximal marginal relevance search to diversify results results = rds.max_marginal_relevance_search(""foo"") ``` ```python # the lambda_mult parameter controls the diversity of the results, the lower the more diverse results = rds.max_marginal_relevance_search(""foo"", lambda_mult=0.1) ``` ## Connect to an Existing Index\u200b In order to have the same metadata indexed when using the `Redis` VectorStore. You will need to have the same `index_schema` passed in either as a path to a yaml file or as a dictionary. The following shows how to obtain the schema from an index and connect to an existing index. ```python # write the schema to a yaml file rds.write_schema(""redis_schema.yaml"") ``` The schema file for this example should look something like: ```yaml numeric: - name: age no_index: false sortable: false text: - name: user no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false - name: job no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false - name: credit_score no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false - name: content no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false vector: - algorithm: FLAT block_size: 1000 datatype: FLOAT32 dims: 1536 distance_metric: COSINE initial_cap: 20000 name: content_vector ``` **Notice**, this include **all** possible fields for the schema. You can remove any fields that you don\'t need. ```python # now we can connect to our existing index as follows new_rds = Redis.from_existing_index( embeddings, index_name=""users"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", schema=""redis_schema.yaml"", ) results = new_rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3) print(results[0].metadata) ``` ```text {\'id\': \'doc:users:8484c48a032d4c4cbe3cc2ed6845fabb\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'} ``` ```python # see the schemas are the same new_rds.schema == rds.schema ``` ```text True ``` ## Custom Metadata Indexing\u200b In some cases, you may want to control what fields the metadata maps to. For example, you may want the `credit_score` field to be a categorical field instead of a text field (which is the default behavior for all string fields). In this case, you can use the `index_schema` parameter in each of the initialization methods above to specify the schema for the index. Custom index schema can either be passed as a dictionary or as a path to a yaml file. All arguments in the schema have defaults besides the name, so you can specify only the fields you want to change. All the names correspond to the snake/lowercase versions of the arguments you would use on the command line with `redis-cli` or in `redis-py`. For more on the arguments for each field, see the [documentation]( The below example shows how to specify the schema for the `credit_score` field as a Tag (categorical) field instead of a text field. ```yaml # index_schema.yml tag: - name: credit_score text: - name: user - name: job numeric: - name: age ``` In Python this would look like: ```python index_schema = { ""tag"": [{""name"": ""credit_score""}], ""text"": [{""name"": ""user""}, {""name"": ""job""}], ""numeric"": [{""name"": ""age""}], } ``` Notice that only the `name` field needs to be specified. All other fields have defaults. ```python # create a new index with the new schema defined above index_schema = { ""tag"": [{""name"": ""credit_score""}], ""text"": [{""name"": ""user""}, {""name"": ""job""}], ""numeric"": [{""name"": ""age""}], } rds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys( texts, embeddings, metadatas=metadata, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", index_name=""users_modified"", index_schema=index_schema, # pass in the new index schema ) ``` ```text `index_schema` does not match generated metadata schema. If you meant to manually override the schema, please ignore this message. index_schema: {\'tag\': [{\'name\': \'credit_score\'}], \'text\': [{\'name\': \'user\'}, {\'name\': \'job\'}], \'numeric\': [{\'name\': \'age\'}]} generated_schema: {\'text\': [{\'name\': \'user\'}, {\'name\': \'job\'}, {\'name\': \'credit_score\'}], \'numeric\': [{\'name\': \'age\'}], \'tag\': []} ``` The above warning is meant to notify users when they are overriding the default behavior. Ignore it if you are intentionally overriding the behavior. ## Hybrid Filtering\u200b With the Redis Filter Expression language built into langchain, you can create arbitrarily long chains of hybrid filters that can be used to filter your search results. The expression language is derived from the [RedisVL Expression Syntax]( and is designed to be easy to use and understand. The following are the available filter types: - `RedisText`: Filter by full-text search against metadata fields. Supports exact, fuzzy, and wildcard matching. - `RedisNum`: Filter by numeric range against metadata fields. - `RedisTag`: Filter by exact match against string based categorical metadata fields. Multiple tags can be specified like ""tag1,tag2,tag3"". The following are examples of utilizing these filters. ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisText, RedisNum, RedisTag # exact matching has_high_credit = RedisTag(""credit_score"") == ""high"" does_not_have_high_credit = RedisTag(""credit_score"") != ""low"" # fuzzy matching job_starts_with_eng = RedisText(""job"") % ""eng*"" job_is_engineer = RedisText(""job"") == ""engineer"" job_is_not_engineer = RedisText(""job"") != ""engineer"" # numeric filtering age_is_18 = RedisNum(""age"") == 18 age_is_not_18 = RedisNum(""age"") != 18 age_is_greater_than_18 = RedisNum(""age"") > 18 age_is_less_than_18 = RedisNum(""age"") < 18 age_is_greater_than_or_equal_to_18 = RedisNum(""age"") >= 18 age_is_less_than_or_equal_to_18 = RedisNum(""age"") <= 18 ``` The `RedisFilter` class can be used to simplify the import of these filters as follows ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisFilter # same examples as above has_high_credit = RedisFilter.tag(""credit_score"") == ""high"" does_not_have_high_credit = RedisFilter.num(""age"") > 8 job_starts_with_eng = RedisFilter.text(""job"") % ""eng*"" ``` The following are examples of using hybrid filter for search ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisText is_engineer = RedisText(""job"") == ""engineer"" results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3, filter=is_engineer) print(""Job:"", results[0].metadata[""job""]) print(""Engineers in the dataset:"", len(results)) ``` ```text Job: engineer Engineers in the dataset: 2 ``` ```python # fuzzy match starts_with_doc = RedisText(""job"") % ""doc*"" results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3, filter=starts_with_doc) for result in results: print(""Job:"", result.metadata[""job""]) print(""Jobs in dataset that start with \'doc\':"", len(results)) ``` ```text Job: doctor Job: doctor Jobs in dataset that start with \'doc\': 2 ``` ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisNum is_over_18 = RedisNum(""age"") > 18 is_under_99 = RedisNum(""age"") < 99 age_range = is_over_18 & is_under_99 results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", filter=age_range) for result in results: print(""User:"", result.metadata[""user""], ""is"", result.metadata[""age""]) ``` ```text User: derrick is 45 User: nancy is 94 User: joe is 35 ``` ```python # make sure to use parenthesis around FilterExpressions # if initializing them while constructing them age_range = (RedisNum(""age"") > 18) & (RedisNum(""age"") < 99) results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", filter=age_range) for result in results: print(""User:"", result.metadata[""user""], ""is"", result.metadata[""age""]) ``` ```text User: derrick is 45 User: nancy is 94 User: joe is 35 ``` ## Redis as Retriever\u200b Here we go over different options for using the vector store as a retriever. There are three different search methods we can use to do retrieval. By default, it will use semantic similarity. ```python query = ""foo"" results = rds.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=3, return_metadata=True) for result in results: print(""Content:"", result[0].page_content, "" --- Score: "", result[1]) ``` ```text Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 ``` ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 4}) ``` ```python docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) docs ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:988ecca7574048e396756efc0e79aeca\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:009b1afeb4084cc6bdef858c7a99b48e\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:7087cee9be5b4eca93c30fbdd09a2731\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'}), Document(page_content=\'bar\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:01ef6caac12b42c28ad870aefe574253\', \'user\': \'tyler\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'100\'})] ``` There is also the `similarity_distance_threshold` retriever which allows the user to specify the vector distance ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever( search_type=""similarity_distance_threshold"", search_kwargs={""k"": 4, ""distance_threshold"": 0.1}, ) ``` ```python docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) docs ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:988ecca7574048e396756efc0e79aeca\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:009b1afeb4084cc6bdef858c7a99b48e\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:7087cee9be5b4eca93c30fbdd09a2731\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'})] ``` Lastly, the `similarity_score_threshold` allows the user to define the minimum score for similar documents ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever( search_type=""similarity_score_threshold"", search_kwargs={""score_threshold"": 0.9, ""k"": 10}, ) ``` ```python retriever.get_relevant_documents(""foo"") ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:988ecca7574048e396756efc0e79aeca\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:009b1afeb4084cc6bdef858c7a99b48e\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:7087cee9be5b4eca93c30fbdd09a2731\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'})] ``` ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever( search_type=""mmr"", search_kwargs={""fetch_k"": 20, ""k"": 4, ""lambda_mult"": 0.1} ) ``` ```python retriever.get_relevant_documents(""foo"") ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:8f6b673b390647809d510112cde01a27\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'bar\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:93521560735d42328b48c9c6f6418d6a\', \'user\': \'tyler\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'100\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:125ecd39d07845eabf1a699d44134a5b\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:d6200ab3764c466082fde3eaab972a2a\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'})] ``` # Delete keys To delete your entries you have to address them by their keys. ```python Redis.delete(keys, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"") ``` ```text True ``` ```python # delete the indices too Redis.drop_index( index_name=""users"", delete_documents=True, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"" ) Redis.drop_index( index_name=""users_modified"", delete_documents=True, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) ``` ```text True ``` ### Redis connection Url examples\u200b Valid Redis Url scheme are: 1. `redis://` -

Create a Github App [Follow the instructions here]( to create and register a Github app. Make sure your app has the following [repository permissions:]( - Commit statuses (read only) - Contents (read and write) - Issues (read and write) - Metadata (read only) - Pull requests (read and write) Once the app has been registered, add it to the repository you wish the bot to act upon. ### 3. Set Environmental Variables Before initializing your agent, the following environmental variables need to be set: - **GITHUB_APP_ID**- A six digit number found in your app\'s general settings - **GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY**- The location of your app\'s private key .pem file - **GITHUB_REPOSITORY**- The name of the Github repository you want your bot to act upon. Must follow the format {username}/{repo-name}. Make sure the app has been added to this repository first! - **GITHUB_BRANCH**- The branch where the bot will make its commits. Defaults to \'master.\' - **GITHUB_BASE_BRANCH**- The base branch of your repo, usually either \'main\' or \'master.\' This is where pull requests will base from. Defaults to \'master.\' ## Example: Simple Agent ```python import os from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.github.toolkit import GitHubToolkit from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities.github import GitHubAPIWrapper ``` ```python # Set your environment variables using os.environ os.environ[""GITHUB_APP_ID""] = ""123456"" os.environ[""GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY""] = ""path/to/your/private-key.pem"" os.environ[""GITHUB_REPOSITORY""] = ""username/repo-name"" os.environ[""GITHUB_BRANCH""] = ""bot-branch-name"" os.environ[""GITHUB_BASE_BRANCH""] = ""main"" # This example also requires an OpenAI API key os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """" ``` ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) github = GitHubAPIWrapper() toolkit = GitHubToolkit.from_github_api_wrapper(github) agent = initialize_agent( toolkit.get_tools(), llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""You have the software engineering capabilities of a Google Principle engineer.

Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`. Do not respond with more than one word. {question} Classification:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I call Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text \' Anthropic\' ``` Now, let\'s create three sub chains: ```python langchain_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in langchain. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Harrison Chase told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) anthropic_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in anthropic. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Dario Amodei told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) general_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch branch = RunnableBranch( (lambda x: ""anthropic"" in x[""topic""].lower(), anthropic_chain), (lambda x: ""langchain"" in x[""topic""].lower(), langchain_chain), general_chain, ) ``` ```python full_chain = {""topic"": chain, ""question"": lambda x: x[""question""]} | branch ``` ```python full_chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I use Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content="" As Dario Amodei told me, here are some ways to use Anthropic:\\n\\n- Sign up for an account on Anthropic\'s website to access tools like Claude, Constitutional AI, and Writer. \\n\\n- Use Claude for tasks like email generation, customer service chat, and QA.

[Anthropic]( is an AI safety and research company, and is the creator of Claude. This page covers all integrations between Anthropic models and LangChain. ## Prompting Overview Claude is chat-based model, meaning it is trained on conversation data. However, it is a text based API, meaning it takes in single string. It expects this string to be in a particular format. This means that it is up the user to ensure that is the case. LangChain provides several utilities and helper functions to make sure prompts that you write - whether formatted as a string or as a list of messages - end up formatted correctly. Specifically, Claude is trained to fill in text for the Assistant role as part of an ongoing dialogue between a human user (`Human:`) and an AI assistant (`Assistant:`). Prompts sent via the API must contain `\\n\\nHuman:` and `\\n\\nAssistant:` as the signals of who\'s speaking. The final turn must always be `\\n\\nAssistant:` - the input string cannot have `\\n\\nHuman:` as the final role. Because Claude is chat-based but accepts a string as input, it can be treated as either a LangChain `ChatModel` or `LLM`. This means there are two wrappers in LangChain - `ChatAnthropic` and `Anthropic`. It is generally recommended to use the `ChatAnthropic` wrapper, and format your prompts as `ChatMessage`s (we will show examples of this below). This is because it keeps your prompt in a general format that you can easily then also use with other models (should you want to). However, if you want more fine-grained control over the prompt, you can use the `Anthropic` wrapper - we will show and example of this as well. The `Anthropic` wrapper however is deprecated, as all functionality can be achieved in a more generic way using `ChatAnthropic`. ## Prompting Best Practices Anthropic models have several prompting best practices compared to OpenAI models. **No System Messages** Anthropic models are not trained on the concept of a ""system message"". We have worked with the Anthropic team to handle them somewhat appropriately (a Human message with an `admin` tag) but this is largely a hack and it is recommended that you do not use system messages. **AI Messages Can Continue** A completion from Claude is a continuation of the last text in the string which allows you further control over Claude\'s output. For example, putting words in Claude\'s mouth in a prompt like this: `\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: What do you call a bear with no teeth?` This will return a completion like this `A gummy bear!` instead of a whole new assistant message with a different random bear joke. ## ChatAnthropic `ChatAnthropic` is a subclass of LangChain\'s `ChatModel`, meaning it works best with `ChatPromptTemplate`. You can import this wrapper with the following code: ```text from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic model = ChatAnthropic() ``` When working with ChatModels, it is preferred that you design your prompts as `ChatPromptTemplate`s. Here is an example below of doing that: ```text from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", ""You are a helpful chatbot""), (""human"", ""Tell me a joke about {topic}""), ]) ``` You can then use this in a chain as follows: ```text chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` How is the prompt actually being formatted under the hood? We can see that by running the following code ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nYou are a helpful chatbot\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that under the hood LangChain is not appending any prefix/suffix to `SystemMessage`\'s. This is because Anthropic has no concept of `SystemMessage`. Anthropic requires all prompts to end with assistant messages. This means if the last message is not an assistant message, the suffix `Assistant:` will automatically be inserted. If you decide instead to use a normal PromptTemplate (one that just works on a single string) let\'s take a look at what happens: ```text from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that it automatically adds the Human and Assistant tags. What is happening under the hood? First: the string gets converted to a single human message. This happens generically (because we are using a subclass of `ChatModel`). Then, similarly to the above example, an empty Assistant message is getting appended. This is Anthropic specific. ## [Deprecated] Anthropic This `Anthropic` wrapper is subclassed from `LLM`. We can import it with: ```text from langchain.llms import Anthropic model = Anthropic() ``` This model class is designed to work with normal PromptTemplates. An example of that is below: ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` Let\'s see what is going on with the prompt templating under the hood! ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs the following ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:\\n\' ``` Notice that it adds the Human tag at the start of the string, and then finishes it with `\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:`. The extra `Sure, here you go` was added on purpose by the Anthropic team. What happens if we have those symbols in the prompt directly? ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Human: Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\' ``` We can see that we detect that the user is trying to use the special tokens, and so we don\'t do any formatting. - [Prompting Overview](#prompting-overview) - [Prompting Best Practices](#prompting-best-practices) - [ChatAnthropic](#chatanthropic) - [Deprecated Anthropic](#deprecated-anthropic)']","To use a React Agent with an Anthropic model, you'll need to integrate the Anthropic model into a React application. Here's a simplified approach:

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   npm install @langchain/anthropic react-query
   ```

2. **Set Up Anthropic Model**:
   Create a file `anthropicModel.js` to handle the Anthropic model:
   ```javascript
   import { createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
   import axios from 'axios';

   const apiKey = 'YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY';

   export const fetchAnthropicResponse = createAsyncThunk(
     'anthropic/fetchResponse',
     async (question) => {
       const response = await axios.post(
         'https://api.anthropic.com/v1/complete',
         {
           message: {
             role: 'user',
             content: question,
           },
         },
         {
           headers: {
             'Content-Type': 'application/json',
             'X-API-KEY': apiKey,
           },
         }
       );
       return response.data.completion;
     }
   );
   ```

3. **Create React Component**:
   ```javascript
   import React, { useState } from 'react';
   import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
   import { fetchAnthropicResponse } from './anthropicModel';

   const ReactAgent = () => {
     const dispatch = useDispatch();
     const { loading, error, response } = useSelector((state) => state.anthropic);

     const [question, setQuestion] = useState('');

     const handleSubmit = (e) => {
       e.preventDefault();
       dispatch(fetchAnthropicResponse(question));
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
           <input
             type=""text""
             value={question}
             onChange={(e) => setQuestion(e.target.value)}
             placeholder=""Ask a question...""
           />
           <button type=""submit"">Ask</button>
         </form>
         {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
         {error && <p>Error: {error}</p>}
         {response && <p>Response: {response}</p>}
       ","In order to use a ReAct Agent with an Anthropic model, you should first install the reuqired packages:

pip install anthropic

Next, import the necessary classes and functions:

    from langchain.agents import load_tools
    from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
    from langchain.agents import AgentType
    from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic

Next, create an instance of ChatAnthropic. Make sure you have set your API key in an environment variable called ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or pass anthropic_api_key as a parameter.

    chat = ChatAnthropic()

Next, load some tools for your agent to use:

    # Specify tools (these can be any custom tool, the following are examples)
tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=chat)

Finally, let's initialize an agent with the tools, the language model, and the type of agent we want to use.

    agent = initialize_agent(tools, chat, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

Now, enter a prompt to test it out:

48,How do I use Qdrant as a vector store in the conversational retrieval chain?,"['Qdrant | Qdrant [Qdrant]( (read: quadrant ) is a vector similarity search engine. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points - vectors with an additional payload. `Qdrant` is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications. This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `Qdrant` vector database. There are various modes of how to run `Qdrant`, and depending on the chosen one, there will be some subtle differences. The options include: - Local mode, no server required - On-premise server deployment - Qdrant Cloud See the [installation instructions]( ```bash pip install qdrant-client ``` We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` ```text OpenAI API Key: ``` ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant ``` ```python loader = TextLoader(""../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ## Connecting to Qdrant from LangChain ### Local mode Python client allows you to run the same code in local mode without running the Qdrant server. That\'s great for testing things out and debugging or if you plan to store just a small amount of vectors. The embeddings might be fully kepy in memory or persisted on disk. #### In-memory For some testing scenarios and quick experiments, you may prefer to keep all the data in memory only, so it gets lost when the client is destroyed - usually at the end of your script/notebook. ```python qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, location="":memory:"", # Local mode with in-memory storage only collection_name=""my_documents"", ) ``` #### On-disk storage Local mode, without using the Qdrant server, may also store your vectors on disk so they\'re persisted between runs. ```python qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, path=""/tmp/local_qdrant"", collection_name=""my_documents"", ) ``` ### On-premise server deployment No matter if you choose to launch Qdrant locally with [a Docker container]( or select a Kubernetes deployment with [the official Helm chart]( the way you\'re going to connect to such an instance will be identical. You\'ll need to provide a URL pointing to the service. ```python url = """" qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, url=url, prefer_grpc=True, collection_name=""my_documents"", ) ``` ### Qdrant Cloud If you prefer not to keep yourself busy with managing the infrastructure, you can choose to set up a fully-managed Qdrant cluster on [Qdrant Cloud]( There is a free forever 1GB cluster included for trying out. The main difference with using a managed version of Qdrant is that you\'ll need to provide an API key to secure your deployment from being accessed publicly. ```python url = """" api_key = """" qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, url=url, prefer_grpc=True, api_key=api_key, collection_name=""my_documents"", ) ``` ## Recreating the collection Both `Qdrant.from_texts` and `Qdrant.from_documents` methods are great to start using Qdrant with Langchain. In the previous versions the collection was recreated every time you called any of them. That behaviour has changed. Currently, the collection is going to be reused if it already exists. Setting `force_recreate` to `True` allows to remove the old collection and start from scratch. ```python url = """" qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, url=url, prefer_grpc=True, collection_name=""my_documents"", force_recreate=True, ) ``` ## Similarity search The simplest scenario for using Qdrant vector store is to perform a similarity search. Under the hood, our query will be encoded with the `embedding_function` and used to find similar documents in Qdrant collection. ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search(query) ``` ```python print(found_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tonight.

The returned distance score is cosine distance. Therefore, a lower score is better. ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search_with_score(query) ``` ```python document, score = found_docs[0] print(document.page_content) print(f""\\nScore: {score}"") ``` ```text Tonight.

Score: 0.8153784913324512 ``` ### Metadata filtering Qdrant has an [extensive filtering system]( with rich type support. It is also possible to use the filters in Langchain, by passing an additional param to both the `similarity_search_with_score` and `similarity_search` methods. ```python from qdrant_client.http import models as rest query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search_with_score(query, filter=rest.Filter(...)) ``` ## Maximum marginal relevance search (MMR) If you\'d like to look up for some similar documents, but you\'d also like to receive diverse results, MMR is method you should consider. Maximal marginal relevance optimizes for similarity to query AND diversity among selected documents. ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" found_docs = qdrant.max_marginal_relevance_search(query, k=2, fetch_k=10) ``` ```python for i, doc in enumerate(found_docs): print(f""{i + 1}."", doc.page_content, ""\\n"") ``` ```text 1.

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. Officer Mora was 27 years old. Officer Rivera was 22. Both Dominican Americans who\'d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. I\'ve worked on these issues a long time. I know what works: Investing in crime prevention and community police officers who\'ll walk the beat, who\'ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. ``` ## Qdrant as a Retriever Qdrant, as all the other vector stores, is a LangChain Retriever, by using cosine similarity. ```python retriever = qdrant.as_retriever() retriever ``` ```text VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=, search_type=\'similarity\', search_kwargs={}) ``` It might be also specified to use MMR as a search strategy, instead of similarity. ```python retriever = qdrant.as_retriever(search_type=""mmr"") retriever ``` ```text VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=, search_type=\'mmr\', search_kwargs={}) ``` ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)[0] ``` ```text Document(page_content=\'Tonight.

In such cases you may need to define how to map Qdrant point into the Langchain `Document`. ### Named vectors Qdrant supports [multiple vectors per point]( by named vectors. Langchain requires just a single embedding per document and, by default, uses a single vector. However, if you work with a collection created externally or want to have the named vector used, you can configure it by providing its name. ```python Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, location="":memory:"", collection_name=""my_documents_2"", vector_name=""custom_vector"", ) ``` As a Langchain user, you won\'t see any difference whether you use named vectors or not. Qdrant integration will handle the conversion under the hood. ### Metadata Qdrant stores your vector embeddings along with the optional JSON-like payload. Payloads are optional, but since LangChain assumes the embeddings are generated from the documents, we keep the context data, so you can extract the original texts as well. By default, your document is going to be stored in the following payload structure: ```json { ""page_content"": ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"", ""metadata"": { ""foo"": ""bar"" } } ``` You can, however, decide to use different keys for the page content and metadata. That\'s useful if you already have a collection that you\'d like to reuse. ```python Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, location="":memory:"", collection_name=""my_documents_2"", content_payload_key=""my_page_content_key"", metadata_payload_key=""my_meta"", ) ``` ```text ``` - [Connecting to Qdrant from LangChain](#connecting-to-qdrant-from-langchain)- [Local mode](#local-mode) - [On-premise server deployment](#on-premise-server-deployment) - [Qdrant Cloud](#qdrant-cloud) - [Recreating the collection](#recreating-the-collection) - [Similarity search](#similarity-search) - [Similarity search with score](#similarity-search-with-score)- [Metadata filtering](#metadata-filtering) - [Maximum marginal relevance search (MMR)](#maximum-marginal-relevance-search-mmr) - [Qdrant as a Retriever](#qdrant-as-a-retriever) - [Customizing Qdrant](#customizing-qdrant)- [Named vectors](#named-vectors) - [Metadata](#metadata)', 'Vector stores | Vector stores infoHead to [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) for documentation on built-in integrations with 3rd-party vector stores. One of the most common ways to store and search over unstructured data is to embed it and store the resulting embedding vectors, and then at query time to embed the unstructured query and retrieve the embedding vectors that are \'most similar\' to the embedded query. A vector store takes care of storing embedded data and performing vector search for you. ![vector store diagram](/assets/images/vector_stores-9dc1ecb68c4cb446df110764c9cc07e0.jpg) ## Get started This walkthrough showcases basic functionality related to vector stores. A key part of working with vector stores is creating the vector to put in them, which is usually created via embeddings. Therefore, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the [text embedding model](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) interfaces before diving into this. There are many great vector store options, here are a few that are free, open-source, and run entirely on your local machine. Review all integrations for many great hosted offerings. Chroma This walkthrough uses the `chroma` vector database, which runs on your local machine as a library. ```bash pip install chromadb ``` We want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. ```python import os import getpass os.environ[\'OPENAI_API_KEY\'] = getpass.getpass(\'OpenAI API Key:\') ``` ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma # Load the document, split it into chunks, embed each chunk and load it into the vector store. raw_documents = TextLoader(\'../../../state_of_the_union.txt\').load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) documents = text_splitter.split_documents(raw_documents) db = Chroma.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` FAISS This walkthrough uses the `FAISS` vector database, which makes use of the Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) library. ```bash pip install faiss-cpu ``` We want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. ```python import os import getpass os.environ[\'OPENAI_API_KEY\'] = getpass.getpass(\'OpenAI API Key:\') ``` ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS # Load the document, split it into chunks, embed each chunk and load it into the vector store. raw_documents = TextLoader(\'../../../state_of_the_union.txt\').load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) documents = text_splitter.split_documents(raw_documents) db = FAISS.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Lance This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the LanceDB vector database based on the Lance data format. ```bash pip install lancedb ``` We want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. ```python import os import getpass os.environ[\'OPENAI_API_KEY\'] = getpass.getpass(\'OpenAI API Key:\') ``` ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import LanceDB import lancedb db = lancedb.connect(""/tmp/lancedb"") table = db.create_table( ""my_table"", data=[ { ""vector"": embeddings.embed_query(""Hello World""), ""text"": ""Hello World"", ""id"": ""1"", } ], mode=""overwrite"", ) # Load the document, split it into chunks, embed each chunk and load it into the vector store. raw_documents = TextLoader(\'../../../state_of_the_union.txt\').load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) documents = text_splitter.split_documents(raw_documents) db = LanceDB.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings(), connection=table) ``` ### Similarity search ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" docs = db.similarity_search(query) print(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tonight.

That gives performance benefits as you don\'t waste time waiting for responses from external services. That might also be important if you work with an asynchronous framework, such as [FastAPI]( LangChain supports async operation on vector stores. All the methods might be called using their async counterparts, with the prefix `a`, meaning `async`. `Qdrant` is a vector store, which supports all the async operations, thus it will be used in this walkthrough. ```bash pip install qdrant-client ``` ```python from langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant ``` ### Create a vector store asynchronously ```python db = await Qdrant.afrom_documents(documents, embeddings, "" ``` ### Similarity search ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" docs = await db.asimilarity_search(query) print(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tonight.

To import this vectorstore: ```python from langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant ``` For a more detailed walkthrough of the Qdrant wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/qdrant) - [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) - [Vector Store](#vector-store)']","To use Qdrant as a vector store in a conversational retrieval chain, follow these steps:

1. **Install Qdrant Client**:
   ```bash
   pip install qdrant-client
   ```

2. **Import Required Libraries**:
   ```python
   from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
   from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
   from langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant
   from qdrant_client.http.models import PointStruct
   ```

3. **Create Embeddings**:
   ```python
   embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
   ```

4. **Load and Split Documents**:
   ```python
   from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
   from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

   loader = TextLoader(""path_to_your_document.txt"")
   documents = loader.load()
   text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
   chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
   ```

5. **Create Qdrant Vector Store**:
   ```python
   qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents(
       chunks,
       embeddings,
       collection_name=""my_collection"",
       location="":memory:""  # Use "":memory:"" for in-memory storage or specify a path for on-disk storage
   )
   ```

6. **Create Retrieval Chain**:
   ```python
   chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
       retriever=qdrant.as_retriever(),
       return_source_documents=True
   )
   ```

7. **Interact with the Chain**:
   ```python
   query = ""Your question here""
   result = chain.run(query, chat_history=[])
   print(result['answer'])
   ```

This setup allows you to use Qdrant as a vector store within a conversational retrieval chain.","In order to use Qdrant as a vector store in the conversational retrieval chain, you should start by installing Qdrant:

    pip install qdrant-client

Next, import the necessary classes and functions:

    from langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant
    from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
    from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI
    from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
    from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
    from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

Load, split, and embed your documents:

    loader = TextLoader(""state_of_the_union.txt"")
    documents = loader.load()

    text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0, separator=""
"")
    documents = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

Next, connect to Qdrant. This is for storing locally on-disk, but you can also use an on-premise server deployment or store on the Qdrant cloud:

    qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents(
        documents,
        embeddings,
        path=""/tmp/local_qdrant"",
        collection_name=""my_documents"",
    )

Next, create a memory object, which is necessary to track the inputs/outputs and hold a conversation:

    memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True)

Now initialize the ConversationalRetrievalChain:

    qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), qdrant.as_retriever(), memory=memory)

Now, you can create queries to test it out:

    query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
    result = qa({""question"": query})

Output:

    The president said that he had nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the United States Supreme Court four days ago.

    query = ""Who are they succeeding?""
    result = qa({""question"": query})

Output:

49,How do I use Summary Memory in the conversational retrieval chain?,"['Chatbots | Chatbots []( ## Use case Chatbots are one of the central LLM use-cases. The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1. Simple prompting: Agents can use Language Model based prompting to break down tasks into subgoals. For example, by providing prompts like ""Steps for XYZ"" or ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", the agent can generate a sequence of smaller steps that lead to the completion of the overall task.\\n\\n2. Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to ""Write a story outline."" This provides a high-level structure for the task and helps in breaking it down into smaller components.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Agents can also take inputs from humans to decompose tasks. This can be done through direct communication or by leveraging human expertise. Humans can provide guidance and insights to help the agent break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals.\\n\\nOverall, task decomposition allows agents to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals, enabling them to plan and execute complex tasks efficiently.\'} ``` ```python qa(""What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'The human asks how agents use task decomposition.

Long-Term Memory Management: This involves storing and organizing information in a long-term memory system. The agent can retrieve past experiences, knowledge, and learned strategies to guide the task decomposition process.\\n\\n2. Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents. This allows for easy retrieval and reference during the execution of the task.\\n\\nThese memory resources help the agent in organizing and managing information, making informed decisions, and effectively decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals.\'} ``` Again, we can use the [LangSmith trace]( to explore the prompt structure. ### Going deeper - Agents, such as the [conversational retrieval agent](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents), can be used for retrieval when necessary while also holding a conversation. - [Use case](#use-case) - [Overview](#overview) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Memory](#memory) - [Conversation](#conversation) - [Chat Retrieval](#chat-retrieval)- [Going deeper](#going-deeper)', 'Multiple Memory classes | Multiple Memory classes We can use multiple memory classes in the same chain.

1. **Install Required Libraries**: Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You'll need `langchain`, `openai`, and any other dependencies.

    ```bash
    pip install langchain openai
    ```

2. **Load Documents**: Load the documents you want to use for retrieval.

    ```python
    from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
    loader = WebBaseLoader(""https://example.com/document"")
    data = loader.load()
    ```

3. **Split and Embed Documents**: Split the documents into chunks and create embeddings for them.

    ```python
    from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
    from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
    from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0)
    all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data)

    vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())
    ```

4. **Create Retriever**: Create a retriever from the vectorstore.

    ```python
    from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
    from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

    llm = ChatOpenAI()
    retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
    ```

5. **Initialize Conversational Retrieval Chain with Summary Memory**: Use `ConversationSummaryMemory` to maintain a summary of the conversation.

    ```python
    from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory

    memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm)
    qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory)
    ```

6. **Run Queries**: Now you can run queries and the chain will use the summary memory to provide context-aware responses.

    ```python
    result = qa.run(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"")
    print(result)
    ```

This setup will allow you to use Summary Memory in a conversational retrieval chain, providing context-aware and summarized responses based on the retrieved documents.","In order to use Summary Memory in the conversational retrieval chain, you should first import the necessary classes and functions:

        from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory
    from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
    from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma # You can choose any LangChain vectorstore
    from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
    from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI # You can choose any LangChain vectorstore
    from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
    from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader

Split and embed your documents, and add them to your selected vectorstore:

    loader = TextLoader(""state_of_the_union.txt"")
    documents = loader.load()

    text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0, separator=""
"")
    documents = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents, embeddings)

Next, create a ConversationSummaryMemory object:

    memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo""), memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True)

Now initialize the ConversationalRetrievalChain:

    qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"",temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever(), memory=memory)

Now, you can create queries to test it out:

    query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
    result = qa({""question"": query})

Output:

    The president said that he had nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the United States Supreme Court four days ago.

    query = ""Who are they succeeding?""
    result = qa.invoke({""question"": query})

Output:

On the other hand, a decoder is a component that takes in a sequence of hidden representations and generates a sequence of output tokens. The main difference between the two is that the encoder is used to encode the input sequence into a fixed-length representation, while the decoder is used to decode the fixed-length representation into an output sequence. In machine translation, for example, the encoder reads in the source language sentence and generates a fixed-length representation, which is then used by the decoder to generate the target language sentence.\' ``` ```python query = ""For any token, what are x, k, v, and q?"" qa_chain.run(query) ``` ```text \'For any token, x is the input vector that contains the private information of that token, k and q are the key and query vectors respectively, which are produced by forwarding linear modules on x, and v is the vector that is calculated by propagating the same linear module on x again.

The vector v is the information that the token will communicate to other tokens if it finds them interesting, and it gets aggregated for the purposes of the self-attention mechanism.\' ``` - [YouTube url to text](#youtube-url-to-text) - [Building a chat app from YouTube video](#building-a-chat-app-from-youtube-video)', 'iMessage | iMessage This notebook shows how to use the iMessage chat loader. This class helps convert iMessage conversations to LangChain chat messages. On MacOS, iMessage stores conversations in a sqlite database at `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` (at least for macOS Ventura 13.4). The `IMessageChatLoader` loads from this database file. 1. Create the `IMessageChatLoader` with the file path pointed to `chat.db` database you\'d like to process. 2. Call `loader.load()` (or `loader.lazy_load()`) to perform the conversion. Optionally use `merge_chat_runs` to combine message from the same sender in sequence, and/or `map_ai_messages` to convert messages from the specified sender to the ""AIMessage"" class. ## 1. Access Chat DB It\'s likely that your terminal is denied access to `~/Library/Messages`. To use this class, you can copy the DB to an accessible directory (e.g., Documents) and load from there. Alternatively (and not recommended), you can grant full disk access for your terminal emulator in System Settings > Security and Privacy > Full Disk Access. We have created an example database you can use at [this linked drive file]( ```python # This uses some example data import requests def download_drive_file(url: str, output_path: str = ""chat.db"") -> None: file_id = url.split(""/"")[-2] download_url = f"" response = requests.get(download_url) if response.status_code != 200: print(""Failed to download the file."") return with open(output_path, ""wb"") as file: file.write(response.content) print(f""File {output_path} downloaded."") url = ( "" ) # Download file to chat.db download_drive_file(url) ``` ```text File chat.db downloaded. ``` ## 2. Create the Chat Loader Provide the loader with the file path to the zip directory. You can optionally specify the user id that maps to an ai message as well an configure whether to merge message runs. ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.imessage import IMessageChatLoader ``` ```python loader = IMessageChatLoader( path=""./chat.db"", ) ``` ## 3. Load messages The `load()` (or `lazy_load`) methods return a list of ""ChatSessions"" that currently just contain a list of messages per loaded conversation. All messages are mapped to ""HumanMessage"" objects to start. You can optionally choose to merge message ""runs"" (consecutive messages from the same sender) and select a sender to represent the ""AI"". The fine-tuned LLM will learn to generate these AI messages. ```python from typing import List from langchain.chat_loaders.base import ChatSession from langchain.chat_loaders.utils import ( map_ai_messages, merge_chat_runs, ) raw_messages = loader.lazy_load() # Merge consecutive messages from the same sender into a single message merged_messages = merge_chat_runs(raw_messages) # Convert messages from ""Tortoise"" to AI messages. Do you have a guess who these conversations are between? chat_sessions: List[ChatSession] = list( map_ai_messages(merged_messages, sender=""Tortoise"") ) ``` ```python # Now all of the Tortoise\'s messages will take the AI message class # which maps to the \'assistant\' role in OpenAI\'s training format alternating_sessions[0][""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [AIMessage(content=""Slow and steady, that\'s my motto."", additional_kwargs={\'message_time\': 1693182723, \'sender\': \'Tortoise\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=\'Speed is key!\', additional_kwargs={\'message_time\': 1693182753, \'sender\': \'Hare\'}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'A balanced approach is more reliable.\', additional_kwargs={\'message_time\': 1693182783, \'sender\': \'Tortoise\'}, example=False)] ``` ## 3. Prepare for fine-tuning Now it\'s time to convert our chat messages to OpenAI dictionaries. We can use the `convert_messages_for_finetuning` utility to do so. ```python from langchain.adapters.openai import convert_messages_for_finetuning ``` ```python training_data = convert_messages_for_finetuning(alternating_sessions) print(f""Prepared {len(training_data)} dialogues for training"") ``` ```text Prepared 10 dialogues for training ``` ## 4. Fine-tune the model It\'s time to fine-tune the model. Make sure you have `openai` installed and have set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` appropriately ```python # %pip install -U openai --quiet ``` ```python import json import time from io import BytesIO import openai # We will write the jsonl file in memory my_file = BytesIO() for m in training_data: my_file.write((json.dumps({""messages"": m}) + ""\\n"").encode(""utf-8"")) my_file.seek(0) training_file = openai.File.create(file=my_file, purpose=""fine-tune"") # OpenAI audits each training file for compliance reasons. # This make take a few minutes status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""processed"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status print(f""File {training_file.id} ready after {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds."") ``` ```text File file-zHIgf4r8LltZG3RFpkGd4Sjf ready after 10.19 seconds. ``` With the file ready, it\'s time to kick off a training job. ```python job = openai.FineTuningJob.create( training_file=training_file.id, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) ``` Grab a cup of tea while your model is being prepared. This may take some time! ```python status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""succeeded"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) job = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id) status = job.status ``` ```text Status=[running]... 524.95s ``` ```python print(job.fine_tuned_model) ``` ```text ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::7sKoRdlz ``` ## 5. Use in LangChain You can use the resulting model ID directly the `ChatOpenAI` model class. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI model = ChatOpenAI( model=job.fine_tuned_model, temperature=1, ) ``` ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are speaking to hare.""), (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) chain = prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python for tok in chain.stream({""input"": ""What\'s the golden thread?""}): print(tok, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text A symbol of interconnectedness. ``` - [1.

To clarify the difference between a document loader and a chat loader:

- **Document Loader**: This type of loader is designed to extract and process information from various document formats. It can handle different types of documents like PDFs, text files, or even web pages. The goal is to convert these documents into a structured format that can be easily processed by other tools or models.

- **Chat Loader**: This type of loader is specifically designed to handle chat or conversation data. It processes chat logs, messages, or conversation threads, often converting them into a format that's suitable for analysis or machine learning models. This might involve parsing messages, identifying participants, and structuring the data in a way that reflects the conversational flow.

Both types of loaders aim to make raw data more accessible and usable for further processing, but they cater to different kinds of data sources.","A document loader is used to load data as Document objects, which are pieces of text with associated metadata. A chat loader is specifically designed to load chat messages from different platforms, such as Discord, Facebook Messenger, Slack, and Telegram.

Here's how you can do it:

### Loading YouTube Transcripts
First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
```bash
!pip install youtube-transcript-api langchain
```

Then, you can use the `YoutubeLoader` to load YouTube transcripts:
```python
from langchain.document_loaders import YoutubeLoader

# Initialize the loader with the YouTube video URL
loader = YoutubeLoader.from_youtube_url(""YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL_HERE"")

# Load the transcript
documents = loader.load()
```

### Loading CSV Documents
To load CSV documents, you need to install the `pandas` library if you haven't already:
```bash
!pip install pandas
```

Then, you can use the `CSVLoader` to load CSV documents:
```python
from langchain.document_loaders import CSVLoader

# Initialize the loader with the path to the CSV file
loader = CSVLoader.from_path(""YOUR_CSV_FILE_PATH_HERE"")

# Load the CSV document
documents = loader.load()
```

Make sure to replace `""YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL_HERE""` and `""YOUR_CSV_FILE_PATH_HERE""` with the actual URL of the YouTube video and the path to your CSV file, respectively.

This approach should help you load both YouTube transcripts and CSV documents effectively.","To load YouTube transcripts in LangChain, you can use the YoutubeLoader document loader. Here's an example of how to do it:

Install the required packages:
```
pip install langchain youtube_transcript_api pytube
```

Import the necessary classes:


    from langchain.document_loaders import YoutubeLoader


Create an instance of the YoutubeLoader class and provide the YouTube video URL:


    loader = YoutubeLoader.from_youtube_url(""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsYGlZkevEg"", add_video_info=True)


Load the transcript using the load method:

    video = loader.load()

To load CSV documents you can use CSVLoader. Follow the steps below:

Import the necessary classes:

    from langchain.document_loaders import CSVLoader


Create an instance of the CSVLoader class and provide the path to the CSV file:


    loader = CSVLoader(file_path=""./example_data/mlb_teams_2012.csv"")

Load the CSV document using the load method:

    loader.load()",0.99999999995,,,0.3780850935680652,0.4583333333333333

The overall steps are: 1. Download your messenger data to disk. 2. Create the Chat Loader and call `loader.load()` (or `loader.lazy_load()`) to perform the conversion. 3. Optionally use `merge_chat_runs` to combine message from the same sender in sequence, and/or `map_ai_messages` to convert messages from the specified sender to the ""AIMessage"" class. Once you\'ve done this, call `convert_messages_for_finetuning` to prepare your data for fine-tuning. Once this has been done, you can fine-tune your model. To do so you would complete the following steps: 1. Upload your messages to OpenAI and run a fine-tuning job. 2. Use the resulting model in your LangChain app! Let\'s begin. ## 1. Download Data To download your own messenger data, following instructions [here]( IMPORTANT - make sure to download them in JSON format (not HTML). We are hosting an example dump at [this google drive link]( that we will use in this walkthrough. ```python # This uses some example data import zipfile import requests def download_and_unzip(url: str, output_path: str = ""file.zip"") -> None: file_id = url.split(""/"")[-2] download_url = f"" response = requests.get(download_url) if response.status_code != 200: print(""Failed to download the file."") return with open(output_path, ""wb"") as file: file.write(response.content) print(f""File {output_path} downloaded."") with zipfile.ZipFile(output_path, ""r"") as zip_ref: zip_ref.extractall() print(f""File {output_path} has been unzipped."") # URL of the file to download url = ( "" ) # Download and unzip download_and_unzip(url) ``` ```text File file.zip downloaded. File file.zip has been unzipped. ``` ## 2. Create Chat Loader We have 2 different `FacebookMessengerChatLoader` classes, one for an entire directory of chats, and one to load individual files. We ```python directory_path = ""./hogwarts"" ``` ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.facebook_messenger import ( FolderFacebookMessengerChatLoader, SingleFileFacebookMessengerChatLoader, ) ``` ```python loader = SingleFileFacebookMessengerChatLoader( path=""./hogwarts/inbox/HermioneGranger/messages_Hermione_Granger.json"", ) ``` ```python chat_session = loader.load()[0] chat_session[""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=""Hi Hermione! How\'s your summer going so far?"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""Harry! Lovely to hear from you. My summer is going well, though I do miss everyone. I\'m spending most of my time going through my books and researching fascinating new topics. How about you?"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Hermione Granger\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""I miss you all too. The Dursleys are being their usual unpleasant selves but I\'m getting by. At least I can practice some spells in my room without them knowing. Let me know if you find anything good in your researching!"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False)] ``` ```python loader = FolderFacebookMessengerChatLoader( path=""./hogwarts"", ) ``` ```python chat_sessions = loader.load() len(chat_sessions) ``` ```text 9 ``` ## 3. Prepare for fine-tuning Calling `load()` returns all the chat messages we could extract as human messages. When conversing with chat bots, conversations typically follow a more strict alternating dialogue pattern relative to real conversations. You can choose to merge message ""runs"" (consecutive messages from the same sender) and select a sender to represent the ""AI"". The fine-tuned LLM will learn to generate these AI messages. ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.utils import ( map_ai_messages, merge_chat_runs, ) ``` ```python merged_sessions = merge_chat_runs(chat_sessions) alternating_sessions = list(map_ai_messages(merged_sessions, ""Harry Potter"")) ``` ```python # Now all of Harry Potter\'s messages will take the AI message class # which maps to the \'assistant\' role in OpenAI\'s training format alternating_sessions[0][""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [AIMessage(content=""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""What is it, Potter? I\'m quite busy at the moment."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Severus Snape\'}, example=False), AIMessage(content=""I apologize for the interruption, sir. I\'ll be brief. I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False)] ``` #### Now we can convert to OpenAI format dictionaries ```python from langchain.adapters.openai import convert_messages_for_finetuning ``` ```python training_data = convert_messages_for_finetuning(alternating_sessions) print(f""Prepared {len(training_data)} dialogues for training"") ``` ```text Prepared 9 dialogues for training ``` ```python training_data[0][:3] ``` ```text [{\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately.""}, {\'role\': \'user\', \'content\': ""What is it, Potter? I\'m quite busy at the moment.""}, {\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""I apologize for the interruption, sir. I\'ll be brief. I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister.""}] ``` OpenAI currently requires at least 10 training examples for a fine-tuning job, though they recommend between 50-100 for most tasks. Since we only have 9 chat sessions, we can subdivide them (optionally with some overlap) so that each training example is comprised of a portion of a whole conversation. Facebook chat sessions (1 per person) often span multiple days and conversations, so the long-range dependencies may not be that important to model anyhow. ```python # Our chat is alternating, we will make each datapoint a group of 8 messages, # with 2 messages overlapping chunk_size = 8 overlap = 2 training_examples = [ conversation_messages[i : i + chunk_size] for conversation_messages in training_data for i in range(0, len(conversation_messages) - chunk_size + 1, chunk_size - overlap) ] len(training_examples) ``` ```text 100 ``` ## 4. Fine-tune the model It\'s time to fine-tune the model. Make sure you have `openai` installed and have set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` appropriately ```python # %pip install -U openai --quiet ``` ```python import json import time from io import BytesIO import openai # We will write the jsonl file in memory my_file = BytesIO() for m in training_examples: my_file.write((json.dumps({""messages"": m}) + ""\\n"").encode(""utf-8"")) my_file.seek(0) training_file = openai.File.create(file=my_file, purpose=""fine-tune"") # OpenAI audits each training file for compliance reasons. # This make take a few minutes status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""processed"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status print(f""File {training_file.id} ready after {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds."") ``` ```text File file-zCyNBeg4snpbBL7VkvsuhCz8 ready afer 30.55 seconds. ``` With the file ready, it\'s time to kick off a training job. ```python job = openai.FineTuningJob.create( training_file=training_file.id, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) ``` Grab a cup of tea while your model is being prepared. This may take some time! ```python status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""succeeded"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) job = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id) status = job.status ``` ```text Status=[running]... 908.87s ``` ```python print(job.fine_tuned_model) ``` ```text ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::7rDwkaOq ``` ## 5. Use in LangChain You can use the resulting model ID directly the `ChatOpenAI` model class. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI model = ChatOpenAI( model=job.fine_tuned_model, temperature=1, ) ``` ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) chain = prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python for tok in chain.stream({""input"": ""What classes are you taking?""}): print(tok, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text The usual - Potions, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts.

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved. I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now. It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue it\'s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables. My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\'ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use! I didn\'t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+.

    tools,
    ChatOpenAI(temperature=0),
    agent=AgentType.CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
    handle_parsing_errors=True,  # Enable default error handling

An action can either be using a tool and observing its output, or returning a response to the user. Here are the agents available in LangChain. ## Zero-shot ReAct This agent uses the [ReAct]( framework to determine which tool to use based solely on the tool's description. Any number of tools can be provided. This agent requires that a description is provided for each tool. **Note**: This is the most general purpose action agent. ## Structured input ReAct The structured tool chat agent is capable of using multi-input tools. Older agents are configured to specify an action input as a single string, but this agent can use a tools' argument schema to create a structured action input. This is useful for more complex tool usage, like precisely navigating around a browser. ## OpenAI Functions Certain OpenAI models (like gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613) have been explicitly fine-tuned to detect when a function should be called and respond with the inputs that should be passed to the function. The OpenAI Functions Agent is designed to work with these models. ## Conversational This agent is designed to be used in conversational settings. The prompt is designed to make the agent helpful and conversational. It uses the ReAct framework to decide which tool to use, and uses memory to remember the previous conversation interactions. ## Self-ask with search This agent utilizes a single tool that should be named `Intermediate Answer`. This tool should be able to look up factual answers to questions. This agent is equivalent to the original [self-ask with search paper]( where a Google search API was provided as the tool. ## ReAct document store This agent uses the ReAct framework to interact with a docstore. Two tools must be provided: a `Search` tool and a `Lookup` tool (they must be named exactly as so). The `Search` tool should search for a document, while the `Lookup` tool should look up a term in the most recently found document. This agent is equivalent to the original [ReAct paper]( specifically the Wikipedia example. - [Zero-shot ReAct](#zero-shot-react) - [Structured input ReAct](#structured-input-react) - [OpenAI Functions](#openai-functions) - [Conversational](#conversational) - [Self-ask with search](#self-ask-with-search) - [ReAct document store](#react-document-store)"", ""langchain.agents.agent_types.AgentType LangChain 0.0.337 API Experimental Python Docs Toggle Menu PrevUp Next LangChain 0.0.337 langchain.agents.agent_types.AgentType langchain.agents.agent_types.AgentType class langchain.agents.agent_types.AgentType(value, names=None, *, module=None, qualname=None, type=None, start=1, boundary=None)[source] An enum for agent types.

In this example, you will make a simple trajectory evaluator that uses an LLM to determine if any actions were unnecessary. ```python from typing import Any, Optional, Sequence, Tuple from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.evaluation import AgentTrajectoryEvaluator from langchain.schema import AgentAction class StepNecessityEvaluator(AgentTrajectoryEvaluator): """"""Evaluate the perplexity of a predicted string."""""" def __init__(self) -> None: llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"", temperature=0.0) template = """"""Are any of the following steps unnecessary in answering {input}?

It returns the string \'decision\' as the \'value\', and includes the rest of the generated text as \'reasoning\' to let you audit the decision. You can call this evaluator to grade the intermediate steps of your agent\'s trajectory. ```python evaluator = StepNecessityEvaluator() evaluator.evaluate_agent_trajectory( prediction=""The answer is pi"", input=""What is today?"", agent_trajectory=[ ( AgentAction(tool=""ask"", tool_input=""What is today?"", log=""""), ""tomorrow\'s yesterday"", ), ( AgentAction(tool=""check_tv"", tool_input=""Watch tv for half hour"", log=""""), ""bzzz"", ), ], ) ``` ```text {\'score\': 1, \'value\': \'Y\', \'reasoning\': \'Y\'} ```', 'Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) | Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) []( ## Overview ### What is RAG? RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer: ``` We\'ll use the [LCEL Runnable]( protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box ```python from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python for chunk in rag_chain.stream(""What is Task Decomposition?""): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Task decomposition can be performed by AI models with prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ### Go deeper #### Choosing LLMs `ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model wrapper.

There are two main things we need to do to support this. 1. Add a messages placeholder to our chain which allows us to pass in historical messages 2. Add a chain that takes the latest user query and reformulates it in the context of the chat history into a standalone question that can be passed to our retriever. Let\'s start with 2. We can build a ""condense question"" chain that looks something like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder condense_q_system_prompt = """"""Given a chat history and the latest user question \\ which might reference the chat history, formulate a standalone question \\ which can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \\ just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."""""" condense_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", condense_q_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) condense_q_chain = condense_q_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""What is meant by large"", } ) ``` ```text \'What is the definition of ""large"" in the context of a language model?\' ``` ```python condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""How do transformers work"", } ) ``` ```text \'How do transformer models function?\' ``` And now we can build our full QA chain.

This interface will allow us to query our database using LangChain, automatically creating the required graph schema for generating Cypher queries through LLM. ```python graph = MemgraphGraph(url=""bolt://localhost:7687"", username="""", password="""") ``` If necessary, you can manually refresh the graph schema as follows. ```python graph.refresh_schema() ``` To familiarize yourself with the data and verify the updated graph schema, you can print it using the following statement. ```python print(graph.schema) ``` ```text Node properties are the following: Node name: \'Game\', Node properties: [{\'property\': \'name\', \'type\': \'str\'}] Node name: \'Platform\', Node properties: [{\'property\': \'name\', \'type\': \'str\'}] Node name: \'Genre\', Node properties: [{\'property\': \'name\', \'type\': \'str\'}] Node name: \'Publisher\', Node properties: [{\'property\': \'name\', \'type\': \'str\'}] Relationship properties are the following: The relationships are the following: [\'(:Game)-[:AVAILABLE_ON]->(:Platform)\'] [\'(:Game)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(:Genre)\'] [\'(:Game)-[:PUBLISHED_BY]->(:Publisher)\'] ``` ## Querying the database To interact with the OpenAI API, you must configure your API key as an environment variable using the Python [os]( package. This ensures proper authorization for your requests. You can find more information on obtaining your API key [here]( ```python os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = ""your-key-here"" ``` You should create the graph chain using the following script, which will be utilized in the question-answering process based on your graph data. While it defaults to GPT-3.5-turbo, you might also consider experimenting with other models like [GPT-4]( for notably improved Cypher queries and outcomes. We\'ll utilize the OpenAI chat, utilizing the key you previously configured. We\'ll set the temperature to zero, ensuring predictable and consistent answers. Additionally, we\'ll use our Memgraph-LangChain graph and set the verbose parameter, which defaults to False, to True to receive more detailed messages regarding query generation. ```python chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm( ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), graph=graph, verbose=True, model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"" ) ``` Now you can start asking questions! ```python response = chain.run(""Which platforms is Baldur\'s Gate 3 available on?"") print(response) ``` ```text > Entering new GraphCypherQAChain chain... Generated Cypher: MATCH (g:Game {name: \'Baldur\\\'s Gate 3\'})-[:AVAILABLE_ON]->(p:Platform) RETURN p.name Full Context: [{\'p.name\': \'PlayStation 5\'}, {\'p.name\': \'Mac OS\'}, {\'p.name\': \'Windows\'}, {\'p.name\': \'Xbox Series X/S\'}] > Finished chain. Baldur\'s Gate 3 is available on PlayStation 5, Mac OS, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S. ``` ```python response = chain.run(""Is Baldur\'s Gate 3 available on Windows?"") print(response) ``` ```text > Entering new GraphCypherQAChain chain...

Yes, Baldur\'s Gate 3 is available on Windows. ``` ## Chain modifiers To modify the behavior of your chain and obtain more context or additional information, you can modify the chain\'s parameters. #### Return direct query results The `return_direct` modifier specifies whether to return the direct results of the executed Cypher query or the processed natural language response. ```python # Return the result of querying the graph directly chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm( ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), graph=graph, verbose=True, return_direct=True ) ``` ```python response = chain.run(""Which studio published Baldur\'s Gate 3?"") print(response) ``` ```text > Entering new GraphCypherQAChain chain... Generated Cypher: MATCH (:Game {name: \'Baldur\\\'s Gate 3\'})-[:PUBLISHED_BY]->(p:Publisher) RETURN p.name > Finished chain. [{\'p.name\': \'Larian Studios\'}] ``` #### Return query intermediate steps The `return_intermediate_steps` chain modifier enhances the returned response by including the intermediate steps of the query in addition to the initial query result. ```python # Return all the intermediate steps of query execution chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm( ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), graph=graph, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True ) ``` ```python response = chain(""Is Baldur\'s Gate 3 an Adventure game?"") print(f""Intermediate steps: {response[\'intermediate_steps\']}"") print(f""Final response: {response[\'result\']}"") ``` ```text > Entering new GraphCypherQAChain chain... Generated Cypher: MATCH (g:Game {name: \'Baldur\\\'s Gate 3\'})-[:HAS_GENRE]->(genre:Genre {name: \'Adventure\'}) RETURN g, genre Full Context: [{\'g\': {\'name\': ""Baldur\'s Gate 3""}, \'genre\': {\'name\': \'Adventure\'}}] > Finished chain. Intermediate steps: [{\'query\': ""MATCH (g:Game {name: \'Baldur\\\\\'s Gate 3\'})-[:HAS_GENRE]->(genre:Genre {name: \'Adventure\'})\\nRETURN g, genre""}, {\'context\': [{\'g\': {\'name\': ""Baldur\'s Gate 3""}, \'genre\': {\'name\': \'Adventure\'}}]}] Final response: Yes, Baldur\'s Gate 3 is an Adventure game. ``` #### Limit the number of query results The `top_k` modifier can be used when you want to restrict the maximum number of query results. ```python # Limit the maximum number of results returned by query chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm( ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), graph=graph, verbose=True, top_k=2 ) ``` ```python response = chain.run(""What genres are associated with Baldur\'s Gate 3?"") print(response) ``` ```text > Entering new GraphCypherQAChain chain... Generated Cypher: MATCH (:Game {name: \'Baldur\\\'s Gate 3\'})-[:HAS_GENRE]->(g:Genre) RETURN g.name Full Context: [{\'g.name\': \'Adventure\'}, {\'g.name\': \'Role-Playing Game\'}] > Finished chain. Baldur\'s Gate 3 is associated with the genres Adventure and Role-Playing Game. ``` # Advanced querying As the complexity of your solution grows, you might encounter different use-cases that require careful handling. Ensuring your application\'s scalability is essential to maintain a smooth user flow without any hitches. Let\'s instantiate our chain once again and attempt to ask some questions that users might potentially ask. ```python chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm( ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), graph=graph, verbose=True, model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"" ) ``` ```python response = chain.run(""Is Baldur\'s Gate 3 available on PS5?"") print(response) ``` ```text > Entering new GraphCypherQAChain chain... Generated Cypher: MATCH (g:Game {name: \'Baldur\\\'s Gate 3\'})-[:AVAILABLE_ON]->(p:Platform {name: \'PS5\'}) RETURN g.name, p.name Full Context: [] > Finished chain. I\'m sorry, but I don\'t have the information to answer your question. ``` The generated Cypher query looks fine, but we didn\'t receive any information in response. This illustrates a common challenge when working with LLMs - the misalignment between how users phrase queries and how data is stored. In this case, the difference between user perception and the actual data storage can cause mismatches. Prompt refinement, the process of honing the model\'s prompts to better grasp these distinctions, is an efficient solution that tackles this issue. Through prompt refinement, the model gains increased proficiency in generating precise and pertinent queries, leading to the successful retrieval of the desired data. ### Prompt refinement To address this, we can adjust the initial Cypher prompt of the QA chain. This involves adding guidance to the LLM on how users can refer to specific platforms, such as PS5 in our case. We achieve this using the LangChain [PromptTemplate]( creating a modified initial prompt. This modified prompt is then supplied as an argument to our refined Memgraph-LangChain instance. ```python CYPHER_GENERATION_TEMPLATE = """""" Task:Generate Cypher statement to query a graph database. Instructions: Use only the provided relationship types and properties in the schema. Do not use any other relationship types or properties that are not provided. Schema: {schema} Note: Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses. Do not respond to any questions that might ask anything else than for you to construct a Cypher statement. Do not include any text except the generated Cypher statement. If the user asks about PS5, Play Station 5 or PS 5, that is the platform called PlayStation 5. The question is: {question} """""" CYPHER_GENERATION_PROMPT = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""schema"", ""question""], template=CYPHER_GENERATION_TEMPLATE ) ``` ```python chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm( ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), cypher_prompt=CYPHER_GENERATION_PROMPT, graph=graph, verbose=True, model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) ``` ```python response = chain.run(""Is Baldur\'s Gate 3 available on PS5?"") print(response) ``` ```text > Entering new GraphCypherQAChain chain... Generated Cypher: MATCH (g:Game {name: \'Baldur\\\'s Gate 3\'})-[:AVAILABLE_ON]->(p:Platform {name: \'PlayStation 5\'}) RETURN g.name, p.name Full Context: [{\'g.name\': ""Baldur\'s Gate 3"", \'p.name\': \'PlayStation 5\'}] > Finished chain. Yes, Baldur\'s Gate 3 is available on PlayStation 5. ``` Now, with the revised initial Cypher prompt that includes guidance on platform naming, we are obtaining accurate and relevant results that align more closely with user queries. This approach allows for further improvement of your QA chain. You can effortlessly integrate extra prompt refinement data into your chain, thereby enhancing the overall user experience of your app. - [Populating the database](#populating-the-database) - [Refresh graph schema](#refresh-graph-schema) - [Querying the database](#querying-the-database) - [Chain modifiers](#chain-modifiers)- [Prompt refinement](#prompt-refinement)']","Intermediate steps in LangChain refer to the various stages or components involved in a chain of operations, typically used for building complex workflows.

55,im getting a rate limit error for my llm - how do I have it automatically go to a different model?,"['Fallbacks | Fallbacks When working with language models, you may often encounter issues from the underlying APIs, whether these be rate limiting or downtime. Therefore, as you go to move your LLM applications into production it becomes more and more important to safeguard against these. That\'s why we\'ve introduced the concept of fallbacks. A **fallback** is an alternative plan that may be used in an emergency. Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. This is important because often times different models require different prompts. So if your call to OpenAI fails, you don\'t just want to send the same prompt to Anthropic - you probably want to use a different prompt template and send a different version there. ## Fallback for LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things. Therefore, using fallbacks can help protect against these types of things. IMPORTANT: By default, a lot of the LLM wrappers catch errors and retry. You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying and not failing. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI ``` First, let\'s mock out what happens if we hit a RateLimitError from OpenAI ```python from unittest.mock import patch from openai.error import RateLimitError ``` ```python # Note that we set max_retries = 0 to avoid retrying on RateLimits, etc openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0) anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic() llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm]) ``` ```python # Let\'s use just the OpenAI LLm first, to show that we run into an error with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(openai_llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ```python # Now let\'s try with fallbacks to Anthropic with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content=\' I don\\\'t actually know why the chicken crossed the road, but here are some possible humorous answers:\\n\\n- To get to the other side!\\n\\n- It was too chicken to just stand there. \\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\n- It wanted to show the possum it could be done.\\n\\n- It was on its way to a poultry farmers\\\' convention.\\n\\nThe joke plays on the double meaning of ""the other side"" - literally crossing the road to the other side, or the ""other side"" meaning the afterlife. So it\\\'s an anti-joke, with a silly or unexpected pun as the answer.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` We can use our ""LLM with Fallbacks"" as we would a normal LLM. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content="" I don\'t actually know why the kangaroo crossed the road, but I can take a guess! Here are some possible reasons:\\n\\n- To get to the other side (the classic joke answer!)\\n\\n- It was trying to find some food or water \\n\\n- It was trying to find a mate during mating season\\n\\n- It was fleeing from a predator or perceived threat\\n\\n- It was disoriented and crossed accidentally \\n\\n- It was following a herd of other kangaroos who were crossing\\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery or environment \\n\\n- It was trying to reach a new habitat or territory\\n\\nThe real reason is unknown without more context, but hopefully one of those potential explanations does the joke justice! Let me know if you have any other animal jokes I can try to decipher."" additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback for Sequences We can also create fallbacks for sequences, that are sequences themselves. Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model). Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt. ```python # First let\'s create a chain with a ChatModel # We add in a string output parser here so the outputs between the two are the same type from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) # Here we\'re going to use a bad model name to easily create a chain that will error chat_model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"") bad_chain = chat_prompt | chat_model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python # Now lets create a chain with the normal OpenAI model from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = """"""Instructions: You should always include a compliment in your response. Question: Why did the {animal} cross the road?"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template) llm = OpenAI() good_chain = prompt | llm ``` ```python # We can now create a final chain which combines the two chain = bad_chain.with_fallbacks([good_chain]) chain.invoke({""animal"": ""turtle""}) ``` ```text \'\\n\\nAnswer: The turtle crossed the road to get to the other side, and I have to say he had some impressive determination.\' ``` ## Fallback for Long Inputs One of the big limiting factors of LLMs is their context window. Usually, you can count and track the length of prompts before sending them to an LLM, but in situations where that is hard/complicated, you can fallback to a model with a longer context length. ```python short_llm = ChatOpenAI() long_llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"") llm = short_llm.with_fallbacks([long_llm]) ``` ```python inputs = ""What is the next number: "" + "", "".join([""one"", ""two""] * 3000) ``` ```python try: print(short_llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text This model\'s maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 12012 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages. ``` ```python try: print(llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text content=\'The next number in the sequence is two.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback to Better Model Often times we ask models to output format in a specific format (like JSON). Models like GPT-3.5 can do this okay, but sometimes struggle. This naturally points to fallbacks - we can try with GPT-3.5 (faster, cheaper), but then if parsing fails we can use GPT-4. ```python from langchain.output_parsers import DatetimeOutputParser ``` ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template( ""what time was {event} (in %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ format - only return this value)"" ) ``` ```python # In this case we are going to do the fallbacks on the LLM + output parser level # Because the error will get raised in the OutputParser openai_35 = ChatOpenAI() | DatetimeOutputParser() openai_4 = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"") | DatetimeOutputParser() ``` ```python only_35 = prompt | openai_35 fallback_4 = prompt | openai_35.with_fallbacks([openai_4]) ``` ```python try: print(only_35.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text Error: Could not parse datetime string: The Super Bowl in 1994 took place on January 30th at 3:30 PM local time. Converting this to the specified format (%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ) results in: 1994-01-30T15:30:00.000Z ``` ```python try: print(fallback_4.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text 1994-01-30 15:30:00 ``` - [Fallback for LLM API Errors](#fallback-for-llm-api-errors) - [Fallback for Sequences](#fallback-for-sequences) - [Fallback for Long Inputs](#fallback-for-long-inputs) - [Fallback to Better Model](#fallback-to-better-model)', 'Reddit | Reddit [Reddit]( is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website.

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered ""controversial"" I really had to see this for myself.The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life.

While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema.

I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York.

It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent.

Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He\\\'s small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS\\\' American Masters: Finding Lucy.

Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat\\\'s-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple\\\'s respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich\\\'s daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on \\\'love\\\' while observing their parents.

Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie\\\'s title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20\\\'s may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. ""They All Laughed"" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn\\\'t prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there\\\'s no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten\\\'s scenes.

The process is simple and comprises 3 steps. 1. Select the LLM runs to train on. 2. Use the LangSmithRunChatLoader to load runs as chat sessions. 3. Fine-tune your model. Then you can use the fine-tuned model in your LangChain app. Before diving in, let\'s install our prerequisites. ## Prerequisites Ensure you\'ve installed langchain >= 0.0.311 and have configured your environment with your LangSmith API key. ```python %pip install -U langchain openai ``` ```python import os import uuid uid = uuid.uuid4().hex[:6] project_name = f""Run Fine-tuning Walkthrough {uid}"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = ""YOUR API KEY"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_PROJECT""] = project_name ``` ## 1. Select Runs The first step is selecting which runs to fine-tune on. A common case would be to select LLM runs within traces that have received positive user feedback. You can find examples of this in the[LangSmith Cookbook]( and in the [docs]( For the sake of this tutorial, we will generate some runs for you to use here. Let\'s try fine-tuning a simple function-calling chain. ```python from enum import Enum from langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field class Operation(Enum): add = ""+"" subtract = ""-"" multiply = ""*"" divide = ""/"" class Calculator(BaseModel): """"""A calculator function"""""" num1: float num2: float operation: Operation = Field(..., description=""+,-,*,/"") def calculate(self): if self.operation == Operation.add: return self.num1 + self.num2 elif self.operation == Operation.subtract: return self.num1 - self.num2 elif self.operation == Operation.multiply: return self.num1 * self.num2 elif self.operation == Operation.divide: if self.num2 != 0: return self.num1 / self.num2 else: return ""Cannot divide by zero"" ``` ```python from pprint import pprint from langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel from langchain.utils.openai_functions import convert_pydantic_to_openai_function openai_function_def = convert_pydantic_to_openai_function(Calculator) pprint(openai_function_def) ``` ```text {\'description\': \'A calculator function\', \'name\': \'Calculator\', \'parameters\': {\'description\': \'A calculator function\', \'properties\': {\'num1\': {\'title\': \'Num1\', \'type\': \'number\'}, \'num2\': {\'title\': \'Num2\', \'type\': \'number\'}, \'operation\': {\'allOf\': [{\'description\': \'An \' \'enumeration.\', \'enum\': [\'+\', \'-\', \'*\', \'/\'], \'title\': \'Operation\'}], \'description\': \'+,-,*,/\'}}, \'required\': [\'num1\', \'num2\', \'operation\'], \'title\': \'Calculator\', \'type\': \'object\'}} ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.output_parsers.openai_functions import PydanticOutputFunctionsParser from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are an accounting assistant.""), (""user"", ""{input}""), ] ) chain = ( prompt | ChatOpenAI().bind(functions=[openai_function_def]) | PydanticOutputFunctionsParser(pydantic_schema=Calculator) | (lambda x: x.calculate()) ) ``` ```python math_questions = [ ""What\'s 45/9?"", ""What\'s 81/9?"", ""What\'s 72/8?"", ""What\'s 56/7?"", ""What\'s 36/6?"", ""What\'s 64/8?"", ""What\'s 12*6?"", ""What\'s 8*8?"", ""What\'s 10*10?"", ""What\'s 11*11?"", ""What\'s 13*13?"", ""What\'s 45+30?"", ""What\'s 72+28?"", ""What\'s 56+44?"", ""What\'s 63+37?"", ""What\'s 70-35?"", ""What\'s 60-30?"", ""What\'s 50-25?"", ""What\'s 40-20?"", ""What\'s 30-15?"", ] results = chain.batch([{""input"": q} for q in math_questions], return_exceptions=True) ``` ```text Retrying langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI.completion_with_retry.._completion_with_retry in 4.0 seconds as it raised ServiceUnavailableError: The server is overloaded or not ready yet.. ``` #### Load runs that did not error Now we can select the successful runs to fine-tune on. ```python from langsmith.client import Client client = Client() ``` ```python successful_traces = { run.trace_id for run in client.list_runs( project_name=project_name, execution_order=1, error=False, ) } llm_runs = [ run for run in client.list_runs( project_name=project_name, run_type=""llm"", ) if run.trace_id in successful_traces ] ``` ## 2. Prepare data Now we can create an instance of LangSmithRunChatLoader and load the chat sessions using its lazy_load() method. ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.langsmith import LangSmithRunChatLoader loader = LangSmithRunChatLoader(runs=llm_runs) chat_sessions = loader.lazy_load() ``` #### With the chat sessions loaded, convert them into a format suitable for fine-tuning. ```python from langchain.adapters.openai import convert_messages_for_finetuning training_data = convert_messages_for_finetuning(chat_sessions) ``` ## 3. Fine-tune the model Now, initiate the fine-tuning process using the OpenAI library. ```python import json import time from io import BytesIO import openai my_file = BytesIO() for dialog in training_data: my_file.write((json.dumps({""messages"": dialog}) + ""\\n"").encode(""utf-8"")) my_file.seek(0) training_file = openai.File.create(file=my_file, purpose=""fine-tune"") job = openai.FineTuningJob.create( training_file=training_file.id, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) # Wait for the fine-tuning to complete (this may take some time) status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""succeeded"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status # Now your model is fine-tuned! ``` ```text Status=[running]... 346.26s. 31.70s ``` ## 4. Use in LangChain After fine-tuning, use the resulting model ID with the ChatOpenAI model class in your LangChain app. ```python # Get the fine-tuned model ID job = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id) model_id = job.fine_tuned_model # Use the fine-tuned model in LangChain model = ChatOpenAI( model=model_id, temperature=1, ) ``` ```python (prompt | model).invoke({""input"": ""What\'s 56/7?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'{\\n ""num1"": 56,\\n ""num2"": 7,\\n ""operation"": ""/""\\n}\') ``` Now you have successfully fine-tuned a model using data from LangSmith LLM runs! - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) - [1.

An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API currently supports three types of tools: Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function calling You can interact with OpenAI Assistants using OpenAI tools or custom tools. When using exclusively OpenAI tools, you can just invoke the assistant directly and get final answers. When using custom tools, you can run the assistant and tool execution loop using the built-in AgentExecutor or easily write your own executor. Below we show the different ways to interact with Assistants. As a simple example, let\'s build a math tutor that can write and run code. ### Using only OpenAI tools ```python from langchain.agents.openai_assistant import OpenAIAssistantRunnable ``` ```python interpreter_assistant = OpenAIAssistantRunnable.create_assistant( name=""langchain assistant"", instructions=""You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions."", tools=[{""type"": ""code_interpreter""}], model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"", ) output = interpreter_assistant.invoke({""content"": ""What\'s 10 - 4 raised to the 2.7""}) output ``` ```text [ThreadMessage(id=\'msg_qgxkD5kvkZyl0qOaL4czPFkZ\', assistant_id=\'asst_0T8S7CJuUa4Y4hm1PF6n62v7\', content=[MessageContentText(text=Text(annotations=[], value=\'The result of the calculation \\\\(10 - 4^{2.7}\\\\) is approximately \\\\(-32.224\\\\).\'), type=\'text\')], created_at=1700169519, file_ids=[], metadata={}, object=\'thread.message\', role=\'assistant\', run_id=\'run_aH3ZgSWNk3vYIBQm3vpE8tr4\', thread_id=\'thread_9K6cYfx1RBh0pOWD8SxwVWW9\')] ``` ### As a LangChain agent with arbitrary tools Now let\'s recreate this functionality using our own tools. For this example we\'ll use the [E2B sandbox runtime tool]( ```bash pip install e2b duckduckgo-search ``` ```python import getpass from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun, E2BDataAnalysisTool tools = [E2BDataAnalysisTool(api_key=getpass.getpass()), DuckDuckGoSearchRun()] ``` ```python agent = OpenAIAssistantRunnable.create_assistant( name=""langchain assistant e2b tool"", instructions=""You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions. You can also search the internet."", tools=tools, model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"", as_agent=True, ) ``` #### Using AgentExecutor The OpenAIAssistantRunnable is compatible with the AgentExecutor, so we can pass it in as an agent directly to the executor. The AgentExecutor handles calling the invoked tools and uploading the tool outputs back to the Assistants API. Plus it comes with built-in LangSmith tracing. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools) agent_executor.invoke({""content"": ""What\'s the weather in SF today divided by 2.7""}) ``` ```text {\'content\': ""What\'s the weather in SF today divided by 2.7"", \'output\': ""The search results indicate that the weather in San Francisco is 67 F.

You can access your database in SQL and also from here, LangChain. `MyScale` can make use of [various data types and functions for filters]( It will boost up your LLM app no matter if you are scaling up your data or expand your system to broader application. In the notebook, we\'ll demo the `SelfQueryRetriever` wrapped around a `MyScale` vector store with some extra pieces we contributed to LangChain. In short, it can be condensed into 4 points: 1. Add `contain` comparator to match the list of any if there is more than one element matched 2. Add `timestamp` data type for datetime match (ISO-format, or YYYY-MM-DD) 3. Add `like` comparator for string pattern search 4. Add arbitrary function capability ## Creating a MyScale vector store MyScale has already been integrated to LangChain for a while. So you can follow [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/myscale) to create your own vectorstore for a self-query retriever. **Note:** All self-query retrievers requires you to have `lark` installed (`pip install lark`). We use `lark` for grammar definition. Before you proceed to the next step, we also want to remind you that `clickhouse-connect` is also needed to interact with your MyScale backend. ```bash pip install lark clickhouse-connect ``` In this tutorial we follow other example\'s setting and use `OpenAIEmbeddings`. Remember to get an OpenAI API Key for valid access to LLMs. ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") os.environ[""MYSCALE_HOST""] = getpass.getpass(""MyScale URL:"") os.environ[""MYSCALE_PORT""] = getpass.getpass(""MyScale Port:"") os.environ[""MYSCALE_USERNAME""] = getpass.getpass(""MyScale Username:"") os.environ[""MYSCALE_PASSWORD""] = getpass.getpass(""MyScale Password:"") ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import Document from langchain.vectorstores import MyScale embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ## Create some sample data As you can see, the data we created has some differences compared to other self-query retrievers. We replaced the keyword `year` with `date` which gives you finer control on timestamps. We also changed the type of the keyword `gerne` to a list of strings, where an LLM can use a new `contain` comparator to construct filters. We also provide the `like` comparator and arbitrary function support to filters, which will be introduced in next few cells. Now let\'s look at the data first. ```python docs = [ Document( page_content=""A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose"", metadata={""date"": ""1993-07-02"", ""rating"": 7.7, ""genre"": [""science fiction""]}, ), Document( page_content=""Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ..."", metadata={""date"": ""2010-12-30"", ""director"": ""Christopher Nolan"", ""rating"": 8.2}, ), Document( page_content=""A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea"", metadata={""date"": ""2006-04-23"", ""director"": ""Satoshi Kon"", ""rating"": 8.6}, ), Document( page_content=""A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them"", metadata={""date"": ""2019-08-22"", ""director"": ""Greta Gerwig"", ""rating"": 8.3}, ), Document( page_content=""Toys come alive and have a blast doing so"", metadata={""date"": ""1995-02-11"", ""genre"": [""animated""]}, ), Document( page_content=""Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone"", metadata={ ""date"": ""1979-09-10"", ""director"": ""Andrei Tarkovsky"", ""genre"": [""science fiction"", ""adventure""], ""rating"": 9.9, }, ), ] vectorstore = MyScale.from_documents( docs, embeddings, ) ``` ## Creating our self-querying retriever Just like other retrievers... simple and nice. ```python from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever metadata_field_info = [ AttributeInfo( name=""genre"", description=""The genres of the movie"", type=""list[string]"", ), # If you want to include length of a list, just define it as a new column # This will teach the LLM to use it as a column when constructing filter.

We can do this by passing `enable_limit=True` to the constructor. ```python retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm( llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, enable_limit=True, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python # This example only specifies a relevant query retriever.get_relevant_documents(""what are two movies about dinosaurs"") ``` - [Creating a MyScale vector store](#creating-a-myscale-vector-store) - [Create some sample data](#create-some-sample-data) - [Creating our self-querying retriever](#creating-our-self-querying-retriever) - [Testing it out with self-query retriever\'s existing functionalities](#testing-it-out-with-self-query-retrievers-existing-functionalities) - [Filter k](#filter-k)']","Function calling in LangChain refers to the ability to define a Pydantic model and convert it into an OpenAPI function definition, which can then be used by language models to understand and execute specific functions.

This is useful any time your data has a strong time-based component. Some examples of such data are: - News articles (politics, business, etc) - Blog posts, documentation or other published material (public or private). - Social media posts - Changelogs of any kind - Messages Such items are often searched by both similarity and time. For example: Show me all news about Toyota trucks from 2022. [Timescale Vector]( provides superior performance when searching for embeddings within a particular timeframe by leveraging automatic table partitioning to isolate data for particular time-ranges. Langchain\'s self-query retriever allows deducing time-ranges (as well as other search criteria) from the text of user queries. ## What is Timescale Vector? **Timescale Vector is PostgreSQL++ for AI applications.** Timescale Vector enables you to efficiently store and query billions of vector embeddings in `PostgreSQL`. - Enhances `pgvector` with faster and more accurate similarity search on 1B+ vectors via DiskANN inspired indexing algorithm. - Enables fast time-based vector search via automatic time-based partitioning and indexing. - Provides a familiar SQL interface for querying vector embeddings and relational data.

It is a lightweight wrapper around the vector store class to make it conform to the retriever interface. It uses the search methods implemented by a vector store, like similarity search and MMR, to query the texts in the vector store. Once you construct a vector store, it\'s very easy to construct a retriever. Let\'s walk through an example. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader loader = TextLoader(\'../../../state_of_the_union.txt\') ``` ```python from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() db = FAISS.from_documents(texts, embeddings) ``` ```text Exiting: Cleaning up .chroma directory ``` ```python retriever = db.as_retriever() ``` ```python docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(""what did he say about ketanji brown jackson"") ``` ## Maximum marginal relevance retrieval By default, the vector store retriever uses similarity search.

An essential component of a conversation is being able to refer to information introduced earlier in the conversation. At bare minimum, a conversational system should be able to access some window of past messages directly. A more complex system will need to have a world model that it is constantly updating, which allows it to do things like maintain information about entities and their relationships. We call this ability to store information about past interactions ""memory"". LangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a system. These utilities can be used by themselves or incorporated seamlessly into a chain. A memory system needs to support two basic actions: reading and writing. Recall that every chain defines some core execution logic that expects certain inputs. Some of these inputs come directly from the user, but some of these inputs can come from memory. A chain will interact with its memory system twice in a given run. 1. AFTER receiving the initial user inputs but BEFORE executing the core logic, a chain will READ from its memory system and augment the user inputs. 2. AFTER executing the core logic but BEFORE returning the answer, a chain will WRITE the inputs and outputs of the current run to memory, so that they can be referred to in future runs. ![memory-diagram](/assets/images/memory_diagram-0627c68230aa438f9b5419064d63cbbc.png) ## Building memory into a system The two core design decisions in any memory system are: - How state is stored - How state is queried ### Storing: List of chat messages Underlying any memory is a history of all chat interactions. Even if these are not all used directly, they need to be stored in some form. One of the key parts of the LangChain memory module is a series of integrations for storing these chat messages, from in-memory lists to persistent databases. - [Chat message storage](/docs/modules/memory/chat_messages/): How to work with Chat Messages, and the various integrations offered. ### Querying: Data structures and algorithms on top of chat messages Keeping a list of chat messages is fairly straight-forward. What is less straight-forward are the data structures and algorithms built on top of chat messages that serve a view of those messages that is most useful. A very simply memory system might just return the most recent messages each run. A slightly more complex memory system might return a succinct summary of the past K messages. An even more sophisticated system might extract entities from stored messages and only return information about entities referenced in the current run. Each application can have different requirements for how memory is queried. The memory module should make it easy to both get started with simple memory systems and write your own custom systems if needed. - [Memory types](/docs/modules/memory/types/): The various data structures and algorithms that make up the memory types LangChain supports ## Get started Let\'s take a look at what Memory actually looks like in LangChain. Here we\'ll cover the basics of interacting with an arbitrary memory class. Let\'s take a look at how to use `ConversationBufferMemory` in chains. `ConversationBufferMemory` is an extremely simple form of memory that just keeps a list of chat messages in a buffer and passes those into the prompt template. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` When using memory in a chain, there are a few key concepts to understand. Note that here we cover general concepts that are useful for most types of memory. Each individual memory type may very well have its own parameters and concepts that are necessary to understand. ### What variables get returned from memory Before going into the chain, various variables are read from memory. These have specific names which need to align with the variables the chain expects. You can see what these variables are by calling `memory.load_memory_variables({})`. Note that the empty dictionary that we pass in is just a placeholder for real variables. If the memory type you are using is dependent upon the input variables, you may need to pass some in. ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': ""Human: hi!\\nAI: what\'s up?""} ``` In this case, you can see that `load_memory_variables` returns a single key, `history`. This means that your chain (and likely your prompt) should expect an input named `history`. You can usually control this variable through parameters on the memory class. For example, if you want the memory variables to be returned in the key `chat_history` you can do: ```python memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` ```text {\'chat_history\': ""Human: hi!\\nAI: what\'s up?""} ``` The parameter name to control these keys may vary per memory type, but it\'s important to understand that (1) this is controllable, and (2) how to control it. ### Whether memory is a string or a list of messages One of the most common types of memory involves returning a list of chat messages. These can either be returned as a single string, all concatenated together (useful when they will be passed into LLMs) or a list of ChatMessages (useful when passed into ChatModels). By default, they are returned as a single string. In order to return as a list of messages, you can set `return_messages=True` ```python memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True) memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` ```text {\'history\': [HumanMessage(content=\'hi!\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'what\'s up?\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]} ``` ### What keys are saved to memory Often times chains take in or return multiple input/output keys. In these cases, how can we know which keys we want to save to the chat message history? This is generally controllable by `input_key` and `output_key` parameters on the memory types. These default to `None` - and if there is only one input/output key it is known to just use that. However, if there are multiple input/output keys then you MUST specify the name of which one to use. ### End to end example Finally, let\'s take a look at using this in a chain. We\'ll use an `LLMChain`, and show working with both an LLM and a ChatModel. #### Using an LLM ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) # Notice that ""chat_history"" is present in the prompt template template = """"""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human. Previous conversation: {chat_history} New human question: {question} Response:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template) # Notice that we need to align the `memory_key` memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") conversation = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory ) ``` ```python # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` #### Using a ChatModel ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, ) from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = ChatOpenAI() prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}"") ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name. memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory ) ``` ```python # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ## Next steps And that\'s it for getting started!

58,What's a string evaluator,"['Criteria Evaluation | Criteria Evaluation []( In scenarios where you wish to assess a model\'s output using a specific rubric or criteria set, the `criteria` evaluator proves to be a handy tool. It allows you to verify if an LLM or Chain\'s output complies with a defined set of criteria. To understand its functionality and configurability in depth, refer to the reference documentation of the [CriteriaEvalChain]( class. ### Usage without references In this example, you will use the `CriteriaEvalChain` to check whether an output is concise. First, create the evaluation chain to predict whether outputs are ""concise"". ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", criteria=""conciseness"") # This is equivalent to loading using the enum from langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorType evaluator = load_evaluator(EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'The criterion is conciseness, which means the submission should be brief and to the point. \\n\\nLooking at the submission, the answer to the question ""What\\\'s 2+2?"" is indeed ""four"". However, the respondent has added extra information, stating ""That\\\'s an elementary question."" This statement does not contribute to answering the question and therefore makes the response less concise.\\n\\nTherefore, the submission does not meet the criterion of conciseness.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` #### Output Format All string evaluators expose an [evaluate_strings]( (or async [aevaluate_strings]( method, which accepts: - input (str) The input to the agent. - prediction (str) The predicted response. The criteria evaluators return a dictionary with the following values: - score: Binary integer 0 to 1, where 1 would mean that the output is compliant with the criteria, and 0 otherwise - value: A ""Y"" or ""N"" corresponding to the score - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Using Reference Labels Some criteria (such as correctness) require reference labels to work correctly. To do this, initialize the `labeled_criteria` evaluator and call the evaluator with a `reference` string. ```python evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"") # We can even override the model\'s learned knowledge using ground truth labels eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( input=""What is the capital of the US?"", prediction=""Topeka, KS"", reference=""The capital of the US is Topeka, KS, where it permanently moved from Washington D.C. on May 16, 2023"", ) print(f\'With ground truth: {eval_result[""score""]}\') ``` ```text With ground truth: 1 ``` **Default Criteria** Most of the time, you\'ll want to define your own custom criteria (see below), but we also provide some common criteria you can load with a single string. Here\'s a list of pre-implemented criteria. Note that in the absence of labels, the LLM merely predicts what it thinks the best answer is and is not grounded in actual law or context. ```python from langchain.evaluation import Criteria # For a list of other default supported criteria, try calling `supported_default_criteria` list(Criteria) ``` ```text [, , , , , , , , , , ] ``` ## Custom Criteria To evaluate outputs against your own custom criteria, or to be more explicit the definition of any of the default criteria, pass in a dictionary of `""criterion_name"": ""criterion_description""` Note: it\'s recommended that you create a single evaluator per criterion. This way, separate feedback can be provided for each aspect. Additionally, if you provide antagonistic criteria, the evaluator won\'t be very useful, as it will be configured to predict compliance for ALL of the criteria provided. ```python custom_criterion = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric or mathematical information?"" } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criterion, ) query = ""Tell me a joke"" prediction = ""I ate some square pie but I don\'t know the square of pi."" eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(eval_result) # If you wanted to specify multiple criteria.

Below, use an anthropic model instead. ```python # %pip install ChatAnthropic # %env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", llm=llm, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2?

Remember when selecting criteria to decide whether they ought to require ground truth labels or not. Things like ""correctness"" are best evaluated with ground truth or with extensive context. Also, remember to pick aligned principles for a given chain so that the classification makes sense. - [Usage without references](#usage-without-references) - [Using Reference Labels](#using-reference-labels) - [Custom Criteria](#custom-criteria) - [Using Constitutional Principles](#using-constitutional-principles) - [Configuring the LLM](#configuring-the-llm) - [Conclusion](#conclusion)', 'Scoring Evaluator | Scoring Evaluator The Scoring Evaluator instructs a language model to assess your model\'s predictions on a specified scale (default is 1-10) based on your custom criteria or rubric.

Before we dive in, please note that any specific grade from an LLM should be taken with a grain of salt. A prediction that receives a scores of ""8"" may not be meaningfully better than one that receives a score of ""7"". ### Usage with Ground Truth For a thorough understanding, refer to the [LabeledScoreStringEvalChain documentation]( Below is an example demonstrating the usage of `LabeledScoreStringEvalChain` using the default prompt: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_score_string"", llm=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"")) ``` ```python # Correct eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""You can find them in the dresser\'s third drawer."", reference=""The socks are in the third drawer in the dresser"", input=""Where are my socks?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The assistant\'s response is helpful, accurate, and directly answers the user\'s question. It correctly refers to the ground truth provided by the user, specifying the exact location of the socks. The response, while succinct, demonstrates depth by directly addressing the user\'s query without unnecessary details. Therefore, the assistant\'s response is highly relevant, correct, and demonstrates depth of thought. \\n\\nRating: [[10]]"", \'score\': 10} ``` When evaluating your app\'s specific context, the evaluator can be more effective if you provide a full rubric of what you\'re looking to grade. Below is an example using accuracy. ```python accuracy_criteria = { ""accuracy"": """""" Score 1: The answer is completely unrelated to the reference. Score 3: The answer has minor relevance but does not align with the reference. Score 5: The answer has moderate relevance but contains inaccuracies. Score 7: The answer aligns with the reference but has minor errors or omissions.

The assistant correctly suggests that the socks are in the dresser, which aligns with the ground truth. However, the assistant failed to specify that the socks are in the third drawer of the dresser.

Therefore, the response is relevant but contains a significant omission. Rating: [[7]]."", \'score\': 0.7} ``` ### Usage without references You can also use a scoring evaluator without reference labels. This is useful if you want to measure a prediction along specific semantic dimensions. Below is an example using ""helpfulness"" and ""harmlessness"" on a single scale. Refer to the documentation of the [ScoreStringEvalChain]( class for full details. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator hh_criteria = { ""helpful"": ""The assistant\'s answer should be helpful to the user."", ""harmless"": ""The assistant\'s answer should not be illegal, harmful, offensive or unethical."", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""score_string"", criteria=hh_criteria) ``` ```python # Helpful but harmful eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""Sure I\'d be happy to help!

This comparison is a crucial step in the evaluation of language models, providing a measure of the accuracy or quality of the generated text. In practice, string evaluators are typically used to evaluate a predicted string against a given input, such as a question or a prompt. Often, a reference label or context string is provided to define what a correct or ideal response would look like. These evaluators can be customized to tailor the evaluation process to fit your application's specific requirements. To create a custom string evaluator, inherit from the `StringEvaluator` class and implement the `_evaluate_strings` method. If you require asynchronous support, also implement the `_aevaluate_strings` method. Here's a summary of the key attributes and methods associated with a string evaluator: - `evaluation_name`: Specifies the name of the evaluation. - `requires_input`: Boolean attribute that indicates whether the evaluator requires an input string. If True, the evaluator will raise an error when the input isn't provided. If False, a warning will be logged if an input _is_ provided, indicating that it will not be considered in the evaluation. - `requires_reference`: Boolean attribute specifying whether the evaluator requires a reference label. If True, the evaluator will raise an error when the reference isn't provided. If False, a warning will be logged if a reference _is_ provided, indicating that it will not be considered in the evaluation. String evaluators also implement the following methods: - `aevaluate_strings`: Asynchronously evaluates the output of the Chain or Language Model, with support for optional input and label. - `evaluate_strings`: Synchronously evaluates the output of the Chain or Language Model, with support for optional input and label.

In addition, for configurable runnables, the playground will allow you to configure the runnable and share a link with the configuration: ### Sharing ![]( ## Legacy Chains LangServe works with both Runnables (constructed via [LangChain Expression Language]( and legacy chains (inheriting from `Chain`). However, some of the input schemas for legacy chains may be incomplete/incorrect, leading to errors. This can be fixed by updating the `input_schema` property of those chains in LangChain. If you encounter any errors, please open an issue on THIS repo, and we will work to address it. ## Deployment ### Deploy to GCP You can deploy to GCP Cloud Run using the following command: ```text gcloud run deploy [your-service-name] --source . --port 8001 --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1 --set-env-vars=OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key ``` ## Pydantic LangServe provides support for Pydantic 2 with some limitations. 1. OpenAPI docs will not be generated for invoke/batch/stream/stream_log when using Pydantic V2. Fast API does not support [mixing pydantic v1 and v2 namespaces] . 2. LangChain uses the v1 namespace in Pydantic v2. Please read the [following guidelines to ensure compatibility with LangChain]( Except for these limitations, we expect the API endpoints, the playground and any other features to work as expected. ## Advanced ## Handling Authentication If you need to add authentication to your server, please reference FastAPI\'s [security documentation]( and [middleware documentation]( ### Files LLM applications often deal with files. There are different architectures that can be made to implement file processing; at a high level: 1. The file may be uploaded to the server via a dedicated endpoint and processed using a separate endpoint 2. The file may be uploaded by either value (bytes of file) or reference (e.g., s3 url to file content) 3. The processing endpoint may be blocking or non-blocking 4. If significant processing is required, the processing may be offloaded to a dedicated process pool You should determine what is the appropriate architecture for your application. Currently, to upload files by value to a runnable, use base64 encoding for the file (`multipart/form-data` is not supported yet). Here\'s an [example]( that shows how to use base64 encoding to send a file to a remote runnable. Remember, you can always upload files by reference (e.g., s3 url) or upload them as multipart/form-data to a dedicated endpoint. ### Custom Input and Output Types Input and Output types are defined on all runnables. You can access them via the `input_schema` and `output_schema` properties. `LangServe` uses these types for validation and documentation. If you want to override the default inferred types, you can use the `with_types` method. Here\'s a toy example to illustrate the idea: ```python from typing import Any from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda app = FastAPI() def func(x: Any) -> int: """"""Mistyped function that should accept an int but accepts anything."""""" return x + 1 runnable = RunnableLambda(func).with_types( input_schema=int, ) add_routes(app, runnable) ``` ### Custom User Types Inherit from `CustomUserType` if you want the data to de-serialize into a pydantic model rather than the equivalent dict representation. At the moment, this type only works _server_ side and is used to specify desired _decoding_ behavior. If inheriting from this type the server will keep the decoded type as a pydantic model instead of converting it into a dict. ```python from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda from langserve import add_routes from langserve.schema import CustomUserType app = FastAPI() class Foo(CustomUserType): bar: int def func(foo: Foo) -> int: """"""Sample function that expects a Foo type which is a pydantic model"""""" assert isinstance(foo, Foo) return foo.bar # Note that the input and output type are automatically inferred! # You do not need to specify them. # runnable = RunnableLambda(func).with_types( # <-- Not needed in this case # input_schema=Foo, # output_schema=int, # add_routes(app, RunnableLambda(func), path=""/foo"") ``` ### Playground Widgets\u200b The playground allows you to define custom widgets for your runnable from the backend. - A widget is specified at the field level and shipped as part of the JSON schema of the input type - A widget must contain a key called `type` with the value being one of a well known list of widgets - Other widget keys will be associated with values that describe paths in a JSON object General schema: ```typescript type JsonPath = number | string | (number | string)[]; type NameSpacedPath = { title: string; path: JsonPath }; // Using title to mimick json schema, but can use namespace type OneOfPath = { oneOf: JsonPath[] }; type Widget = { type: string // Some well known type (e.g., base64file, chat etc.) [key: string]: JsonPath | NameSpacedPath | OneOfPath; }; ``` #### File Upload Widget\u200b Allows creation of a file upload input in the UI playground for files that are uploaded as base64 encoded strings. Here\'s the full [example]( Snippet: ```python try: from pydantic.v1 import Field except ImportError: from pydantic import Field from langserve import CustomUserType # ATTENTION: Inherit from CustomUserType instead of BaseModel otherwise # the server will decode it into a dict instead of a pydantic model. class FileProcessingRequest(CustomUserType): """"""Request including a base64 encoded file."""""" # The extra field is used to specify a widget for the playground UI. file: str = Field(..., extra={""widget"": {""type"": ""base64file""}}) num_chars: int = 100 ``` Example widget: ![]( - [Overview](#overview) - [Features](#features)- [Limitations](#limitations) - [Hosted LangServe](#hosted-langserve) - [Security](#security) - [Installation](#installation) - [LangChain CLI ](#langchain-cli-) - [Examples](#examples)- [Server](#server) - [Docs](#docs) - [Client](#client) - [Endpoints](#endpoints) - [Playground](#playground)- [Widgets](#widgets) - [Sharing](#sharing) - [Legacy Chains](#legacy-chains) - [Deployment](#deployment)- [Deploy to GCP](#deploy-to-gcp) - [Pydantic](#pydantic) - [Advanced](#advanced) - [Handling Authentication](#handling-authentication)- [Files](#files) - [Custom Input and Output Types](#custom-input-and-output-types) - [Custom User Types](#custom-user-types) - [Playground Widgets](#playground-widgets)', 'Map re-rank | Map re-rank The map re-rank documents chain runs an initial prompt on each document, that not only tries to complete a task but also gives a score for how certain it is in its answer.

Another use is for scientific observation, as in a Mssbauer spectrometer.

Small fission reactors for Earth observation satellites, such as the TOPAZ nuclear reactor, have also been flown.[1] A radioisotope heater unit is powered by radioactive decay and can keep components from becoming too cold to function, potentially over a span of decades.[2] The United States tested the SNAP-10A nuclear reactor in space for 43 days in 1965,[3] with the next test of a nuclear reactor power system intended for space use occurring on 13 September 2012 with the Demonstration Using Flattop Fission (DUFF) test of the Kilopower reactor.[4] After a ground-based test of the experimental 1965 Romashka reactor, which used uranium and direct thermoelectric conversion to electricity,[5] the USSR sent about 40 nuclear-electric satellites into space, mostly powered by the BES-5 reactor. The more powerful TOPAZ-II reactor produced 10 kilowatts of electricity.[3] Examples of concepts that use nuclear power for space propulsion systems include the nuclear electric rocket (nuclear powered ion thruster(s)), the radioisotope rocket, and radioisotope electric propulsion (REP).[6] One of the more explored concepts is the nuclear thermal rocket, which was ground tested in the NERVA program. Nuclear pulse propulsion was the subject of Project Orion.[7] Regulation and hazard prevention[edit] After the ban of nuclear weapons in space by the Outer Space Treaty in 1967, nuclear power has been discussed at least since 1972 as a sensitive issue by states.[8] Particularly its potential hazards to Earth\'s environment and thus also humans has prompted states to adopt in the U.N. General Assembly the Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space (1992), particularly introducing safety principles for launches and to manage their traffic.[8] Benefits Both the Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers used RTGs for power on the surface of Mars. (Viking launch vehicle pictured) While solar power is much more commonly used, nuclear power can offer advantages in some areas. Solar cells, although efficient, can only supply energy to spacecraft in orbits where the solar flux is sufficiently high, such as low Earth orbit and interplanetary destinations close enough to the Sun. Unlike solar cells, nuclear power systems function independently of sunlight, which is necessary for deep space exploration. Nuclear-based systems can have less mass than solar cells of equivalent power, allowing more compact spacecraft that are easier to orient and direct in space. In the case of crewed spaceflight, nuclear power concepts that can power both life support and propulsion systems may reduce both cost and flight time.[9] Selected applications and/or technologies for space include: Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Radioisotope heater unit Radioisotope piezoelectric generator Radioisotope rocket Nuclear thermal rocket Nuclear pulse propulsion Nuclear electric rocket """""" docs = [ Document( page_content=split, metadata={""source"": "" ) for split in text.split(""\\n\\n"") ] ``` ```python print( map_rerank_chain.invoke({""docs"": docs, ""question"": ""How were the vikings powered""}) ) ``` ```text The Viking missions were powered by radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs).

In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code). In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order. ## Concepts There are several key components here: ### Agent This is the chain responsible for deciding what step to take next. This is powered by a language model and a prompt. The inputs to this chain are: 1. Tools: Descriptions of available tools 2. User input: The high level objective 3. Intermediate steps: Any (action, tool output) pairs previously executed in order to achieve the user input The output is the next action(s) to take or the final response to send to the user (`AgentAction`s or `AgentFinish`). An action specifies a tool and the input to that tool. Different agents have different prompting styles for reasoning, different ways of encoding inputs, and different ways of parsing the output. For a full list of built-in agents see [agent types](/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/). You can also **easily build custom agents**, which we show how to do in the Get started section below. ### Tools Tools are functions that an agent can invoke. There are two important design considerations around tools: 1. Giving the agent access to the right tools 2. Describing the tools in a way that is most helpful to the agent Without thinking through both, you won\'t be able to build a working agent. If you don\'t give the agent access to a correct set of tools, it will never be able to accomplish the objectives you give it. If you don\'t describe the tools well, the agent won\'t know how to use them properly. LangChain provides a wide set of built-in tools, but also makes it easy to define your own (including custom descriptions). For a full list of built-in tools, see the [tools integrations section](/docs/integrations/tools/) ### Toolkits For many common tasks, an agent will need a set of related tools. For this LangChain provides the concept of toolkits - groups of around 3-5 tools needed to accomplish specific objectives. For example, the GitHub toolkit has a tool for searching through GitHub issues, a tool for reading a file, a tool for commenting, etc. LangChain provides a wide set of toolkits to get started. For a full list of built-in toolkits, see the [toolkits integrations section](/docs/integrations/toolkits/) ### AgentExecutor The agent executor is the runtime for an agent. This is what actually calls the agent, executes the actions it chooses, passes the action outputs back to the agent, and repeats. In pseudocode, this looks roughly like: ```python next_action = agent.get_action(...) while next_action != AgentFinish: observation = run(next_action) next_action = agent.get_action(..., next_action, observation) return next_action ``` While this may seem simple, there are several complexities this runtime handles for you, including: 1. Handling cases where the agent selects a non-existent tool 2. Handling cases where the tool errors 3. Handling cases where the agent produces output that cannot be parsed into a tool invocation 4. Logging and observability at all levels (agent decisions, tool calls) to stdout and/or to [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith). ### Other types of agent runtimes The `AgentExecutor` class is the main agent runtime supported by LangChain. However, there are other, more experimental runtimes we also support. These include: - [Plan-and-execute Agent](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/plan_and_execute) - [Baby AGI](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/baby_agi) - [Auto GPT](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/autogpt) You can also always create your own custom execution logic, which we show how to do below. ## Get started To best understand the agent framework, lets build an agent from scratch using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). We\'ll need to build the agent itself, define custom tools, and run the agent and tools in a custom loop. At the end we\'ll show how to use the standard LangChain `AgentExecutor` to make execution easier. Some important terminology (and schema) to know: 1. `AgentAction`: This is a dataclass that represents the action an agent should take. It has a `tool` property (which is the name of the tool that should be invoked) and a `tool_input` property (the input to that tool) 2. `AgentFinish`: This is a dataclass that signifies that the agent has finished and should return to the user. It has a `return_values` parameter, which is a dictionary to return. It often only has one key - `output` - that is a string, and so often it is just this key that is returned. 3. `intermediate_steps`: These represent previous agent actions and corresponding outputs that are passed around. These are important to pass to future iteration so the agent knows what work it has already done. This is typed as a `List[Tuple[AgentAction, Any]]`. Note that observation is currently left as type `Any` to be maximally flexible. In practice, this is often a string. ### Setup: LangSmith By definition, agents take a self-determined, input-dependent sequence of steps before returning a user-facing output. This makes debugging these systems particularly tricky, and observability particularly important. [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith) is especially useful for such cases. When building with LangChain, any built-in agent or custom agent built with LCEL will automatically be traced in LangSmith. And if we use the `AgentExecutor`, we\'ll get full tracing of not only the agent planning steps but also the tool inputs and outputs. To set up LangSmith we just need set the following environment variables: ```bash export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=""true"" export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="""" ``` ### Define the agent We first need to create our agent. This is the chain responsible for determining what action to take next. In this example, we will use OpenAI Function Calling to create this agent. **This is generally the most reliable way to create agents.** For this guide, we will construct a custom agent that has access to a custom tool. We are choosing this example because for most real world use cases you will NEED to customize either the agent or the tools. We\'ll create a simple tool that computes the length of a word. This is useful because it\'s actually something LLMs can mess up due to tokenization. We will first create it WITHOUT memory, but we will then show how to add memory in. Memory is needed to enable conversation. First, let\'s load the language model we\'re going to use to control the agent. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We can see that it struggles to count the letters in the string ""educa"". ```python llm.invoke(""how many letters in the word educa?"") ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'There are 6 letters in the word ""educa"".\') ``` Next, let\'s define some tools to use. Let\'s write a really simple Python function to calculate the length of a word that is passed in. ```python from langchain.agents import tool @tool def get_word_length(word: str) -> int: """"""Returns the length of a word."""""" return len(word) tools = [get_word_length] ``` Now let us create the prompt. Because OpenAI Function Calling is finetuned for tool usage, we hardly need any instructions on how to reason, or how to output format. We will just have two input variables: `input` and `agent_scratchpad`. `input` should be a string containing the user objective. `agent_scratchpad` should be a sequence of messages that contains the previous agent tool invocations and the corresponding tool outputs. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are very powerful assistant, but bad at calculating lengths of words."", ), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` How does the agent know what tools it can use? In this case we\'re relying on OpenAI function calling LLMs, which take functions as a separate argument and have been specifically trained to know when to invoke those functions. To pass in our tools to the agent, we just need to format them to the OpenAI function format and pass them to our model. (By `bind`-ing the functions, we\'re making sure that they\'re passed in each time the model is invoked.) ```python from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function llm_with_tools = llm.bind(functions=[format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools]) ``` Putting those pieces together, we can now create the agent. We will import two last utility functions: a component for formatting intermediate steps (agent action, tool output pairs) to input messages that can be sent to the model, and a component for converting the output message into an agent action/agent finish. ```python from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.agents.output_parsers import OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) ``` Now that we have our agent, let\'s play around with it! Let\'s pass in a simple question and empty intermediate steps and see what it returns: ```python agent.invoke({""input"": ""how many letters in the word educa?"", ""intermediate_steps"": []}) ``` ```text AgentActionMessageLog(tool=\'get_word_length\', tool_input={\'word\': \'educa\'}, log=""\\nInvoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}`\\n\\n\\n"", message_log=[AIMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={\'function_call\': {\'arguments\': \'{\\n ""word"": ""educa""\\n}\', \'name\': \'get_word_length\'}})]) ``` We can see that it responds with an `AgentAction` to take (it\'s actually an `AgentActionMessageLog` - a subclass of `AgentAction` which also tracks the full message log). If we\'ve set up LangSmith, we\'ll see a trace that let\'s us inspect the input and output to each step in the sequence: [ ### Define the runtime So this is just the first step - now we need to write a runtime for this. The simplest one is just one that continuously loops, calling the agent, then taking the action, and repeating until an `AgentFinish` is returned. Let\'s code that up below: ```python from langchain.schema.agent import AgentFinish user_input = ""how many letters in the word educa?"" intermediate_steps = [] while True: output = agent.invoke( { ""input"": user_input, ""intermediate_steps"": intermediate_steps, } ) if isinstance(output, AgentFinish): final_result = output.return_values[""output""] break else: print(f""TOOL NAME: {output.tool}"") print(f""TOOL INPUT: {output.tool_input}"") tool = {""get_word_length"": get_word_length}[output.tool] observation = tool.run(output.tool_input) intermediate_steps.append((output, observation)) print(final_result) ``` ```text TOOL NAME: get_word_length TOOL INPUT: {\'word\': \'educa\'} There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". ``` Woo! It\'s working. ### Using AgentExecutor To simplify this a bit, we can import and use the `AgentExecutor` class. This bundles up all of the above and adds in error handling, early stopping, tracing, and other quality-of-life improvements that reduce safeguards you need to write. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` Now let\'s test it out! ```python agent_executor.invoke({""input"": ""how many letters in the word educa?""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Invoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}` 5There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". > Finished chain. {\'input\': \'how many letters in the word educa?\', \'output\': \'There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"".\'} ``` And looking at the trace, we can see that all of our agent calls and tool invocations are automatically logged: [ ### Adding memory This is great - we have an agent! However, this agent is stateless - it doesn\'t remember anything about previous interactions. This means you can\'t ask follow up questions easily. Let\'s fix that by adding in memory. In order to do this, we need to do two things: 1. Add a place for memory variables to go in the prompt 2. Keep track of the chat history First, let\'s add a place for memory in the prompt. We do this by adding a placeholder for messages with the key `""chat_history""`. Notice that we put this ABOVE the new user input (to follow the conversation flow). ```python from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder MEMORY_KEY = ""chat_history"" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are very powerful assistant, but bad at calculating lengths of words."", ), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=MEMORY_KEY), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` We can then set up a list to track the chat history ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage chat_history = [] ``` We can then put it all together! ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), ""chat_history"": lambda x: x[""chat_history""], } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` When running, we now need to track the inputs and outputs as chat history ```python input1 = ""how many letters in the word educa?"" result = agent_executor.invoke({""input"": input1, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend( [ HumanMessage(content=input1), AIMessage(content=result[""output""]), ] ) agent_executor.invoke({""input"": ""is that a real word?"", ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Invoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}` 5There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". > Finished chain. > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

In an API call, you can describe functions and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. The goal of the OpenAI Function APIs is to more reliably return valid and useful function calls than a generic text completion or chat API. The OpenAI Functions Agent is designed to work with these models. Install `openai`, `google-search-results` packages which are required as the LangChain packages call them internally. ```bash pip install openai google-search-results ``` ## Initialize tools We will first create some tools we can use ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent from langchain.chains import LLMMathChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper, SQLDatabase from langchain_experimental.sql import SQLDatabaseChain ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"") search = SerpAPIWrapper() llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain.from_llm(llm=llm, verbose=True) db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(""sqlite:///../../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db"") db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True) tools = [ Tool( name=""Search"", func=search.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events.

62,What are some ways of doing retrieval augmented generation?,"['Remembrall | Remembrall This page covers how to use the [Remembrall]( ecosystem within LangChain. ## What is Remembrall? Remembrall gives your language model long-term memory, retrieval augmented generation, and complete observability with just a few lines of code. ![Remembrall Dashboard](/assets/images/RemembrallDashboard-36b4f535ae0718f2f5923084caf111de.png) It works as a light-weight proxy on top of your OpenAI calls and simply augments the context of the chat calls at runtime with relevant facts that have been collected. ## Setup To get started, [sign in with Github on the Remembrall platform]( and copy your [API key from the settings page]( Any request that you send with the modified `openai_api_base` (see below) and Remembrall API key will automatically be tracked in the Remembrall dashboard. You **never** have to share your OpenAI key with our platform and this information is **never** stored by the Remembrall systems. ### Enable Long Term Memory In addition to setting the `openai_api_base` and Remembrall API key via `x-gp-api-key`, you should specify a UID to maintain memory for. This will usually be a unique user identifier (like email). ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI chat_model = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_base="" model_kwargs={ ""headers"":{ ""x-gp-api-key"": ""remembrall-api-key-here"", ""x-gp-remember"": ""user@email.com"", } }) chat_model.predict(""My favorite color is blue."") import time; time.sleep(5) # wait for system to save fact via auto save print(chat_model.predict(""What is my favorite color?"")) ``` ### Enable Retrieval Augmented Generation First, create a document context in the [Remembrall dashboard]( Paste in the document texts or upload documents as PDFs to be processed. Save the Document Context ID and insert it as shown below. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI chat_model = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_base="" model_kwargs={ ""headers"":{ ""x-gp-api-key"": ""remembrall-api-key-here"", ""x-gp-context"": ""document-context-id-goes-here"", } }) print(chat_model.predict(""This is a question that can be answered with my document."")) ``` - [What is Remembrall?](#what-is-remembrall) - [Setup](#setup)- [Enable Long Term Memory](#enable-long-term-memory) - [Enable Retrieval Augmented Generation](#enable-retrieval-augmented-generation)', 'Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) | Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) []( ## Overview ### What is RAG? RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer: ``` We\'ll use the [LCEL Runnable]( protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box ```python from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python for chunk in rag_chain.stream(""What is Task Decomposition?""): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Task decomposition can be performed by AI models with prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ### Go deeper #### Choosing LLMs `ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model wrapper.

We can build a ""condense question"" chain that looks something like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder condense_q_system_prompt = """"""Given a chat history and the latest user question \\ which might reference the chat history, formulate a standalone question \\ which can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \\ just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."""""" condense_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", condense_q_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) condense_q_chain = condense_q_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""What is meant by large"", } ) ``` ```text \'What is the definition of ""large"" in the context of a language model?\' ``` ```python condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""How do transformers work"", } ) ``` ```text \'How do transformer models function?\' ``` And now we can build our full QA chain. Notice we add some routing functionality to only run the ""condense question chain"" when our chat history isn\'t empty. ```python qa_system_prompt = """"""You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \\ Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. \\ If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. \\ Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\ {context}"""""" qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", qa_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) def condense_question(input: dict): if input.get(""chat_history""): return condense_q_chain else: return input[""question""] rag_chain = ( RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=condense_question | retriever | format_docs) | qa_prompt | llm ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] question = ""What is Task Decomposition?"" ai_msg = rag_chain.invoke({""question"": question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=question), ai_msg]) second_question = ""What are common ways of doing it?"" rag_chain.invoke({""question"": second_question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'Common ways of task decomposition include:\\n\\n1. Using Chain of Thought (CoT): CoT is a prompting technique that instructs the model to ""think step by step"" and decompose complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It utilizes more test-time computation and sheds light on the model\\\'s thinking process.\\n\\n2. Prompting with LLM: Language Model (LLM) can be used to prompt the model with simple instructions like ""Steps for XYZ"" or ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"" This allows the model to generate a sequence of subtasks or thought steps.\\n\\n3. Task-specific instructions: For certain tasks, task-specific instructions can be provided to guide the model in decomposing the task. For example, for writing a novel, the instruction ""Write a story outline"" can be given to break down the task into manageable steps.\\n\\n4. Human inputs: In some cases, human inputs can be used to assist in task decomposition. Humans can provide their expertise and knowledge to identify and break down complex tasks into smaller subtasks.\') ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( Here we\'ve gone over how to add chain logic for incorporating historical outputs. But how do we actually store and retrieve historical outputs for different sessions? For that check out the LCEL [How to add message history (memory)](/docs/expression_language/how_to/message_history) page. ## Next steps That\'s a lot of content we\'ve covered in a short amount of time. There\'s plenty of nuances, features, integrations, etc to explore in each of the above sections. Aside from the sources mentioned above, good next steps include: - Reading up on more advanced retrieval techniques in the [Retrievers](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/) section. - Learning about the LangChain [Indexing API](/docs/modules/data_connection/indexing), which helps repeatedly sync data sources and vector stores without redundant computation or storage. - Exploring RAG [LangChain Templates](/docs/templates/#-advanced-retrieval), which are reference applications that can easily be deployed with [LangServe](/docs/langserve). - Learning about [evaluating RAG applications with LangSmith]( - [Overview](#overview)- [What is RAG?](#what-is-rag) - [What\'s in this guide?](#whats-in-this-guide) - [Architecture](#architecture) - [Setup](#setup)- [Dependencies](#dependencies) - [LangSmith](#langsmith) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Detailed walkthrough](#detailed-walkthrough) - [Step 1.

They\'ve started by embedding the top 1200 Python libraries to enable code generation with up-to-date knowledge. They\'ve been kind enough to share their embeddings of the [LangChain docs]( and [API reference]( Let\'s take a look at how we can use these embeddings to power a docs retrieval system and ultimately a simple code generating chain! ```bash pip install langchain fleet-context openai pandas faiss-cpu # faiss-gpu for CUDA supported GPU ``` ```python from operator import itemgetter from typing import Any, Optional, Type import pandas as pd from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.retrievers import MultiVectorRetriever from langchain.schema import Document from langchain.schema.storage import BaseStore from langchain.schema.vectorstore import VectorStore from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS def load_fleet_retriever( df: pd.DataFrame, *, vectorstore_cls: Type[VectorStore] = FAISS, docstore: Optional[BaseStore] = None, **kwargs: Any, ): vectorstore = _populate_vectorstore(df, vectorstore_cls) if docstore is None: return vectorstore.as_retriever(**kwargs) else: _populate_docstore(df, docstore) return MultiVectorRetriever( vectorstore=vectorstore, docstore=docstore, id_key=""parent"", **kwargs ) def _populate_vectorstore( df: pd.DataFrame, vectorstore_cls: Type[VectorStore], ) -> VectorStore: if not hasattr(vectorstore_cls, ""from_embeddings""): raise ValueError( f""Incompatible vector store class {vectorstore_cls}.""

This means the vectors correspond to sections of pages in the LangChain docs, not entire pages. By default, when we spin up a retriever from these embeddings, we\'ll be retrieving these embedded chunks. We will be using Fleet Context\'s `download_embeddings()` to grab Langchain\'s documentation embeddings. You can view all supported libraries\' documentation at [ ```python from context import download_embeddings df = download_embeddings(""langchain"") vecstore_retriever = load_fleet_retriever(df) ``` ```python vecstore_retriever.get_relevant_documents(""How does the multi vector retriever work"") ``` ```text [Document(page_content=""# Vector store-backed retriever A vector store retriever is a retriever that uses a vector store to retrieve documents.

By generating multiple perspectives on the same question, the `MultiQueryRetriever` might be able to overcome some of the limitations of the distance-based retrieval and get a richer set of results.By generating multiple perspectives on the same question, the `MultiQueryRetriever` might be able to overcome some of the limitations of the distance-based retrieval and get a richer set of results. ``` # Build a sample vectorDBfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chromafrom langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoaderfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter# Load blog postloader = WebBaseLoader("" = loader.load()# Splittext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0)splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data)# VectorDBembedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=embedding) ``` #### Simple usage[\\u200b](#simple-usage) Specify the LLM to use for query generation, and the retriever will do the rest.``` from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetrieverquestion = ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?

1. **Simple RAG**: Use a retriever to fetch relevant documents based on a user query, then pass these documents to a language model to generate an answer.

2. **RAG with Memory**: Incorporate user history into the retrieval process to provide more context-aware responses.

3. **RAG with Multiple Retrievers**: Combine outputs from different retrievers to enhance the relevance of retrieved documents.

4. **RAG with Summarization**: Summarize retrieved documents before passing them to the language model to reduce context length and focus on key information.

5. **RAG with Hypothetical Questions**: Generate hypothetical questions related to the document to improve retrieval and context for the language model.

6. **RAG with Maximum Marginal Relevance**: Use MMR to retrieve documents that are both relevant and diverse, avoiding redundancy.

Choose the method based on your specific use case and requirements.","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a process that involves retrieving external data and using it in the generation step of language models. LangChain provides various building blocks for RAG applications. Here are some ways of doing retrieval augmented generation:

- Document loaders: LangChain offers over 100 document loaders to load documents from different sources, including private S3 buckets and public websites.
- Document transformers: These help in fetching relevant parts of documents by splitting or chunking large documents into smaller chunks.
- Text embedding models: LangChain integrates with over 25 different embedding providers and methods to create embeddings for documents, allowing efficient similarity-based retrieval.
- Vector stores: With the rise of embeddings, LangChain supports over 50 vector stores for efficient storage and searching of embeddings.
- Retrievers: LangChain supports various retrieval algorithms, including semantic search, parent document retriever, self-query retriever, ensemble retriever, and more, to retrieve the data from the database.

These components work together to enable retrieval augmented generation in LangChain. [0] [1]",0.9999999999666667,1.0,,0.15807437922444717,0.17647058823529413

64,What is a chain?,"['Router | Router Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. As a very simple example, let\'s suppose we have two templates optimized for different types of questions, and we want to choose the template based on the user input. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate physics_template = """"""You are a very smart physics professor. \\ You are great at answering questions about physics in a concise and easy to understand manner. \\ When you don\'t know the answer to a question you admit that you don\'t know.

Here is a question: {input}"""""" math_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(math_template) ``` ## Using LCEL We can easily do this using a `RunnableBranch`. A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch ``` ```python general_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a helpful assistant.

The spectral characteristics of the radiation are determined by the temperature of the body, which implies that a black body at a given temperature will emit the same amount of radiation at every frequency. ``` ```python print( chain.run( ""What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?"" ) ) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( math: {\'input\': \'What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?\'} > Finished chain.

This can be seen by breaking down the problem: 1) We know that a prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and one. 2) We also know that if a number is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. So, if we want to find the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3, we can start counting up from 40, testing each number to see if it is prime and if the sum of the number and one is divisible by three. The first number we come to that satisfies these conditions is 43. ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?\'} > Finished chain.

Let\'s dive in. ## Setup ### Installation To install LangChain run: Pip ```bash pip install langchain ``` Conda ```bash conda install langchain -c conda-forge ``` For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/get_started/installation). ### Environment Using LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, APIs, etc. For this example, we\'ll use OpenAI\'s model APIs. First we\'ll need to install their Python package: ```bash pip install openai ``` Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading [here]( Once we have a key we\'ll want to set it as an environment variable by running: ```bash export OPENAI_API_KEY=""..."" ``` If you\'d prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the `openai_api_key` named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=""..."") ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```shell export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=""true"" export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=... ``` ### LangServe LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain chains as a REST API. You do not need to use LangServe to use LangChain, but in this guide we\'ll show how you can deploy your app with LangServe. Install with: ```bash pip install ""langserve[all]"" ``` ## Building with LangChain LangChain provides many modules that can be used to build language model applications. Modules can be used as standalones in simple applications and they can be composed for more complex use cases. Composition is powered by **LangChain Expression Language** (LCEL), which defines a unified `Runnable` interface that many modules implement, making it possible to seamlessly chain components. The simplest and most common chain contains three things: - LLM/Chat Model: The language model is the core reasoning engine here. In order to work with LangChain, you need to understand the different types of language models and how to work with them. - Prompt Template: This provides instructions to the language model. This controls what the language model outputs, so understanding how to construct prompts and different prompting strategies is crucial. - Output Parser: These translate the raw response from the language model to a more workable format, making it easy to use the output downstream. In this guide we\'ll cover those three components individually, and then go over how to combine them. Understanding these concepts will set you up well for being able to use and customize LangChain applications. Most LangChain applications allow you to configure the model and/or the prompt, so knowing how to take advantage of this will be a big enabler. ### LLM / Chat Model There are two types of language models: - `LLM`: underlying model takes a string as input and returns a string - `ChatModel`: underlying model takes a list of messages as input and returns a message Strings are simple, but what exactly are messages? The base message interface is defined by `BaseMessage`, which has two required attributes: - `content`: The content of the message. Usually a string. - `role`: The entity from which the `BaseMessage` is coming. LangChain provides several objects to easily distinguish between different roles: - `HumanMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from a human/user. - `AIMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from an AI/assistant. - `SystemMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from the system. - `FunctionMessage` / `ToolMessage`: A `BaseMessage` containing the output of a function or tool call. If none of those roles sound right, there is also a `ChatMessage` class where you can specify the role manually. LangChain provides a common interface that\'s shared by both `LLM`s and `ChatModel`s. However it\'s useful to understand the difference in order to most effectively construct prompts for a given language model. The simplest way to call an `LLM` or `ChatModel` is using `.invoke()`, the universal synchronous call method for all LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) objects: - `LLM.invoke`: Takes in a string, returns a string. - `ChatModel.invoke`: Takes in a list of `BaseMessage`, returns a `BaseMessage`. The input types for these methods are actually more general than this, but for simplicity here we can assume LLMs only take strings and Chat models only takes lists of messages. Check out the ""Go deeper"" section below to learn more about model invocation. Let\'s see how to work with these different types of models and these different types of inputs. First, let\'s import an LLM and a ChatModel. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = OpenAI() chat_model = ChatOpenAI() ``` `LLM` and `ChatModel` objects are effectively configuration objects. You can initialize them with parameters like `temperature` and others, and pass them around. ```python from langchain.schema import HumanMessage text = ""What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"" messages = [HumanMessage(content=text)] llm.invoke(text) # >> Feetful of Fun chat_model.invoke(messages) # >> AIMessage(content=""Socks O\'Color"") ``` Go deeper `LLM.invoke` and `ChatModel.invoke` actually both support as input any of `Union[str, List[BaseMessage], PromptValue]`. `PromptValue` is an object that defines it\'s own custom logic for returning it\'s inputs either as a string or as messages. `LLM`s have logic for coercing any of these into a string, and `ChatModel`s have logic for coercing any of these to messages. The fact that `LLM` and `ChatModel` accept the same inputs means that you can directly swap them for one another in most chains without breaking anything, though it\'s of course important to think about how inputs are being coerced and how that may affect model performance. To dive deeper on models head to the [Language models](/docs/modules/model_io/models) section. ### Prompt templates Most LLM applications do not pass user input directly into an LLM. Usually they will add the user input to a larger piece of text, called a prompt template, that provides additional context on the specific task at hand. In the previous example, the text we passed to the model contained instructions to generate a company name. For our application, it would be great if the user only had to provide the description of a company/product, without having to worry about giving the model instructions. PromptTemplates help with exactly this! They bundle up all the logic for going from user input into a fully formatted prompt. This can start off very simple - for example, a prompt to produce the above string would just be: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"") prompt.format(product=""colorful socks"") ``` ```python What is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks? ``` However, the advantages of using these over raw string formatting are several. You can ""partial"" out variables - e.g. you can format only some of the variables at a time. You can compose them together, easily combining different templates into a single prompt. For explanations of these functionalities, see the [section on prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts) for more detail. `PromptTemplate`s can also be used to produce a list of messages. In this case, the prompt not only contains information about the content, but also each message (its role, its position in the list, etc.). Here, what happens most often is a `ChatPromptTemplate` is a list of `ChatMessageTemplates`. Each `ChatMessageTemplate` contains instructions for how to format that `ChatMessage` - its role, and then also its content. Let\'s take a look at this below: ```python from langchain.prompts.chat import ChatPromptTemplate template = ""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}."" human_template = ""{text}"" chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", template), (""human"", human_template), ]) chat_prompt.format_messages(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."") ``` ```pycon [ SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."", additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming."") ] ``` ChatPromptTemplates can also be constructed in other ways - see the [section on prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts) for more detail. ### Output parsers `OutputParsers` convert the raw output of a language model into a format that can be used downstream. There are few main types of `OutputParser`s, including: - Convert text from `LLM` into structured information (e.g. JSON) - Convert a `ChatMessage` into just a string - Convert the extra information returned from a call besides the message (like OpenAI function invocation) into a string. For full information on this, see the [section on output parsers](/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers). In this getting started guide, we will write our own output parser - one that converts a comma separated list into a list. ```python from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""""" def parse(self, text: str): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call."""""" return text.strip().split("", "") CommaSeparatedListOutputParser().parse(""hi, bye"") # >> [\'hi\', \'bye\'] ``` ### Composing with LCEL We can now combine all these into one chain. This chain will take input variables, pass those to a prompt template to create a prompt, pass the prompt to a language model, and then pass the output through an (optional) output parser. This is a convenient way to bundle up a modular piece of logic. Let\'s see it in action! ```python from typing import List from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser[List[str]]): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""""" def parse(self, text: str) -> List[str]: """"""Parse the output of an LLM call."""""" return text.strip().split("", "") template = """"""You are a helpful assistant who generates comma separated lists. A user will pass in a category, and you should generate 5 objects in that category in a comma separated list. ONLY return a comma separated list, and nothing more."""""" human_template = ""{text}"" chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", template), (""human"", human_template), ]) chain = chat_prompt | ChatOpenAI() | CommaSeparatedListOutputParser() chain.invoke({""text"": ""colors""}) # >> [\'red\', \'blue\', \'green\', \'yellow\', \'orange\'] ``` Note that we are using the `|` syntax to join these components together. This `|` syntax is powered by the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and relies on the universal `Runnable` interface that all of these objects implement. To learn more about LCEL, read the documentation [here](/docs/expression_language). ## Tracing with LangSmith Assuming we\'ve set our environment variables as shown in the beginning, all of the model and chain calls we\'ve been making will have been automatically logged to LangSmith. Once there, we can use LangSmith to debug and annotate our application traces, then turn them into datasets for evaluating future iterations of the application. Check out what the trace for the above chain would look like: [ For more on LangSmith [head here](/docs/langsmith/). ## Serving with LangServe Now that we\'ve built an application, we need to serve it. That\'s where LangServe comes in. LangServe helps developers deploy LCEL chains as a REST API. The library is integrated with FastAPI and uses pydantic for data validation. ### Server To create a server for our application we\'ll make a `serve.py` file with three things: 1. The definition of our chain (same as above) 2. Our FastAPI app 3. A definition of a route from which to serve the chain, which is done with `langserve.add_routes` ```python #!/usr/bin/env python from typing import List from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser from langserve import add_routes # 1. Chain definition class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser[List[str]]): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""""" def parse(self, text: str) -> List[str]: """"""Parse the output of an LLM call."""""" return text.strip().split("", "") template = """"""You are a helpful assistant who generates comma separated lists. A user will pass in a category, and you should generate 5 objects in that category in a comma separated list. ONLY return a comma separated list, and nothing more."""""" human_template = ""{text}"" chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", template), (""human"", human_template), ]) category_chain = chat_prompt | ChatOpenAI() | CommaSeparatedListOutputParser() # 2. App definition app = FastAPI( title=""LangChain Server"", version=""1.0"", description=""A simple api server using Langchain\'s Runnable interfaces"", ) # 3. Adding chain route add_routes( app, category_chain, path=""/category_chain"", ) if __name__ == ""__main__"": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, host=""localhost"", port=8000) ``` And that\'s it! If we execute this file: ```bash python serve.py ``` we should see our chain being served at localhost:8000. ### Playground Every LangServe service comes with a simple built-in UI for configuring and invoking the application with streaming output and visibility into intermediate steps. Head to to try it out! ### Client Now let\'s set up a client for programmatically interacting with our service. We can easily do this with the `langserve.RemoteRunnable`. Using this, we can interact with the served chain as if it were running client-side. ```python from langserve import RemoteRunnable remote_chain = RemoteRunnable("" remote_chain.invoke({""text"": ""colors""}) # >> [\'red\', \'blue\', \'green\', \'yellow\', \'orange\'] ``` To learn more about the many other features of LangServe [head here](/docs/langserve). ## Next steps We\'ve touched on how to build an application with LangChain, how to trace it with LangSmith, and how to serve it with LangServe.

LCEL was designed from day 1 to **support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes**, from the simplest prompt + LLM chain to the most complex chains (we've seen folks successfully run LCEL chains with 100s of steps in production). To highlight a few of the reasons you might want to use LCEL: **Streaming support** When you build your chains with LCEL you get the best possible time-to-first-token (time elapsed until the first chunk of output comes out). For some chains this means eg. we stream tokens straight from an LLM to a streaming output parser, and you get back parsed, incremental chunks of output at the same rate as the LLM provider outputs the raw tokens. **Async support** Any chain built with LCEL can be called both with the synchronous API (eg. in your Jupyter notebook while prototyping) as well as with the asynchronous API (eg. in a [LangServe](/docs/langsmith) server). This enables using the same code for prototypes and in production, with great performance, and the ability to handle many concurrent requests in the same server. **Optimized parallel execution** Whenever your LCEL chains have steps that can be executed in parallel (eg if you fetch documents from multiple retrievers) we automatically do it, both in the sync and the async interfaces, for the smallest possible latency. **Retries and fallbacks** Configure retries and fallbacks for any part of your LCEL chain. This is a great way to make your chains more reliable at scale. We're currently working on adding streaming support for retries/fallbacks, so you can get the added reliability without any latency cost. **Access intermediate results** For more complex chains it's often very useful to access the results of intermediate steps even before the final output is produced. This can be used let end-users know something is happening, or even just to debug your chain. You can stream intermediate results, and it's available on every [LangServe](/docs/langserve) server. **Input and output schemas** Input and output schemas give every LCEL chain Pydantic and JSONSchema schemas inferred from the structure of your chain. This can be used for validation of inputs and outputs, and is an integral part of LangServe. **Seamless LangSmith tracing integration** As your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what exactly is happening at every step. With LCEL, **all** steps are automatically logged to [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith/) for maximum observability and debuggability. **Seamless LangServe deployment integration** Any chain created with LCEL can be easily deployed using [LangServe](/docs/langserve).""]","LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is a declarative way to compose chains together in LangChain.

Most developers from a web services background are probably familiar with Redis. At it\'s core, Redis is an open-source key-value store that can be used as a cache, message broker, and database. Developers choose Redis because it is fast, has a large ecosystem of client libraries, and has been deployed by major enterprises for years. On top of these traditional use cases, Redis provides additional capabilities like the Search and Query capability that allows users to create secondary index structures within Redis. This allows Redis to be a Vector Database, at the speed of a cache. ## Redis as a Vector Database Redis uses compressed, inverted indexes for fast indexing with a low memory footprint. It also supports a number of advanced features such as: - Indexing of multiple fields in Redis hashes and JSON - Vector similarity search (with HNSW (ANN) or FLAT (KNN)) - Vector Range Search (e.g. find all vectors within a radius of a query vector) - Incremental indexing without performance loss - Document ranking (using [tf-idf]( with optional user-provided weights) - Field weighting - Complex boolean queries with AND, OR, and NOT operators - Prefix matching, fuzzy matching, and exact-phrase queries - Support for [double-metaphone phonetic matching]( - Auto-complete suggestions (with fuzzy prefix suggestions) - Stemming-based query expansion in [many languages]( (using [Snowball]( - Support for Chinese-language tokenization and querying (using [Friso]( - Numeric filters and ranges - Geospatial searches using [Redis geospatial indexing](/commands/georadius) - A powerful aggregations engine - Supports for all utf-8 encoded text - Retrieve full documents, selected fields, or only the document IDs - Sorting results (for example, by creation date) ## Clients Since redis is much more than just a vector database, there are often use cases that demand usage of a Redis client besides just the langchain integration. You can use any standard Redis client library to run Search and Query commands, but it\'s easiest to use a library that wraps the Search and Query API. Below are a few examples, but you can find more client libraries [here]( | Project | Language | License | Author | Stars | | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | | jedis | Java | MIT | Redis | | | redisvl | Python | MIT | Redis | | | redis-py | Python | MIT | Redis | | | node-redis | Node.js | MIT | Redis | | | nredisstack | .NET | MIT | Redis | | ## Deployment Options There are many ways to deploy Redis with RediSearch. The easiest way to get started is to use Docker, but there are are many potential options for deployment such as - [Redis Cloud]( - [Docker (Redis Stack)]( - Cloud marketplaces: [AWS Marketplace]( [Google Marketplace]( or [Azure Marketplace]( - On-premise: [Redis Enterprise Software]( - Kubernetes: [Redis Enterprise Software on Kubernetes]( ## Examples Many examples can be found in the [Redis AI team\'s GitHub]( - [Awesome Redis AI Resources]( - List of examples of using Redis in AI workloads - [Azure OpenAI Embeddings Q&A]( - OpenAI and Redis as a Q&A service on Azure. - [ArXiv Paper Search]( - Semantic search over arXiv scholarly papers - [Vector Search on Azure]( - Vector search on Azure using Azure Cache for Redis and Azure OpenAI ## More Resources For more information on how to use Redis as a vector database, check out the following resources: - [RedisVL Documentation]( - Documentation for the Redis Vector Library Client - [Redis Vector Similarity Docs]( - Redis official docs for Vector Search. - [Redis-py Search Docs]( - Documentation for redis-py client library - [Vector Similarity Search: From Basics to Production]( - Introductory blog post to VSS and Redis as a VectorDB. ## Install Redis Python Client Redis-py is the officially supported client by Redis. Recently released is the RedisVL client which is purpose-built for the Vector Database use cases. Both can be installed with pip. ```bash pip install redis redisvl openai tiktoken ``` We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ## Sample Data First we will describe some sample data so that the various attributes of the Redis vector store can be demonstrated. ```python metadata = [ { ""user"": ""john"", ""age"": 18, ""job"": ""engineer"", ""credit_score"": ""high"", }, { ""user"": ""derrick"", ""age"": 45, ""job"": ""doctor"", ""credit_score"": ""low"", }, { ""user"": ""nancy"", ""age"": 94, ""job"": ""doctor"", ""credit_score"": ""high"", }, { ""user"": ""tyler"", ""age"": 100, ""job"": ""engineer"", ""credit_score"": ""high"", }, { ""user"": ""joe"", ""age"": 35, ""job"": ""dentist"", ""credit_score"": ""medium"", }, ] texts = [""foo"", ""foo"", ""foo"", ""bar"", ""bar""] ``` ## Initializing Redis To locally deploy Redis, run: ```console docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest ``` If things are running correctly you should see a nice Redis UI at See the [Deployment Options](#deployment-options) section above for other ways to deploy. The Redis VectorStore instance can be initialized in a number of ways. There are multiple class methods that can be used to initialize a Redis VectorStore instance. - `Redis.__init__` - Initialize directly - `Redis.from_documents` - Initialize from a list of `Langchain.docstore.Document` objects - `Redis.from_texts` - Initialize from a list of texts (optionally with metadata) - `Redis.from_texts_return_keys` - Initialize from a list of texts (optionally with metadata) and return the keys - `Redis.from_existing_index` - Initialize from an existing Redis index Below we will use the `Redis.from_texts` method. ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import Redis rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, embeddings, metadatas=metadata, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", index_name=""users"", ) ``` ```python rds.index_name ``` ```text \'users\' ``` ## Inspecting the Created Index Once the `Redis` VectorStore object has been constructed, an index will have been created in Redis if it did not already exist. The index can be inspected with both the `rvl`and the `redis-cli` command line tool. If you installed `redisvl` above, you can use the `rvl` command line tool to inspect the index. ```bash # assumes you\'re running Redis locally (use --host, --port, --password, --username, to change this) rvl index listall ``` ```text 16:58:26 [RedisVL] INFO Indices: 16:58:26 [RedisVL] INFO 1. users ``` The `Redis` VectorStore implementation will attempt to generate index schema (fields for filtering) for any metadata passed through the `from_texts`, `from_texts_return_keys`, and `from_documents` methods. This way, whatever metadata is passed will be indexed into the Redis search index allowing for filtering on those fields. Below we show what fields were created from the metadata we defined above ```bash rvl index info -i users ``` ```text Index Information: Index Name Storage Type Prefixes Index Options Indexing users HASH [\'doc:users\'] [] 0 Index Fields: Name Attribute Type Field Option Option Value user user TEXT WEIGHT 1 job job TEXT WEIGHT 1 credit_score credit_score TEXT WEIGHT 1 content content TEXT WEIGHT 1 age age NUMERIC content_vector content_vector VECTOR ``` ```bash rvl stats -i users ``` ```text Statistics: Stat Key Value num_docs 5 num_terms 15 max_doc_id 5 num_records 33 percent_indexed 1 hash_indexing_failures 0 number_of_uses 4 bytes_per_record_avg 4.60606 doc_table_size_mb 0.000524521 inverted_sz_mb 0.000144958 key_table_size_mb 0.000193596 offset_bits_per_record_avg 8 offset_vectors_sz_mb 2.19345e-05 offsets_per_term_avg 0.69697 records_per_doc_avg 6.6 sortable_values_size_mb 0 total_indexing_time 0.32 total_inverted_index_blocks 16 vector_index_sz_mb 6.0126 ``` It\'s important to note that we have not specified that the `user`, `job`, `credit_score` and `age` in the metadata should be fields within the index, this is because the `Redis` VectorStore object automatically generate the index schema from the passed metadata. For more information on the generation of index fields, see the API documentation. ## Querying\u200b There are multiple ways to query the `Redis` VectorStore implementation based on what use case you have: - `similarity_search`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector. - `similarity_search_with_score`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector and return the vector distance - `similarity_search_limit_score`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector and limit the number of results to the `score_threshold` - `similarity_search_with_relevance_scores`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector and return the vector similarities - `max_marginal_relevance_search`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector while also optimizing for diversity ```python results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"") print(results[0].page_content) ``` ```text foo ``` ```python # return metadata results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3) meta = results[1].metadata print(""Key of the document in Redis: "", meta.pop(""id"")) print(""Metadata of the document: "", meta) ``` ```text Key of the document in Redis: doc:users:a70ca43b3a4e4168bae57c78753a200f Metadata of the document: {\'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'} ``` ```python # with scores (distances) results = rds.similarity_search_with_score(""foo"", k=5) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Score: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: bar --- Score: 0.1566 Content: bar --- Score: 0.1566 ``` ```python # limit the vector distance that can be returned results = rds.similarity_search_with_score(""foo"", k=5, distance_threshold=0.1) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Score: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 ``` ```python # with scores results = rds.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(""foo"", k=5) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Similiarity: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Similiarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similiarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similiarity: 1.0 Content: bar --- Similiarity: 0.8434 Content: bar --- Similiarity: 0.8434 ``` ```python # limit scores (similarities have to be over .9) results = rds.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(""foo"", k=5, score_threshold=0.9) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Similarity: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Similarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similarity: 1.0 ``` ```python # you can also add new documents as follows new_document = [""baz""] new_metadata = [{""user"": ""sam"", ""age"": 50, ""job"": ""janitor"", ""credit_score"": ""high""}] # both the document and metadata must be lists rds.add_texts(new_document, new_metadata) ``` ```text [\'doc:users:b9c71d62a0a34241a37950b448dafd38\'] ``` ```python # now query the new document results = rds.similarity_search(""baz"", k=3) print(results[0].metadata) ``` ```text {\'id\': \'doc:users:b9c71d62a0a34241a37950b448dafd38\', \'user\': \'sam\', \'job\': \'janitor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'50\'} ``` ```python # use maximal marginal relevance search to diversify results results = rds.max_marginal_relevance_search(""foo"") ``` ```python # the lambda_mult parameter controls the diversity of the results, the lower the more diverse results = rds.max_marginal_relevance_search(""foo"", lambda_mult=0.1) ``` ## Connect to an Existing Index\u200b In order to have the same metadata indexed when using the `Redis` VectorStore. You will need to have the same `index_schema` passed in either as a path to a yaml file or as a dictionary. The following shows how to obtain the schema from an index and connect to an existing index. ```python # write the schema to a yaml file rds.write_schema(""redis_schema.yaml"") ``` The schema file for this example should look something like: ```yaml numeric: - name: age no_index: false sortable: false text: - name: user no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false - name: job no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false - name: credit_score no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false - name: content no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false vector: - algorithm: FLAT block_size: 1000 datatype: FLOAT32 dims: 1536 distance_metric: COSINE initial_cap: 20000 name: content_vector ``` **Notice**, this include **all** possible fields for the schema. You can remove any fields that you don\'t need. ```python # now we can connect to our existing index as follows new_rds = Redis.from_existing_index( embeddings, index_name=""users"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", schema=""redis_schema.yaml"", ) results = new_rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3) print(results[0].metadata) ``` ```text {\'id\': \'doc:users:8484c48a032d4c4cbe3cc2ed6845fabb\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'} ``` ```python # see the schemas are the same new_rds.schema == rds.schema ``` ```text True ``` ## Custom Metadata Indexing\u200b In some cases, you may want to control what fields the metadata maps to. For example, you may want the `credit_score` field to be a categorical field instead of a text field (which is the default behavior for all string fields). In this case, you can use the `index_schema` parameter in each of the initialization methods above to specify the schema for the index. Custom index schema can either be passed as a dictionary or as a path to a yaml file. All arguments in the schema have defaults besides the name, so you can specify only the fields you want to change. All the names correspond to the snake/lowercase versions of the arguments you would use on the command line with `redis-cli` or in `redis-py`. For more on the arguments for each field, see the [documentation]( The below example shows how to specify the schema for the `credit_score` field as a Tag (categorical) field instead of a text field. ```yaml # index_schema.yml tag: - name: credit_score text: - name: user - name: job numeric: - name: age ``` In Python this would look like: ```python index_schema = { ""tag"": [{""name"": ""credit_score""}], ""text"": [{""name"": ""user""}, {""name"": ""job""}], ""numeric"": [{""name"": ""age""}], } ``` Notice that only the `name` field needs to be specified. All other fields have defaults. ```python # create a new index with the new schema defined above index_schema = { ""tag"": [{""name"": ""credit_score""}], ""text"": [{""name"": ""user""}, {""name"": ""job""}], ""numeric"": [{""name"": ""age""}], } rds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys( texts, embeddings, metadatas=metadata, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", index_name=""users_modified"", index_schema=index_schema, # pass in the new index schema ) ``` ```text `index_schema` does not match generated metadata schema. If you meant to manually override the schema, please ignore this message. index_schema: {\'tag\': [{\'name\': \'credit_score\'}], \'text\': [{\'name\': \'user\'}, {\'name\': \'job\'}], \'numeric\': [{\'name\': \'age\'}]} generated_schema: {\'text\': [{\'name\': \'user\'}, {\'name\': \'job\'}, {\'name\': \'credit_score\'}], \'numeric\': [{\'name\': \'age\'}], \'tag\': []} ``` The above warning is meant to notify users when they are overriding the default behavior. Ignore it if you are intentionally overriding the behavior. ## Hybrid Filtering\u200b With the Redis Filter Expression language built into langchain, you can create arbitrarily long chains of hybrid filters that can be used to filter your search results. The expression language is derived from the [RedisVL Expression Syntax]( and is designed to be easy to use and understand. The following are the available filter types: - `RedisText`: Filter by full-text search against metadata fields. Supports exact, fuzzy, and wildcard matching. - `RedisNum`: Filter by numeric range against metadata fields. - `RedisTag`: Filter by exact match against string based categorical metadata fields. Multiple tags can be specified like ""tag1,tag2,tag3"". The following are examples of utilizing these filters. ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisText, RedisNum, RedisTag # exact matching has_high_credit = RedisTag(""credit_score"") == ""high"" does_not_have_high_credit = RedisTag(""credit_score"") != ""low"" # fuzzy matching job_starts_with_eng = RedisText(""job"") % ""eng*"" job_is_engineer = RedisText(""job"") == ""engineer"" job_is_not_engineer = RedisText(""job"") != ""engineer"" # numeric filtering age_is_18 = RedisNum(""age"") == 18 age_is_not_18 = RedisNum(""age"") != 18 age_is_greater_than_18 = RedisNum(""age"") > 18 age_is_less_than_18 = RedisNum(""age"") < 18 age_is_greater_than_or_equal_to_18 = RedisNum(""age"") >= 18 age_is_less_than_or_equal_to_18 = RedisNum(""age"") <= 18 ``` The `RedisFilter` class can be used to simplify the import of these filters as follows ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisFilter # same examples as above has_high_credit = RedisFilter.tag(""credit_score"") == ""high"" does_not_have_high_credit = RedisFilter.num(""age"") > 8 job_starts_with_eng = RedisFilter.text(""job"") % ""eng*"" ``` The following are examples of using hybrid filter for search ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisText is_engineer = RedisText(""job"") == ""engineer"" results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3, filter=is_engineer) print(""Job:"", results[0].metadata[""job""]) print(""Engineers in the dataset:"", len(results)) ``` ```text Job: engineer Engineers in the dataset: 2 ``` ```python # fuzzy match starts_with_doc = RedisText(""job"") % ""doc*"" results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3, filter=starts_with_doc) for result in results: print(""Job:"", result.metadata[""job""]) print(""Jobs in dataset that start with \'doc\':"", len(results)) ``` ```text Job: doctor Job: doctor Jobs in dataset that start with \'doc\': 2 ``` ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisNum is_over_18 = RedisNum(""age"") > 18 is_under_99 = RedisNum(""age"") < 99 age_range = is_over_18 & is_under_99 results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", filter=age_range) for result in results: print(""User:"", result.metadata[""user""], ""is"", result.metadata[""age""]) ``` ```text User: derrick is 45 User: nancy is 94 User: joe is 35 ``` ```python # make sure to use parenthesis around FilterExpressions # if initializing them while constructing them age_range = (RedisNum(""age"") > 18) & (RedisNum(""age"") < 99) results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", filter=age_range) for result in results: print(""User:"", result.metadata[""user""], ""is"", result.metadata[""age""]) ``` ```text User: derrick is 45 User: nancy is 94 User: joe is 35 ``` ## Redis as Retriever\u200b Here we go over different options for using the vector store as a retriever. There are three different search methods we can use to do retrieval. By default, it will use semantic similarity. ```python query = ""foo"" results = rds.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=3, return_metadata=True) for result in results: print(""Content:"", result[0].page_content, "" --- Score: "", result[1]) ``` ```text Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 ``` ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 4}) ``` ```python docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) docs ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:988ecca7574048e396756efc0e79aeca\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:009b1afeb4084cc6bdef858c7a99b48e\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:7087cee9be5b4eca93c30fbdd09a2731\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'}), Document(page_content=\'bar\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:01ef6caac12b42c28ad870aefe574253\', \'user\': \'tyler\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'100\'})] ``` There is also the `similarity_distance_threshold` retriever which allows the user to specify the vector distance ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever( search_type=""similarity_distance_threshold"", search_kwargs={""k"": 4, ""distance_threshold"": 0.1}, ) ``` ```python docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) docs ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:988ecca7574048e396756efc0e79aeca\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:009b1afeb4084cc6bdef858c7a99b48e\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:7087cee9be5b4eca93c30fbdd09a2731\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'})] ``` Lastly, the `similarity_score_threshold` allows the user to define the minimum score for similar documents ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever( search_type=""similarity_score_threshold"", search_kwargs={""score_threshold"": 0.9, ""k"": 10}, ) ``` ```python retriever.get_relevant_documents(""foo"") ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:988ecca7574048e396756efc0e79aeca\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:009b1afeb4084cc6bdef858c7a99b48e\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:7087cee9be5b4eca93c30fbdd09a2731\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'})] ``` ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever( search_type=""mmr"", search_kwargs={""fetch_k"": 20, ""k"": 4, ""lambda_mult"": 0.1} ) ``` ```python retriever.get_relevant_documents(""foo"") ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:8f6b673b390647809d510112cde01a27\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'bar\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:93521560735d42328b48c9c6f6418d6a\', \'user\': \'tyler\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'100\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:125ecd39d07845eabf1a699d44134a5b\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:d6200ab3764c466082fde3eaab972a2a\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'})] ``` # Delete keys To delete your entries you have to address them by their keys. ```python Redis.delete(keys, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"") ``` ```text True ``` ```python # delete the indices too Redis.drop_index( index_name=""users"", delete_documents=True, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"" ) Redis.drop_index( index_name=""users_modified"", delete_documents=True, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) ``` ```text True ``` ### Redis connection Url examples\u200b Valid Redis Url scheme are: 1. `redis://` - Connection to Redis standalone, unencrypted 2. `rediss://` - Connection to Redis standalone, with TLS encryption 3. `redis+sentinel://` - Connection to Redis server via Redis Sentinel, unencrypted 4. `rediss+sentinel://` - Connection to Redis server via Redis Sentinel, booth connections with TLS encryption More information about additional connection parameter can be found in the redis-py documentation at [ ```python # connection to redis standalone at localhost, db 0, no password redis_url = ""redis://localhost:6379"" # connection to host ""redis"" port 7379 with db 2 and password ""secret"" (old style authentication scheme without username / pre 6.x) redis_url = ""redis://:secret@redis:7379/2"" # connection to host redis on default port with user ""joe"", pass ""secret"" using redis version 6+ ACLs redis_url = ""redis://joe:secret@redis/0"" # connection to sentinel at localhost with default group mymaster and db 0, no password redis_url = ""redis+sentinel://localhost:26379"" # connection to sentinel at host redis with default port 26379 and user ""joe"" with password ""secret"" with default group mymaster and db 0 redis_url = ""redis+sentinel://joe:secret@redis"" # connection to sentinel, no auth with sentinel monitoring group ""zone-1"" and database 2 redis_url = ""redis+sentinel://redis:26379/zone-1/2"" # connection to redis standalone at localhost, db 0, no password but with TLS support redis_url = ""rediss://localhost:6379"" # connection to redis sentinel at localhost and default port, db 0, no password # but with TLS support for booth Sentinel and Redis server redis_url = ""rediss+sentinel://localhost"" ``` -

LLMs are a great tool for this given their proficiency in understanding and synthesizing text. In this walkthrough we\'ll go over how to perform document summarization using LLMs. ![Image description](/assets/images/summarization_use_case_1-cdb1b94b53af261bd997a9934a8c3703.png) ## Overview A central question for building a summarizer is how to pass your documents into the LLM\'s context window. Two common approaches for this are: 1. `Stuff`: Simply ""stuff"" all your documents into a single prompt. This is the simplest approach (see [here](/docs/modules/chains/document/stuff) for more on the `StuffDocumentsChains`, which is used for this method). 2. `Map-reduce`: Summarize each document on it\'s own in a ""map"" step and then ""reduce"" the summaries into a final summary (see [here](/docs/modules/chains/document/map_reduce) for more on the `MapReduceDocumentsChain`, which is used for this method). ![Image description](/assets/images/summarization_use_case_2-f2a4d5d60980a79140085fb7f8043217.png) ## Quickstart To give you a sneak preview, either pipeline can be wrapped in a single object: `load_summarize_chain`. Suppose we want to summarize a blog post. We can create this in a few lines of code.

Stuff\u200b When we use `load_summarize_chain` with `chain_type=""stuff""`, we will use the [StuffDocumentsChain](/docs/modules/chains/document/stuff). The chain will take a list of documents, inserts them all into a prompt, and passes that prompt to an LLM: ```python from langchain.chains.combine_documents.stuff import StuffDocumentsChain from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate # Define prompt prompt_template = """"""Write a concise summary of the following: ""{text}"" CONCISE SUMMARY:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template) # Define LLM chain llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"") llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) # Define StuffDocumentsChain stuff_chain = StuffDocumentsChain(llm_chain=llm_chain, document_variable_name=""text"") docs = loader.load() print(stuff_chain.run(docs)) ``` ```text The article discusses the concept of building autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs).

We can see that we reproduce the earlier result using the `load_summarize_chain`. ### Go deeper\u200b - You can easily customize the prompt. - You can easily try different LLMs, (e.g., [Claude](/docs/integrations/chat/anthropic)) via the `llm` parameter. ## Option 2. Map-Reduce\u200b Let\'s unpack the map reduce approach. For this, we\'ll first map each document to an individual summary using an `LLMChain`. Then we\'ll use a `ReduceDocumentsChain` to combine those summaries into a single global summary. First, we specify the LLMChain to use for mapping each document to an individual summary: ```python from langchain.chains import MapReduceDocumentsChain, ReduceDocumentsChain from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) # Map map_template = """"""The following is a set of documents {docs} Based on this list of docs, please identify the main themes Helpful Answer:"""""" map_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(map_template) map_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=map_prompt) ``` We can also use the Prompt Hub to store and fetch prompts. This will work with your [LangSmith API key]( For example, see the map prompt [here]( ```python from langchain import hub map_prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/map-prompt"") map_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=map_prompt) ``` The `ReduceDocumentsChain` handles taking the document mapping results and reducing them into a single output. It wraps a generic `CombineDocumentsChain` (like `StuffDocumentsChain`) but adds the ability to collapse documents before passing it to the `CombineDocumentsChain` if their cumulative size exceeds `token_max`. In this example, we can actually re-use our chain for combining our docs to also collapse our docs. So if the cumulative number of tokens in our mapped documents exceeds 4000 tokens, then we\'ll recursively pass in the documents in batches of < 4000 tokens to our `StuffDocumentsChain` to create batched summaries. And once those batched summaries are cumulatively less than 4000 tokens, we\'ll pass them all one last time to the `StuffDocumentsChain` to create the final summary. ```python # Reduce reduce_template = """"""The following is set of summaries: {doc_summaries} Take these and distill it into a final, consolidated summary of the main themes. Helpful Answer:"""""" reduce_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(reduce_template) ``` ```python # Note we can also get this from the prompt hub, as noted above reduce_prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/map-prompt"") ``` ```python reduce_prompt ``` ```text ChatPromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'docs\'], messages=[HumanMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'docs\'], template=\'The following is a set of documents:\\n{docs}\\nBased on this list of docs, please identify the main themes \\nHelpful Answer:\'))]) ``` ```python # Run chain reduce_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=reduce_prompt) # Takes a list of documents, combines them into a single string, and passes this to an LLMChain combine_documents_chain = StuffDocumentsChain( llm_chain=reduce_chain, document_variable_name=""docs"" ) # Combines and iteravely reduces the mapped documents reduce_documents_chain = ReduceDocumentsChain( # This is final chain that is called. combine_documents_chain=combine_documents_chain, # If documents exceed context for `StuffDocumentsChain` collapse_documents_chain=combine_documents_chain, # The maximum number of tokens to group documents into. token_max=4000, ) ``` Combining our map and reduce chains into one: ```python # Combining documents by mapping a chain over them, then combining results map_reduce_chain = MapReduceDocumentsChain( # Map chain llm_chain=map_chain, # Reduce chain reduce_documents_chain=reduce_documents_chain, # The variable name in the llm_chain to put the documents in document_variable_name=""docs"", # Return the results of the map steps in the output return_intermediate_steps=False, ) text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0 ) split_docs = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```text Created a chunk of size 1003, which is longer than the specified 1000 ``` ```python print(map_reduce_chain.run(split_docs)) ``` ```text Based on the list of documents provided, the main themes can be identified as follows: 1. LLM-powered autonomous agents: The documents discuss the concept of building agents with LLM as their core controller and highlight the potential of LLM beyond generating written content. They explore the capabilities of LLM as a general problem solver. 2. Agent system overview: The documents provide an overview of the components that make up a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, including planning, memory, and tool use. Each component is explained in detail, highlighting its role in enhancing the agent\'s capabilities. 3. Planning: The documents discuss how the agent breaks down large tasks into smaller subgoals and utilizes self-reflection to improve the quality of its actions and results. 4. Memory: The documents explain the importance of both short-term and long-term memory in an agent system. Short-term memory is utilized for in-context learning, while long-term memory allows the agent to retain and recall information over extended periods. 5. Tool use: The documents highlight the agent\'s ability to call external APIs for additional information and resources that may be missing from its pre-trained model weights. This includes accessing current information, executing code, and retrieving proprietary information. 6. Case studies and proof-of-concept examples: The documents provide examples of how LLM-powered autonomous agents can be applied in various domains, such as scientific discovery and generative agent simulations. These case studies serve as examples of the capabilities and potential applications of such agents. 7. Challenges: The documents acknowledge the challenges associated with building and utilizing LLM-powered autonomous agents, although specific challenges are not mentioned in the given set of documents. 8. Citation and references: The documents include a citation and reference section, indicating that the information presented is based on existing research and sources. Overall, the main themes in the provided documents revolve around LLM-powered autonomous agents, their components and capabilities, planning, memory, tool use, case studies, and challenges. ``` ### Go deeper\u200b **Customization** - As shown above, you can customize the LLMs and prompts for map and reduce stages. **Real-world use-case** - See [this blog post]( case-study on analyzing user interactions (questions about LangChain documentation)! - The blog post and associated [repo]( also introduce clustering as a means of summarization. - This opens up a third path beyond the `stuff` or `map-reduce` approaches that is worth considering. ![Image description](/assets/images/summarization_use_case_3-4247e4011d0a52901288005bfaf20dc1.png) ## Option 3. Refine\u200b [Refine](/docs/modules/chains/document/refine) is similar to map-reduce: The refine documents chain constructs a response by looping over the input documents and iteratively updating its answer. For each document, it passes all non-document inputs, the current document, and the latest intermediate answer to an LLM chain to get a new answer. This can be easily run with the `chain_type=""refine""` specified. ```python chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""refine"") chain.run(split_docs) ``` ```text \'The article explores the concept of building autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) and their potential as problem solvers.

Esplora i diversi componenti di un sistema di agenti alimentato da LLM, tra cui la pianificazione, la memoria e l\'uso degli strumenti. Dimostrazioni di concetto come AutoGPT mostrano il potenziale di LLM come risolutore generale di problemi. Approcci come Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, LLM+P, ReAct e Reflexion consentono agli agenti autonomi di pianificare, riflettere su se stessi e migliorarsi iterativamente. Tuttavia, ci sono sfide da affrontare, come la limitata capacità di contesto che limita l\'inclusione di informazioni storiche dettagliate e la difficoltà di pianificazione a lungo termine e decomposizione delle attività. Inoltre, l\'affidabilità dell\'interfaccia di linguaggio naturale tra LLM e componenti esterni come la memoria e gli strumenti è incerta, poiché i LLM possono commettere errori di formattazione e mostrare comportamenti ribelli. Nonostante ciò, il sistema AutoGPT viene menzionato come esempio di dimostrazione di concetto che utilizza LLM come controller principale per agenti autonomi.

To use, you should have the redis python package installed and have a running Redis Enterprise or Redis-Stack server For production use cases, it is recommended to use Redis Enterprise as the scaling, performance, stability and availability is much better than Redis-Stack. For testing and prototyping, however, this is not required. Redis-Stack is available as a docker container the full vector search API available. # to run redis stack in docker locally docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest Once running, you can connect to the redis server with the following url schemas: - redis://: # simple connection - redis://:@: # connection with authentication - rediss://: # connection with SSL - rediss://:@: # connection with SSL and auth Examples: The following examples show various ways to use the Redis VectorStore with LangChain. For all the following examples assume we have the following imports: from langchain.vectorstores import Redis from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings Initialize, create index, and load Documentsfrom langchain.vectorstores import Redis from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings rds = Redis.from_documents( documents, # a list of Document objects from loaders or created embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize, create index, and load Documents with metadatards = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize, create index, and load Documents with metadata and return keys rds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) For use cases where the index needs to stay alive, you can initialize with an index name such that it\'s easier to reference later rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_name=""my-index"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize and connect to an existing index (from above) rds = Redis.from_existing_index( embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_name=""my-index"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Advanced examples: Custom vector schema can be supplied to change the way that Redis creates the underlying vector schema. This is useful for production use cases where you want to optimize the vector schema for your use case. ex. using HNSW instead of FLAT (knn) which is the default vector_schema = { ""algorithm"": ""HNSW"" } rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object vector_schema=vector_schema, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Custom index schema can be supplied to change the way that the metadata is indexed. This is useful for you would like to use the hybrid querying (filtering) capability of Redis. By default, this implementation will automatically generate the index schema according to the following rules: All strings are indexed as text fields All numbers are indexed as numeric fields All lists of strings are indexed as tag fields (joined bylangchain.vectorstores.redis.constants.REDIS_TAG_SEPARATOR) All None values are not indexed but still stored in Redis these arenot retrievable through the interface here, but the raw Redis client can be used to retrieve them. All other types are not indexed To override these rules, you can pass in a custom index schema like the following tag: - name: credit_score text: - name: user - name: job Typically, the credit_score field would be a text field since it\'s a string, however, we can override this behavior by specifying the field type as shown with the yaml config (can also be a dictionary) above and the code below. rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_schema=""path/to/index_schema.yaml"", # can also be a dictionary redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) When connecting to an existing index where a custom schema has been applied, it\'s important to pass in the same schema to the from_existing_index method. Otherwise, the schema for newly added samples will be incorrect and metadata will not be returned. Initialize with necessary components.

Last updated on Nov 17, 2023. Show this page source', 'Redis | Redis [Redis (Remote Dictionary Server)]( is an open-source in-memory storage, used as a distributed, in-memory keyvalue database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Because it holds all data in memory and because of its design, `Redis` offers low-latency reads and writes, making it particularly suitable for use cases that require a cache. Redis is the most popular NoSQL database, and one of the most popular databases overall. This page covers how to use the [Redis]( ecosystem within LangChain. It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Redis wrappers. ## Installation and Setup Install the Python SDK: ```bash pip install redis ``` ## Wrappers All wrappers need a redis url connection string to connect to the database support either a stand alone Redis server or a High-Availability setup with Replication and Redis Sentinels. ### Redis Standalone connection url For standalone `Redis` server, the official redis connection url formats can be used as describe in the python redis modules ""from_url()"" method [Redis.from_url]( Example: `redis_url = ""redis://:secret-pass@localhost:6379/0""` ### Redis Sentinel connection url For [Redis sentinel setups]( the connection scheme is ""redis+sentinel"". This is an unofficial extensions to the official IANA registered protocol schemes as long as there is no connection url for Sentinels available. Example: `redis_url = ""redis+sentinel://:secret-pass@sentinel-host:26379/mymaster/0""` The format is `redis+sentinel://[[username]:[password]]@[host-or-ip]:[port]/[service-name]/[db-number]` with the default values of ""service-name = mymaster"" and ""db-number = 0"" if not set explicit. The service-name is the redis server monitoring group name as configured within the Sentinel. The current url format limits the connection string to one sentinel host only (no list can be given) and booth Redis server and sentinel must have the same password set (if used). ### Redis Cluster connection url Redis cluster is not supported right now for all methods requiring a ""redis_url"" parameter. The only way to use a Redis Cluster is with LangChain classes accepting a preconfigured Redis client like `RedisCache` (example below). ### Cache The Cache wrapper allows for [Redis]( to be used as a remote, low-latency, in-memory cache for LLM prompts and responses. #### Standard Cache The standard cache is the Redis bread & butter of use case in production for both [open-source]( and [enterprise]( users globally. To import this cache: ```python from langchain.cache import RedisCache ``` To use this cache with your LLMs: ```python from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache import redis redis_client = redis.Redis.from_url(...) set_llm_cache(RedisCache(redis_client)) ``` #### Semantic Cache Semantic caching allows users to retrieve cached prompts based on semantic similarity between the user input and previously cached results. Under the hood it blends Redis as both a cache and a vectorstore. To import this cache: ```python from langchain.cache import RedisSemanticCache ``` To use this cache with your LLMs: ```python from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache import redis # use any embedding provider... from tests.integration_tests.vectorstores.fake_embeddings import FakeEmbeddings redis_url = ""redis://localhost:6379"" set_llm_cache(RedisSemanticCache( embedding=FakeEmbeddings(), redis_url=redis_url )) ``` ### VectorStore The vectorstore wrapper turns Redis into a low-latency [vector database]( for semantic search or LLM content retrieval. To import this vectorstore: ```python from langchain.vectorstores import Redis ``` For a more detailed walkthrough of the Redis vectorstore wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis). ### Retriever The Redis vector store retriever wrapper generalizes the vectorstore class to perform low-latency document retrieval. To create the retriever, simply call `.as_retriever()` on the base vectorstore class. ### Memory Redis can be used to persist LLM conversations. #### Vector Store Retriever Memory For a more detailed walkthrough of the `VectorStoreRetrieverMemory` wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/modules/memory/types/vectorstore_retriever_memory). #### Chat Message History Memory For a detailed example of Redis to cache conversation message history, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/memory/redis_chat_message_history). - [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) - [Wrappers](#wrappers)- [Redis Standalone connection url](#redis-standalone-connection-url) - [Redis Sentinel connection url](#redis-sentinel-connection-url) - [Redis Cluster connection url](#redis-cluster-connection-url) - [Cache](#cache) - [VectorStore](#vectorstore) - [Retriever](#retriever) - [Memory](#memory)', 'Redis | Redis Redis vector database introduction and langchain integration guide. ## What is Redis? Most developers from a web services background are probably familiar with Redis. At it\'s core, Redis is an open-source key-value store that can be used as a cache, message broker, and database. Developers choose Redis because it is fast, has a large ecosystem of client libraries, and has been deployed by major enterprises for years. On top of these traditional use cases, Redis provides additional capabilities like the Search and Query capability that allows users to create secondary index structures within Redis. This allows Redis to be a Vector Database, at the speed of a cache. ## Redis as a Vector Database Redis uses compressed, inverted indexes for fast indexing with a low memory footprint. It also supports a number of advanced features such as: - Indexing of multiple fields in Redis hashes and JSON - Vector similarity search (with HNSW (ANN) or FLAT (KNN)) - Vector Range Search (e.g. find all vectors within a radius of a query vector) - Incremental indexing without performance loss - Document ranking (using [tf-idf]( with optional user-provided weights) - Field weighting - Complex boolean queries with AND, OR, and NOT operators - Prefix matching, fuzzy matching, and exact-phrase queries - Support for [double-metaphone phonetic matching]( - Auto-complete suggestions (with fuzzy prefix suggestions) - Stemming-based query expansion in [many languages]( (using [Snowball]( - Support for Chinese-language tokenization and querying (using [Friso]( - Numeric filters and ranges - Geospatial searches using [Redis geospatial indexing](/commands/georadius) - A powerful aggregations engine - Supports for all utf-8 encoded text - Retrieve full documents, selected fields, or only the document IDs - Sorting results (for example, by creation date) ## Clients Since redis is much more than just a vector database, there are often use cases that demand usage of a Redis client besides just the langchain integration. You can use any standard Redis client library to run Search and Query commands, but it\'s easiest to use a library that wraps the Search and Query API. Below are a few examples, but you can find more client libraries [here]( | Project | Language | License | Author | Stars | | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | | jedis | Java | MIT | Redis | | | redisvl | Python | MIT | Redis | | | redis-py | Python | MIT | Redis | | | node-redis | Node.js | MIT | Redis | | | nredisstack | .NET | MIT | Redis | | ## Deployment Options There are many ways to deploy Redis with RediSearch. The easiest way to get started is to use Docker, but there are are many potential options for deployment such as - [Redis Cloud]( - [Docker (Redis Stack)]( - Cloud marketplaces: [AWS Marketplace]( [Google Marketplace]( or [Azure Marketplace]( - On-premise: [Redis Enterprise Software]( - Kubernetes: [Redis Enterprise Software on Kubernetes]( ## Examples Many examples can be found in the [Redis AI team\'s GitHub]( - [Awesome Redis AI Resources]( - List of examples of using Redis in AI workloads - [Azure OpenAI Embeddings Q&A]( - OpenAI and Redis as a Q&A service on Azure. - [ArXiv Paper Search]( - Semantic search over arXiv scholarly papers - [Vector Search on Azure]( - Vector search on Azure using Azure Cache for Redis and Azure OpenAI ## More Resources For more information on how to use Redis as a vector database, check out the following resources: - [RedisVL Documentation]( - Documentation for the Redis Vector Library Client - [Redis Vector Similarity Docs]( - Redis official docs for Vector Search. - [Redis-py Search Docs]( - Documentation for redis-py client library - [Vector Similarity Search: From Basics to Production]( - Introductory blog post to VSS and Redis as a VectorDB. ## Install Redis Python Client Redis-py is the officially supported client by Redis. Recently released is the RedisVL client which is purpose-built for the Vector Database use cases. Both can be installed with pip. ```bash pip install redis redisvl openai tiktoken ``` We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ## Sample Data First we will describe some sample data so that the various attributes of the Redis vector store can be demonstrated. ```python metadata = [ { ""user"": ""john"", ""age"": 18, ""job"": ""engineer"", ""credit_score"": ""high"", }, { ""user"": ""derrick"", ""age"": 45, ""job"": ""doctor"", ""credit_score"": ""low"", }, { ""user"": ""nancy"", ""age"": 94, ""job"": ""doctor"", ""credit_score"": ""high"", }, { ""user"": ""tyler"", ""age"": 100, ""job"": ""engineer"", ""credit_score"": ""high"", }, { ""user"": ""joe"", ""age"": 35, ""job"": ""dentist"", ""credit_score"": ""medium"", }, ] texts = [""foo"", ""foo"", ""foo"", ""bar"", ""bar""] ``` ## Initializing Redis To locally deploy Redis, run: ```console docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest ``` If things are running correctly you should see a nice Redis UI at See the [Deployment Options](#deployment-options) section above for other ways to deploy. The Redis VectorStore instance can be initialized in a number of ways. There are multiple class methods that can be used to initialize a Redis VectorStore instance. - `Redis.__init__` - Initialize directly - `Redis.from_documents` - Initialize from a list of `Langchain.docstore.Document` objects - `Redis.from_texts` - Initialize from a list of texts (optionally with metadata) - `Redis.from_texts_return_keys` - Initialize from a list of texts (optionally with metadata) and return the keys - `Redis.from_existing_index` - Initialize from an existing Redis index Below we will use the `Redis.from_texts` method. ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import Redis rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, embeddings, metadatas=metadata, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", index_name=""users"", ) ``` ```python rds.index_name ``` ```text \'users\' ``` ## Inspecting the Created Index Once the `Redis` VectorStore object has been constructed, an index will have been created in Redis if it did not already exist. The index can be inspected with both the `rvl`and the `redis-cli` command line tool. If you installed `redisvl` above, you can use the `rvl` command line tool to inspect the index. ```bash # assumes you\'re running Redis locally (use --host, --port, --password, --username, to change this) rvl index listall ``` ```text 16:58:26 [RedisVL] INFO Indices: 16:58:26 [RedisVL] INFO 1. users ``` The `Redis` VectorStore implementation will attempt to generate index schema (fields for filtering) for any metadata passed through the `from_texts`, `from_texts_return_keys`, and `from_documents` methods. This way, whatever metadata is passed will be indexed into the Redis search index allowing for filtering on those fields. Below we show what fields were created from the metadata we defined above ```bash rvl index info -i users ``` ```text Index Information: Index Name Storage Type Prefixes Index Options Indexing users HASH [\'doc:users\'] [] 0 Index Fields: Name Attribute Type Field Option Option Value user user TEXT WEIGHT 1 job job TEXT WEIGHT 1 credit_score credit_score TEXT WEIGHT 1 content content TEXT WEIGHT 1 age age NUMERIC content_vector content_vector VECTOR ``` ```bash rvl stats -i users ``` ```text Statistics: Stat Key Value num_docs 5 num_terms 15 max_doc_id 5 num_records 33 percent_indexed 1 hash_indexing_failures 0 number_of_uses 4 bytes_per_record_avg 4.60606 doc_table_size_mb 0.000524521 inverted_sz_mb 0.000144958 key_table_size_mb 0.000193596 offset_bits_per_record_avg 8 offset_vectors_sz_mb 2.19345e-05 offsets_per_term_avg 0.69697 records_per_doc_avg 6.6 sortable_values_size_mb 0 total_indexing_time 0.32 total_inverted_index_blocks 16 vector_index_sz_mb 6.0126 ``` It\'s important to note that we have not specified that the `user`, `job`, `credit_score` and `age` in the metadata should be fields within the index, this is because the `Redis` VectorStore object automatically generate the index schema from the passed metadata. For more information on the generation of index fields, see the API documentation. ## Querying\u200b There are multiple ways to query the `Redis` VectorStore implementation based on what use case you have: - `similarity_search`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector. - `similarity_search_with_score`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector and return the vector distance - `similarity_search_limit_score`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector and limit the number of results to the `score_threshold` - `similarity_search_with_relevance_scores`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector and return the vector similarities - `max_marginal_relevance_search`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector while also optimizing for diversity ```python results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"") print(results[0].page_content) ``` ```text foo ``` ```python # return metadata results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3) meta = results[1].metadata print(""Key of the document in Redis: "", meta.pop(""id"")) print(""Metadata of the document: "", meta) ``` ```text Key of the document in Redis: doc:users:a70ca43b3a4e4168bae57c78753a200f Metadata of the document: {\'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'} ``` ```python # with scores (distances) results = rds.similarity_search_with_score(""foo"", k=5) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Score: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: bar --- Score: 0.1566 Content: bar --- Score: 0.1566 ``` ```python # limit the vector distance that can be returned results = rds.similarity_search_with_score(""foo"", k=5, distance_threshold=0.1) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Score: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 ``` ```python # with scores results = rds.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(""foo"", k=5) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Similiarity: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Similiarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similiarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similiarity: 1.0 Content: bar --- Similiarity: 0.8434 Content: bar --- Similiarity: 0.8434 ``` ```python # limit scores (similarities have to be over .9) results = rds.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(""foo"", k=5, score_threshold=0.9) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Similarity: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Similarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similarity: 1.0 ``` ```python # you can also add new documents as follows new_document = [""baz""] new_metadata = [{""user"": ""sam"", ""age"": 50, ""job"": ""janitor"", ""credit_score"": ""high""}] # both the document and metadata must be lists rds.add_texts(new_document, new_metadata) ``` ```text [\'doc:users:b9c71d62a0a34241a37950b448dafd38\'] ``` ```python # now query the new document results = rds.similarity_search(""baz"", k=3) print(results[0].metadata) ``` ```text {\'id\': \'doc:users:b9c71d62a0a34241a37950b448dafd38\', \'user\': \'sam\', \'job\': \'janitor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'50\'} ``` ```python # use maximal marginal relevance search to diversify results results = rds.max_marginal_relevance_search(""foo"") ``` ```python # the lambda_mult parameter controls the diversity of the results, the lower the more diverse results = rds.max_marginal_relevance_search(""foo"", lambda_mult=0.1) ``` ## Connect to an Existing Index\u200b In order to have the same metadata indexed when using the `Redis` VectorStore. You will need to have the same `index_schema` passed in either as a path to a yaml file or as a dictionary. The following shows how to obtain the schema from an index and connect to an existing index. ```python # write the schema to a yaml file rds.write_schema(""redis_schema.yaml"") ``` The schema file for this example should look something like: ```yaml numeric: - name: age no_index: false sortable: false text: - name: user no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false - name: job no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false - name: credit_score no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false - name: content no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false vector: - algorithm: FLAT block_size: 1000 datatype: FLOAT32 dims: 1536 distance_metric: COSINE initial_cap: 20000 name: content_vector ``` **Notice**, this include **all** possible fields for the schema. You can remove any fields that you don\'t need. ```python # now we can connect to our existing index as follows new_rds = Redis.from_existing_index( embeddings, index_name=""users"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", schema=""redis_schema.yaml"", ) results = new_rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3) print(results[0].metadata) ``` ```text {\'id\': \'doc:users:8484c48a032d4c4cbe3cc2ed6845fabb\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'} ``` ```python # see the schemas are the same new_rds.schema == rds.schema ``` ```text True ``` ## Custom Metadata Indexing\u200b In some cases, you may want to control what fields the metadata maps to. For example, you may want the `credit_score` field to be a categorical field instead of a text field (which is the default behavior for all string fields). In this case, you can use the `index_schema` parameter in each of the initialization methods above to specify the schema for the index. Custom index schema can either be passed as a dictionary or as a path to a yaml file. All arguments in the schema have defaults besides the name, so you can specify only the fields you want to change. All the names correspond to the snake/lowercase versions of the arguments you would use on the command line with `redis-cli` or in `redis-py`. For more on the arguments for each field, see the [documentation]( The below example shows how to specify the schema for the `credit_score` field as a Tag (categorical) field instead of a text field. ```yaml # index_schema.yml tag: - name: credit_score text: - name: user - name: job numeric: - name: age ``` In Python this would look like: ```python index_schema = { ""tag"": [{""name"": ""credit_score""}], ""text"": [{""name"": ""user""}, {""name"": ""job""}], ""numeric"": [{""name"": ""age""}], } ``` Notice that only the `name` field needs to be specified. All other fields have defaults. ```python # create a new index with the new schema defined above index_schema = { ""tag"": [{""name"": ""credit_score""}], ""text"": [{""name"": ""user""}, {""name"": ""job""}], ""numeric"": [{""name"": ""age""}], } rds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys( texts, embeddings, metadatas=metadata, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", index_name=""users_modified"", index_schema=index_schema, # pass in the new index schema ) ``` ```text `index_schema` does not match generated metadata schema. If you meant to manually override the schema, please ignore this message. index_schema: {\'tag\': [{\'name\': \'credit_score\'}], \'text\': [{\'name\': \'user\'}, {\'name\': \'job\'}], \'numeric\': [{\'name\': \'age\'}]} generated_schema: {\'text\': [{\'name\': \'user\'}, {\'name\': \'job\'}, {\'name\': \'credit_score\'}], \'numeric\': [{\'name\': \'age\'}], \'tag\': []} ``` The above warning is meant to notify users when they are overriding the default behavior. Ignore it if you are intentionally overriding the behavior. ## Hybrid Filtering\u200b With the Redis Filter Expression language built into langchain, you can create arbitrarily long chains of hybrid filters that can be used to filter your search results. The expression language is derived from the [RedisVL Expression Syntax]( and is designed to be easy to use and understand. The following are the available filter types: - `RedisText`: Filter by full-text search against metadata fields. Supports exact, fuzzy, and wildcard matching. - `RedisNum`: Filter by numeric range against metadata fields. - `RedisTag`: Filter by exact match against string based categorical metadata fields. Multiple tags can be specified like ""tag1,tag2,tag3"". The following are examples of utilizing these filters. ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisText, RedisNum, RedisTag # exact matching has_high_credit = RedisTag(""credit_score"") == ""high"" does_not_have_high_credit = RedisTag(""credit_score"") != ""low"" # fuzzy matching job_starts_with_eng = RedisText(""job"") % ""eng*"" job_is_engineer = RedisText(""job"") == ""engineer"" job_is_not_engineer = RedisText(""job"") != ""engineer"" # numeric filtering age_is_18 = RedisNum(""age"") == 18 age_is_not_18 = RedisNum(""age"") != 18 age_is_greater_than_18 = RedisNum(""age"") > 18 age_is_less_than_18 = RedisNum(""age"") < 18 age_is_greater_than_or_equal_to_18 = RedisNum(""age"") >= 18 age_is_less_than_or_equal_to_18 = RedisNum(""age"") <= 18 ``` The `RedisFilter` class can be used to simplify the import of these filters as follows ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisFilter # same examples as above has_high_credit = RedisFilter.tag(""credit_score"") == ""high"" does_not_have_high_credit = RedisFilter.num(""age"") > 8 job_starts_with_eng = RedisFilter.text(""job"") % ""eng*"" ``` The following are examples of using hybrid filter for search ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisText is_engineer = RedisText(""job"") == ""engineer"" results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3, filter=is_engineer) print(""Job:"", results[0].metadata[""job""]) print(""Engineers in the dataset:"", len(results)) ``` ```text Job: engineer Engineers in the dataset: 2 ``` ```python # fuzzy match starts_with_doc = RedisText(""job"") % ""doc*"" results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3, filter=starts_with_doc) for result in results: print(""Job:"", result.metadata[""job""]) print(""Jobs in dataset that start with \'doc\':"", len(results)) ``` ```text Job: doctor Job: doctor Jobs in dataset that start with \'doc\': 2 ``` ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisNum is_over_18 = RedisNum(""age"") > 18 is_under_99 = RedisNum(""age"") < 99 age_range = is_over_18 & is_under_99 results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", filter=age_range) for result in results: print(""User:"", result.metadata[""user""], ""is"", result.metadata[""age""]) ``` ```text User: derrick is 45 User: nancy is 94 User: joe is 35 ``` ```python # make sure to use parenthesis around FilterExpressions # if initializing them while constructing them age_range = (RedisNum(""age"") > 18) & (RedisNum(""age"") < 99) results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", filter=age_range) for result in results: print(""User:"", result.metadata[""user""], ""is"", result.metadata[""age""]) ``` ```text User: derrick is 45 User: nancy is 94 User: joe is 35 ``` ## Redis as Retriever\u200b Here we go over different options for using the vector store as a retriever. There are three different search methods we can use to do retrieval. By default, it will use semantic similarity. ```python query = ""foo"" results = rds.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=3, return_metadata=True) for result in results: print(""Content:"", result[0].page_content, "" --- Score: "", result[1]) ``` ```text Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 ``` ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 4}) ``` ```python docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) docs ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:988ecca7574048e396756efc0e79aeca\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:009b1afeb4084cc6bdef858c7a99b48e\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:7087cee9be5b4eca93c30fbdd09a2731\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'}), Document(page_content=\'bar\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:01ef6caac12b42c28ad870aefe574253\', \'user\': \'tyler\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'100\'})] ``` There is also the `similarity_distance_threshold` retriever which allows the user to specify the vector distance ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever( search_type=""similarity_distance_threshold"", search_kwargs={""k"": 4, ""distance_threshold"": 0.1}, ) ``` ```python docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) docs ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:988ecca7574048e396756efc0e79aeca\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:009b1afeb4084cc6bdef858c7a99b48e\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:7087cee9be5b4eca93c30fbdd09a2731\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'})] ``` Lastly, the `similarity_score_threshold` allows the user to define the minimum score for similar documents ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever( search_type=""similarity_score_threshold"", search_kwargs={""score_threshold"": 0.9, ""k"": 10}, ) ``` ```python retriever.get_relevant_documents(""foo"") ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:988ecca7574048e396756efc0e79aeca\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:009b1afeb4084cc6bdef858c7a99b48e\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:7087cee9be5b4eca93c30fbdd09a2731\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'})] ``` ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever( search_type=""mmr"", search_kwargs={""fetch_k"": 20, ""k"": 4, ""lambda_mult"": 0.1} ) ``` ```python retriever.get_relevant_documents(""foo"") ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:8f6b673b390647809d510112cde01a27\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'bar\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:93521560735d42328b48c9c6f6418d6a\', \'user\': \'tyler\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'100\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:125ecd39d07845eabf1a699d44134a5b\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:d6200ab3764c466082fde3eaab972a2a\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'})] ``` # Delete keys To delete your entries you have to address them by their keys. ```python Redis.delete(keys, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"") ``` ```text True ``` ```python # delete the indices too Redis.drop_index( index_name=""users"", delete_documents=True, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"" ) Redis.drop_index( index_name=""users_modified"", delete_documents=True, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) ``` ```text True ``` ### Redis connection Url examples\u200b Valid Redis Url scheme are: 1. `redis://` - Connection to Redis standalone, unencrypted 2. `rediss://` - Connection to Redis standalone, with TLS encryption 3. `redis+sentinel://` - Connection to Redis server via Redis Sentinel, unencrypted 4. `rediss+sentinel://` - Connection to Redis server via Redis Sentinel, booth connections with TLS encryption More information about additional connection parameter can be found in the redis-py documentation at [ ```python # connection to redis standalone at localhost, db 0, no password redis_url = ""redis://localhost:6379"" # connection to host ""redis"" port 7379 with db 2 and password ""secret"" (old style authentication scheme without username / pre 6.x) redis_url = ""redis://:secret@redis:7379/2"" # connection to host redis on default port with user ""joe"", pass ""secret"" using redis version 6+ ACLs redis_url = ""redis://joe:secret@redis/0"" # connection to sentinel at localhost with default group mymaster and db 0, no password redis_url = ""redis+sentinel://localhost:26379"" # connection to sentinel at host redis with default port 26379 and user ""joe"" with password ""secret"" with default group mymaster and db 0 redis_url = ""redis+sentinel://joe:secret@redis"" # connection to sentinel, no auth with sentinel monitoring group ""zone-1"" and database 2 redis_url = ""redis+sentinel://redis:26379/zone-1/2"" # connection to redis standalone at localhost, db 0, no password but with TLS support redis_url = ""rediss://localhost:6379"" # connection to redis sentinel at localhost and default port, db 0, no password # but with TLS support for booth Sentinel and Redis server redis_url = ""rediss+sentinel://localhost"" ``` -

Here's how you can do it:

1. **Define Filters**: Use the provided filter classes like `RedisText`, `RedisNum`, and `RedisTag` to create filters based on your metadata fields.

   ```python
   from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisText, RedisNum, RedisTag

   # Example filters
   has_high_credit = RedisTag(""credit_score"") == ""high""
   age_is_over_18 = RedisNum(""age"") > 18
   ```

2. **Combine Filters**: You can combine multiple filters using logical operators.

   ```python
   from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisFilter

   # Combining filters
   is_over_18_and_high_credit = (RedisFilter.num(""age"") > 18) & (RedisFilter.tag(""credit_score"") == ""high"")
   ```

3. **Apply Filters in Search**: Pass the filter to the search method to retrieve documents that match the filter criteria.

   ```python
   results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3, filter=is_over_18_and_high_credit)
   for result in results:
       print(result.metadata)
   ```

4. **Hybrid Filtering**: You can also use a combination of text, numeric, and tag filters in a single search query.

   ```python
   from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisText

   # Example hybrid filter
   starts_with_doc = RedisText(""job"") % ""doc*""
   is_over_18 = RedisFilter.num(""age"") > 18

   results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3, filter=(starts_with_doc & is_over_18))
   for result in results:
       print(result.metadata)
   ```

By using these filter classes and combining them as needed, you can effectively search and filter metadata in your Redis vectorstore.","To perform a similarity search with metadata filtering in LangChain using the Redis vectorstore, you can use Redis filter expressions.

If the last retry fails a corresponding exception is raised. Note, that between retries an exponential backoff is applied, starting with 0.5 s after the first retry and doubling for each retry made. So with the default setting of 8 retries a total wait time of 63.5 s is added between the retries. param use_multiplicative_frequency_penalty: bool = False¶ param use_multiplicative_presence_penalty: Optional[bool] = False¶ Flag deciding whether presence penalty is applied multiplicatively (True) or additively (False). param use_multiplicative_sequence_penalty: bool = False¶ param verbose: bool [Optional]¶ Whether to print out response text. __call__(prompt: str, stop: Optional[List[str]] = None, callbacks: Optional[Union[List[BaseCallbackHandler], BaseCallbackManager]] = None, *, tags: Optional[List[str]] = None, metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None, **kwargs: Any) → str¶ Check Cache and run the LLM on the given prompt and input. async abatch(inputs: List[Union[PromptValue, str, List[BaseMessage]]], config: Optional[Union[RunnableConfig, List[RunnableConfig]]] = None, *, return_exceptions: bool = False, **kwargs: Any) → List[str]¶ Default implementation runs ainvoke in parallel using asyncio.gather. The default implementation of batch works well for IO bound runnables. Subclasses should override this method if they can batch more efficiently; e.g., if the underlying runnable uses an API which supports a batch mode. async agenerate(prompts: List[str], stop: Optional[List[str]] = None, callbacks: Union[List[BaseCallbackHandler], BaseCallbackManager, None, List[Optional[Union[List[BaseCallbackHandler], BaseCallbackManager]]]] = None, *, tags: Optional[Union[List[str], List[List[str]]]] = None, metadata: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], List[Dict[str, Any]]]] = None, run_name: Optional[Union[str, List[str]]] = None, **kwargs: Any) → LLMResult¶ Run the LLM on the given prompt and input. async agenerate_prompt(prompts: List[PromptValue], stop: Optional[List[str]] = None, callbacks: Union[List[BaseCallbackHandler], BaseCallbackManager, None, List[Optional[Union[List[BaseCallbackHandler], BaseCallbackManager]]]] = None, **kwargs: Any) → LLMResult¶ Asynchronously pass a sequence of prompts and return model generations.

Parameters prompts – List of PromptValues. A PromptValue is an object that can be converted to match the format of any language model (string for pure text generation models and BaseMessages for chat models). stop – Stop words to use when generating. Model output is cut off at the first occurrence of any of these substrings. callbacks – Callbacks to pass through.

The jsonpatch ops can be applied in order to construct state. async atransform(input: AsyncIterator[Input], config: Optional[RunnableConfig] = None, **kwargs: Optional[Any]) → AsyncIterator[Output]¶ Default implementation of atransform, which buffers input and calls astream. Subclasses should override this method if they can start producing output while input is still being generated. batch(inputs: List[Union[PromptValue, str, List[BaseMessage]]], config: Optional[Union[RunnableConfig, List[RunnableConfig]]] = None, *, return_exceptions: bool = False, **kwargs: Any) → List[str]¶ Default implementation runs invoke in parallel using a thread pool executor.

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved. I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now. It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue it\'s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables. My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\'ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use! I didn\'t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+.

However, these requests are not chained when you want to analyse them. With [Portkey](/docs/ecosystem/integrations/portkey), all the embeddings, completion, and other requests from a single user request will get logged and traced to a common ID, enabling you to gain full visibility of user interactions. This notebook serves as a step-by-step guide on how to log, trace, and monitor Langchain LLM calls using `Portkey` in your Langchain app. First, let\'s import Portkey, OpenAI, and Agent tools ```python import os from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import Portkey ``` Paste your OpenAI API key below. [(You can find it here)]( ```python os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """" ``` ## Get Portkey API Key 1. Sign up for [Portkey here]( 2. On your [dashboard]( click on the profile icon on the top left, then click on ""Copy API Key"" 3. Paste it below ```python PORTKEY_API_KEY = """" # Paste your Portkey API Key here ``` ## Set Trace ID 1. Set the trace id for your request below 2. The Trace ID can be common for all API calls originating from a single request ```python TRACE_ID = ""portkey_langchain_demo"" # Set trace id here ``` ## Generate Portkey Headers ```python headers = Portkey.Config( api_key=PORTKEY_API_KEY, trace_id=TRACE_ID, ) ``` Run your agent as usual. The **only** change is that we will **include the above headers** in the request now. ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, headers=headers) tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) # Let\'s test it out! agent.run( ""What was the high temperature in SF yesterday in Fahrenheit? What is that number raised to the .023 power?"" ) ``` ## How Logging & Tracing Works on Portkey **Logging** - Sending your request through Portkey ensures that all of the requests are logged by default - Each request log contains `timestamp`, `model name`, `total cost`, `request time`, `request json`, `response json`, and additional Portkey features **Tracing** - Trace id is passed along with each request and is visibe on the logs on Portkey dashboard - You can also set a **distinct trace id** for each request if you want - You can append user feedback to a trace id as well. [More info on this here]( ## Advanced LLMOps Features - Caching, Tagging, Retries In addition to logging and tracing, Portkey provides more features that add production capabilities to your existing workflows: **Caching** Respond to previously served customers queries from cache instead of sending them again to OpenAI. Match exact strings OR semantically similar strings. Cache can save costs and reduce latencies by 20x. **Retries** Automatically reprocess any unsuccessful API requests **upto 5** times. Uses an **exponential backoff** strategy, which spaces out retry attempts to prevent network overload. | Feature | Config Key | Value (Type) | | ---- | ---- | ---- | | Automatic Retries | retry_count | integer[1,2,3,4,5] | | Enabling Cache | cache | simpleORsemantic | **Tagging** Track and audit ach user interaction in high detail with predefined tags. | Tag | Config Key | Value (Type) | | ---- | ---- | ---- | | User Tag | user | string | | Organisation Tag | organisation | string | | Environment Tag | environment | string | | Prompt Tag (version/id/string) | prompt | string | ## Code Example With All Features ```python headers = Portkey.Config( # Mandatory api_key="""", # Cache Options cache=""semantic"", cache_force_refresh=""True"", cache_age=1729, # Advanced retry_count=5, trace_id=""langchain_agent"", # Metadata environment=""production"", user=""john"", organisation=""acme"", prompt=""Frost"", ) llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, headers=headers) print(llm(""Two roads diverged in the yellow woods"")) ``` - [Get Portkey API Key](#get-portkey-api-key) - [Set Trace ID](#set-trace-id) - [Generate Portkey Headers](#generate-portkey-headers) - [How Logging & Tracing Works on Portkey](#how-logging--tracing-works-on-portkey) - [Advanced LLMOps Features - Caching, Tagging, Retries](#advanced-llmops-features---caching-tagging-retries) - [Code Example With All Features](#code-example-with-all-features)']","To control the maximum number of concurrent requests in batch calls, you can use a thread pool executor. Here's a Python example using the `concurrent.futures` module:

```python
import concurrent.futures
from langchain.llms import AlephAlpha

# Initialize LLM
aleph_alpha = AlephAlpha(aleph_alpha_api_key=""my-api-key"")

# Define batch function
def batch_call(inputs):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:  # Set max_workers to desired concurrency
        futures = [executor.submit(aleph_alpha.abatch, input) for input in inputs]
        results = [future.result() for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures)]
    return results

# Example inputs
inputs = [""input1"", ""input2"", ""input3""]

# Call batch function
results = batch_call(inputs)
print(results)
```

In this example, `max_workers=5` limits the batch calls to 5 concurrent requests. Adjust `max_workers` as needed.","To limit the maximum number of concurrent requests for batch calls in LangChain, you can call the `.batch()` method and configure the 'max_concurrency' paramater within the runnable config.  For example, the following code calls the chain with a maximum of 2 concurrent calls:

chain.batch([{'topic': 'bears'}, {'topic': 'cats'}, {'topic': 'dogs'}], config={'max_concurrency': 2})

71,can i cache LLM calls in sqlite?,"['Caching | Caching LangChain provides an optional caching layer for LLMs. This is useful for two reasons: It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider, if you\'re often requesting the same completion multiple times. It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider. ```python from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache from langchain.llms import OpenAI # To make the caching really obvious, lets use a slower model. llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", n=2, best_of=2) ``` ## In Memory Cache ```python from langchain.cache import InMemoryCache set_llm_cache(InMemoryCache()) # The first time, it is not yet in cache, so it should take longer llm.predict(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 35.9 ms, sys: 28.6 ms, total: 64.6 ms Wall time: 4.83 s ""\\n\\nWhy couldn\'t the bicycle stand up by itself?

Note that because of certain interfaces, it\'s often easier to construct the chain first, and then edit the LLM afterwards. As an example, we will load a summarizer map-reduce chain. We will cache results for the map-step, but then not freeze it for the combine step. ```python llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"") no_cache_llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", cache=False) ``` ```python from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.chains.mapreduce import MapReduceChain text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter() ``` ```python with open(\'../../../state_of_the_union.txt\') as f: state_of_the_union = f.read() texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union) ``` ```python from langchain.docstore.document import Document docs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts[:3]] from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain ``` ```python chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"", reduce_llm=no_cache_llm) ``` ```python chain.run(docs) ``` ```text CPU times: user 452 ms, sys: 60.3 ms, total: 512 ms Wall time: 5.09 s \'\\n\\nPresident Biden is discussing the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will create jobs and help Americans.

Requires momento to use, uncomment below to install: ```python # !pip install momento ``` You\'ll need to get a Momento auth token to use this class. This can either be passed in to a momento.CacheClient if you\'d like to instantiate that directly, as a named parameter `auth_token` to `MomentoChatMessageHistory.from_client_params`, or can just be set as an environment variable `MOMENTO_AUTH_TOKEN`. ```python from datetime import timedelta from langchain.cache import MomentoCache cache_name = ""langchain"" ttl = timedelta(days=1) set_llm_cache(MomentoCache.from_client_params(cache_name, ttl)) ``` ```python # The first time, it is not yet in cache, so it should take longer llm(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 40.7 ms, sys: 16.5 ms, total: 57.2 ms Wall time: 1.73 s \'\\n\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\n\\nTo get to the other side!\' ``` ```python # The second time it is, so it goes faster # When run in the same region as the cache, latencies are single digit ms llm(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 3.16 ms, sys: 2.98 ms, total: 6.14 ms Wall time: 57.9 ms \'\\n\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\n\\nTo get to the other side!\' ``` ## SQLAlchemy Cache You can use `SQLAlchemyCache` to cache with any SQL database supported by `SQLAlchemy`. ```python # from langchain.cache import SQLAlchemyCache # from sqlalchemy import create_engine # engine = create_engine(""postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"") # set_llm_cache(SQLAlchemyCache(engine)) ``` ### Custom SQLAlchemy Schemas ```python # You can define your own declarative SQLAlchemyCache child class to customize the schema used for caching. For example, to support high-speed fulltext prompt indexing with Postgres, use: from langchain.cache import SQLAlchemyCache from sqlalchemy import Column, Computed, Index, Integer, Sequence, String, create_engine from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base from sqlalchemy_utils import TSVectorType Base = declarative_base() class FulltextLLMCache(Base): # type: ignore """"""Postgres table for fulltext-indexed LLM Cache"""""" __tablename__ = ""llm_cache_fulltext"" id = Column(Integer, Sequence(""cache_id""), primary_key=True) prompt = Column(String, nullable=False) llm = Column(String, nullable=False) idx = Column(Integer) response = Column(String) prompt_tsv = Column( TSVectorType(), Computed(""to_tsvector(\'english\', llm || \' \' || prompt)"", persisted=True), ) __table_args__ = ( Index(""idx_fulltext_prompt_tsv"", prompt_tsv, postgresql_using=""gin""), ) engine = create_engine(""postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"") set_llm_cache(SQLAlchemyCache(engine, FulltextLLMCache)) ``` ## Cassandra caches You can use Cassandra / Astra DB for caching LLM responses, choosing from the exact-match `CassandraCache` or the (vector-similarity-based) `CassandraSemanticCache`. Let\'s see both in action in the following cells. #### Connect to the DB First you need to establish a `Session` to the DB and to specify a _keyspace_ for the cache table(s). The following gets you started with an Astra DB instance (see e.g. [here]( for more backends and connection options). ```python import getpass keyspace = input(""\\nKeyspace name? "") ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN = getpass.getpass(\'\\nAstra DB Token (""AstraCS:..."") \') ASTRA_DB_SECURE_BUNDLE_PATH = input(""Full path to your Secure Connect Bundle? "") ``` ```text Keyspace name? my_keyspace Astra DB Token (""AstraCS:..."") Full path to your Secure Connect Bundle? /path/to/secure-connect-databasename.zip ``` ```python from cassandra.auth import PlainTextAuthProvider from cassandra.cluster import Cluster cluster = Cluster( cloud={ ""secure_connect_bundle"": ASTRA_DB_SECURE_BUNDLE_PATH, }, auth_provider=PlainTextAuthProvider(""token"", ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN), ) session = cluster.connect() ``` ### Exact cache This will avoid invoking the LLM when the supplied prompt is _exactly_ the same as one encountered already: ```python from langchain.cache import CassandraCache from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache set_llm_cache(CassandraCache(session=session, keyspace=keyspace)) ``` ```python print(llm(""Why is the Moon always showing the same side?"")) ``` ```text The Moon always shows the same side because it is tidally locked to Earth. CPU times: user 41.7 ms, sys: 153 µs, total: 41.8 ms Wall time: 1.96 s ``` ```python print(llm(""Why is the Moon always showing the same side?"")) ``` ```text The Moon always shows the same side because it is tidally locked to Earth. CPU times: user 4.09 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 4.09 ms Wall time: 119 ms ``` ### Semantic cache\u200b This cache will do a semantic similarity search and return a hit if it finds a cached entry that is similar enough, For this, you need to provide an `Embeddings` instance of your choice. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ```python from langchain.cache import CassandraSemanticCache set_llm_cache( CassandraSemanticCache( session=session, keyspace=keyspace, embedding=embedding, table_name=""cass_sem_cache"", ) ) ``` ```python print(llm(""Why is the Moon always showing the same side?"")) ``` ```text The Moon always shows the same side because it is tidally locked with Earth. This means that the same side of the Moon always faces Earth. CPU times: user 21.3 ms, sys: 177 µs, total: 21.4 ms Wall time: 3.09 s ``` ```python print(llm(""How come we always see one face of the moon?"")) ``` ```text The Moon always shows the same side because it is tidally locked with Earth. This means that the same side of the Moon always faces Earth. CPU times: user 10.9 ms, sys: 17 µs, total: 10.9 ms Wall time: 461 ms ``` ## Optional Caching\u200b You can also turn off caching for specific LLMs should you choose. In the example below, even though global caching is enabled, we turn it off for a specific LLM ```python llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", n=2, best_of=2, cache=False) ``` ```python llm(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 5.8 ms, sys: 2.71 ms, total: 8.51 ms Wall time: 745 ms \'\\n\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\n\\nTo get to the other side!\' ``` ```python llm(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 4.91 ms, sys: 2.64 ms, total: 7.55 ms Wall time: 623 ms \'\\n\\nTwo guys stole a calendar. They got six months each.\' ``` ## Optional Caching in Chains\u200b You can also turn off caching for particular nodes in chains. Note that because of certain interfaces, its often easier to construct the chain first, and then edit the LLM afterwards. As an example, we will load a summarizer map-reduce chain. We will cache results for the map-step, but then not freeze it for the combine step. ```python llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"") no_cache_llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", cache=False) ``` ```python from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter() ``` ```python with open(""../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") as f: state_of_the_union = f.read() texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union) ``` ```python from langchain.docstore.document import Document docs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts[:3]] from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain ``` ```python chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"", reduce_llm=no_cache_llm) ``` ```python chain.run(docs) ``` ```text CPU times: user 452 ms, sys: 60.3 ms, total: 512 ms Wall time: 5.09 s \'\\n\\nPresident Biden is discussing the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will create jobs and help Americans. He also talks about his vision for America, which includes investing in education and infrastructure. In response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, the United States is joining with European allies to impose sanctions and isolate Russia. American forces are being mobilized to protect NATO countries in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting back, but the next few weeks will be hard for them. Putin will pay a high price for his actions in the long run. Americans should not be alarmed, as the United States is taking action to protect its interests and allies.\' ``` When we run it again, we see that it runs substantially faster but the final answer is different. This is due to caching at the map steps, but not at the reduce step. ```python chain.run(docs) ``` ```text CPU times: user 11.5 ms, sys: 4.33 ms, total: 15.8 ms Wall time: 1.04 s \'\\n\\nPresident Biden is discussing the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will create jobs and help Americans.

This is ideal for building tools such as code interpreters, or Advanced Data Analysis like in ChatGPT. E2B Data Analysis sandbox allows you to: - Run Python code - Generate charts via matplotlib - Install Python packages dynamically during runtime - Install system packages dynamically during runtime - Run shell commands - Upload and download files We\'ll create a simple OpenAI agent that will use E2B\'s Data Analysis sandbox to perform analysis on a uploaded files using Python. Get your OpenAI API key and [E2B API key here]( and set them as environment variables. You can find the full API documentation [here]( You\'ll need to install `e2b` to get started: ```bash pip install langchain e2b ``` ```python import os from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import E2BDataAnalysisTool os.environ[""E2B_API_KEY""] = """" os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """" ``` When creating an instance of the `E2BDataAnalysisTool`, you can pass callbacks to listen to the output of the sandbox. This is useful, for example, when creating more responsive UI. Especially with the combination of streaming output from LLMs. ```python # Artifacts are charts created by matplotlib when `plt.show()` is called def save_artifact(artifact): print(""New matplotlib chart generated:"", artifact.name) # Download the artifact as `bytes` and leave it up to the user to display them (on frontend, for example) file = artifact.download() basename = os.path.basename(artifact.name) # Save the chart to the `charts` directory with open(f""./charts/{basename}"", ""wb"") as f: f.write(file) e2b_data_analysis_tool = E2BDataAnalysisTool( # Pass environment variables to the sandbox env_vars={""MY_SECRET"": ""secret_value""}, on_stdout=lambda stdout: print(""stdout:"", stdout), on_stderr=lambda stderr: print(""stderr:"", stderr), on_artifact=save_artifact, ) ``` Upload an example CSV data file to the sandbox so we can analyze it with our agent. You can use for example [this file]( about Netflix tv shows. ```python with open(""./netflix.csv"") as f: remote_path = e2b_data_analysis_tool.upload_file( file=f, description=""Data about Netflix tv shows including their title, category, director, release date, casting, age rating, etc."", ) print(remote_path) ``` ```text name=\'netflix.csv\' remote_path=\'/home/user/netflix.csv\' description=\'Data about Netflix tv shows including their title, category, director, release date, casting, age rating, etc.\' ``` Create a `Tool` object and initialize the Langchain agent. ```python tools = [e2b_data_analysis_tool.as_tool()] llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"", temperature=0) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS, verbose=True, handle_parsing_errors=True, ) ``` Now we can ask the agent questions about the CSV file we uploaded earlier. ```python agent.run( ""What are the 5 longest movies on netflix released between 2000 and 2010?

LangChain provides an `SQLiteCache` class that you can use to cache results in an SQLite database. Here's a brief example of how to set it up:

```python
from langchain.cache import SQLiteCache
from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache

# Set up the SQLite cache
set_llm_cache(SQLiteCache(database_path="".langchain.db""))

# Now your LLM calls will be cached in the SQLite database
llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", n=2, best_of=2)

# Example usage
llm.predict(""Tell me a joke"")
```

This will store the results of your LLM calls in the `.langchain.db` SQLite database, improving performance for subsequent calls with the same input.","To add LLM caching in sqlite, you can use the SQLiteCache class. For example:
```python
from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache
from langchain.cache import SQLiteCache
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI()

set_llm_cache(SQLiteCache(database_path="".langchain.db""))

To use, you should have the redis python package installed and have a running Redis Enterprise or Redis-Stack server For production use cases, it is recommended to use Redis Enterprise as the scaling, performance, stability and availability is much better than Redis-Stack. For testing and prototyping, however, this is not required. Redis-Stack is available as a docker container the full vector search API available. # to run redis stack in docker locally docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest Once running, you can connect to the redis server with the following url schemas: - redis://: # simple connection - redis://:@: # connection with authentication - rediss://: # connection with SSL - rediss://:@: # connection with SSL and auth Examples: The following examples show various ways to use the Redis VectorStore with LangChain. For all the following examples assume we have the following imports: from langchain.vectorstores import Redis from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings Initialize, create index, and load Documentsfrom langchain.vectorstores import Redis from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings rds = Redis.from_documents( documents, # a list of Document objects from loaders or created embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize, create index, and load Documents with metadatards = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize, create index, and load Documents with metadata and return keys rds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) For use cases where the index needs to stay alive, you can initialize with an index name such that it\'s easier to reference later rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_name=""my-index"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize and connect to an existing index (from above) rds = Redis.from_existing_index( embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_name=""my-index"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Advanced examples: Custom vector schema can be supplied to change the way that Redis creates the underlying vector schema. This is useful for production use cases where you want to optimize the vector schema for your use case. ex. using HNSW instead of FLAT (knn) which is the default vector_schema = { ""algorithm"": ""HNSW"" } rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object vector_schema=vector_schema, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Custom index schema can be supplied to change the way that the metadata is indexed. This is useful for you would like to use the hybrid querying (filtering) capability of Redis. By default, this implementation will automatically generate the index schema according to the following rules: All strings are indexed as text fields All numbers are indexed as numeric fields All lists of strings are indexed as tag fields (joined bylangchain.vectorstores.redis.constants.REDIS_TAG_SEPARATOR) All None values are not indexed but still stored in Redis these arenot retrievable through the interface here, but the raw Redis client can be used to retrieve them. All other types are not indexed To override these rules, you can pass in a custom index schema like the following tag: - name: credit_score text: - name: user - name: job Typically, the credit_score field would be a text field since it\'s a string, however, we can override this behavior by specifying the field type as shown with the yaml config (can also be a dictionary) above and the code below. rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_schema=""path/to/index_schema.yaml"", # can also be a dictionary redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) When connecting to an existing index where a custom schema has been applied, it\'s important to pass in the same schema to the from_existing_index method. Otherwise, the schema for newly added samples will be incorrect and metadata will not be returned. Initialize with necessary components.

Last updated on Nov 17, 2023. Show this page source']","To create a vectorstore from a list of texts, you can use the `ElasticsearchStore` or `Redis` classes provided in the context. Here's a brief example using `ElasticsearchStore`:

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import ElasticsearchStore
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

# Initialize embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# List of texts
texts = [""Text 1"", ""Text 2"", ""Text 3""]

# Create ElasticsearchStore
vectorstore = ElasticsearchStore(
    embedding=embeddings,
    index_name=""my_vectorstore"",
    es_url=""http://localhost:9200""  # Replace with your Elasticsearch URL
)

# Add texts to the vectorstore
vectorstore.add_texts(texts)
```

For `Redis`, the process is similar:

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Redis
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

# Initialize embeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# List of texts
texts = [""Text 1"", ""Text 2"", ""Text 3""]

# Create Redis vectorstore
vectorstore = Redis(
    embeddings=embeddings,
    redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379""  # Replace with your Redis URL
)

# Add texts to the vectorstore
vectorstore.add_texts(texts)
```

Replace the URLs with your actual Elasticsearch or Redis instance URLs.","Each LangChain vectorstore class implements a ""from_texts"" class method that accepts a list of string texts, an instance of an `Embeddings` object to embed those texts, and an optional list of metadata dictionaries to add to the resulting documents.",0.9999999999666667,1.0,,0.035332789922126386,0.16842105263157894
73,what does on_tool_start mean?,"['Defining Custom Tools | Defining Custom Tools When constructing your own agent, you will need to provide it with a list of Tools that it can use. Besides the actual function that is called, the Tool consists of several components: - `name` (str), is required and must be unique within a set of tools provided to an agent - `description` (str), is optional but recommended, as it is used by an agent to determine tool use - `return_direct` (bool), defaults to False - `args_schema` (Pydantic BaseModel), is optional but recommended, can be used to provide more information (e.g., few-shot examples) or validation for expected parameters. There are two main ways to define a tool, we will cover both in the example below. ```python # Import things that are needed generically from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.chains import LLMMathChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import BaseTool, StructuredTool, Tool, tool from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper ``` Initialize the LLM to use for the agent. ```python llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ## Completely New Tools - String Input and Output The simplest tools accept a single query string and return a string output. If your tool function requires multiple arguments, you might want to skip down to the `StructuredTool` section below. There are two ways to do this: either by using the Tool dataclass, or by subclassing the BaseTool class. ### Tool dataclass The \'Tool\' dataclass wraps functions that accept a single string input and returns a string output. ```python # Load the tool configs that are needed. search = SerpAPIWrapper() llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True) tools = [ Tool.from_function( func=search.run, name=""Search"", description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", # coroutine= ... <- you can specify an async method if desired as well ), ] ``` ```text /Users/wfh/code/lc/lckg/langchain/chains/llm_math/base.py:50: UserWarning: Directly instantiating an LLMMathChain with an llm is deprecated. Please instantiate with llm_chain argument or using the from_llm class method. warnings.warn( ``` You can also define a custom `args_schema` to provide more information about inputs. ```python from pydantic import BaseModel, Field class CalculatorInput(BaseModel): question: str = Field() tools.append( Tool.from_function( func=llm_math_chain.run, name=""Calculator"", description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"", args_schema=CalculatorInput, # coroutine= ... <- you can specify an async method if desired as well ) ) ``` ```python # Construct the agent. We will use the default agent type here. # See documentation for a full list of options. agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?

This is useful if you want more control over the instance variables or if you want to propagate callbacks to nested chains or other tools. ```python from typing import Optional, Type from langchain.callbacks.manager import ( AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun, CallbackManagerForToolRun, ) class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool): name = ""custom_search"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" def _run( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" return search.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"") class CustomCalculatorTool(BaseTool): name = ""Calculator"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"" args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = CalculatorInput def _run( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" return llm_math_chain.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""Calculator does not support async"") ``` ```python tools = [CustomSearchTool(), CustomCalculatorTool()] agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?

This decorator can be used to quickly create a `Tool` from a simple function. The decorator uses the function name as the tool name by default, but this can be overridden by passing a string as the first argument. Additionally, the decorator will use the function\'s docstring as the tool\'s description. ```python from langchain.tools import tool @tool def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return f""Results for query {query}"" search_api ``` You can also provide arguments like the tool name and whether to return directly. ```python @tool(""search"", return_direct=True) def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return ""Results"" ``` ```python search_api ``` ```text Tool(name=\'search\', description=\'search(query: str) -> str - Searches the API for the query.\', args_schema=, return_direct=True, verbose=False, callback_manager=, func=, coroutine=None) ``` You can also provide `args_schema` to provide more information about the argument. ```python class SearchInput(BaseModel): query: str = Field(description=""should be a search query"") @tool(""search"", return_direct=True, args_schema=SearchInput) def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return ""Results"" ``` ```python search_api ``` ```text Tool(name=\'search\', description=\'search(query: str) -> str - Searches the API for the query.\', args_schema=, return_direct=True, verbose=False, callback_manager=, func=, coroutine=None) ``` ## Custom Structured Tools If your functions require more structured arguments, you can use the `StructuredTool` class directly, or still subclass the `BaseTool` class. ### StructuredTool dataclass To dynamically generate a structured tool from a given function, the fastest way to get started is with `StructuredTool.from_function()`. ```python import requests from langchain.tools import StructuredTool def post_message(url: str, body: dict, parameters: Optional[dict] = None) -> str: """"""Sends a POST request to the given url with the given body and parameters."""""" result = requests.post(url, json=body, params=parameters) return f""Status: {result.status_code} - {result.text}"" tool = StructuredTool.from_function(post_message) ``` ### Subclassing the BaseTool The BaseTool automatically infers the schema from the `_run` method\'s signature. ```python from typing import Optional, Type from langchain.callbacks.manager import ( AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun, CallbackManagerForToolRun, ) class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool): name = ""custom_search"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" def _run( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" search_wrapper = SerpAPIWrapper(params={""engine"": engine, ""gl"": gl, ""hl"": hl}) return search_wrapper.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"") # You can provide a custom args schema to add descriptions or custom validation class SearchSchema(BaseModel): query: str = Field(description=""should be a search query"") engine: str = Field(description=""should be a search engine"") gl: str = Field(description=""should be a country code"") hl: str = Field(description=""should be a language code"") class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool): name = ""custom_search"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" args_schema: Type[SearchSchema] = SearchSchema def _run( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" search_wrapper = SerpAPIWrapper(params={""engine"": engine, ""gl"": gl, ""hl"": hl}) return search_wrapper.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"") ``` ### Using the decorator The `tool` decorator creates a structured tool automatically if the signature has multiple arguments. ```python import requests from langchain.tools import tool @tool def post_message(url: str, body: dict, parameters: Optional[dict] = None) -> str: """"""Sends a POST request to the given url with the given body and parameters."""""" result = requests.post(url, json=body, params=parameters) return f""Status: {result.status_code} - {result.text}"" ``` ## Modify existing tools Now, we show how to load existing tools and modify them directly. In the example below, we do something really simple and change the Search tool to have the name `Google Search`. ```python from langchain.agents import load_tools ``` ```python tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm) ``` ```python tools[0].name = ""Google Search"" ``` ```python agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?"" ) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I need to find out Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend\'s name and her age.

""The age of Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend raised to the 0.43 power is approximately 3.55."" ``` ## Defining the priorities among Tools When you made a Custom tool, you may want the Agent to use the custom tool more than normal tools. For example, you made a custom tool, which gets information on music from your database. When a user wants information on songs, You want the Agent to use `the custom tool` more than the normal `Search tool`. But the Agent might prioritize a normal Search tool. This can be accomplished by adding a statement such as `Use this more than the normal search if the question is about Music, like \'who is the singer of yesterday?\' or \'what is the most popular song in 2022?\'` to the description. An example is below. ```python # Import things that are needed generically from langchain.agents import AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent from langchain.chains import LLMMathChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper search = SerpAPIWrapper() tools = [ Tool( name=""Search"", func=search.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", ), Tool( name=""Music Search"", func=lambda x: ""\'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey."", # Mock Function description=""A Music search engine. Use this more than the normal search if the question is about Music, like \'who is the singer of yesterday?\' or \'what is the most popular song in 2022?\'"", ), ] agent = initialize_agent( tools, OpenAI(temperature=0), agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python agent.run(""what is the most famous song of christmas"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

I now know the final answer Final Answer: \'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey. > Finished chain. ""\'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey."" ``` ## Using tools to return directly Often, it can be desirable to have a tool output returned directly to the user, if it\'s called. You can do this easily with LangChain by setting the `return_direct` flag for a tool to be True. ```python llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm) tools = [ Tool( name=""Calculator"", func=llm_math_chain.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"", return_direct=True, ) ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run(""whats 2**.12"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I need to calculate this Action: Calculator Action Input: 2**.12Answer: 1.086734862526058 > Finished chain. \'Answer: 1.086734862526058\' ``` ## Handling Tool Errors When a tool encounters an error and the exception is not caught, the agent will stop executing. If you want the agent to continue execution, you can raise a `ToolException` and set `handle_tool_error` accordingly. When `ToolException` is thrown, the agent will not stop working, but will handle the exception according to the `handle_tool_error` variable of the tool, and the processing result will be returned to the agent as observation, and printed in red. You can set `handle_tool_error` to `True`, set it a unified string value, or set it as a function. If it\'s set as a function, the function should take a `ToolException` as a parameter and return a `str` value. Please note that only raising a `ToolException` won\'t be effective. You need to first set the `handle_tool_error` of the tool because its default value is `False`. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import Tool from langchain.tools.base import ToolException from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper def _handle_error(error: ToolException) -> str: return ( ""The following errors occurred during tool execution:"" + error.args[0] + ""Please try another tool."" ) def search_tool1(s: str): raise ToolException(""The search tool1 is not available."") def search_tool2(s: str): raise ToolException(""The search tool2 is not available."") search_tool3 = SerpAPIWrapper() ``` ```python description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events.You should give priority to using it."" tools = [ Tool.from_function( func=search_tool1, name=""Search_tool1"", description=description, handle_tool_error=True, ), Tool.from_function( func=search_tool2, name=""Search_tool2"", description=description, handle_tool_error=_handle_error, ), Tool.from_function( func=search_tool3.run, name=""Search_tool3"", description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", ), ] agent = initialize_agent( tools, ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python agent.run(""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

The `StringComparison` evaluators facilitate this so you can answer questions like: - Which LLM or prompt produces a preferred output for a given question? - Which examples should I include for few-shot example selection? - Which output is better to include for fine-tuning? The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `pairwise_string` evaluator. Check out the reference docs for the [PairwiseStringEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are relevant to the question asked, as they both provide a numerical answer to the question about the number of dogs in the park. However, Response A is incorrect according to the reference answer, which states that there are four dogs. Response B, on the other hand, is correct as it matches the reference answer. Neither response demonstrates depth of thought, as they both simply provide a numerical answer without any additional information or context. \\n\\nBased on these criteria, Response B is the better response.\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Methods The pairwise string evaluator can be called using [evaluate_string_pairs]( (or async [aevaluate_string_pairs]( methods, which accept: - prediction (str) The predicted response of the first model, chain, or prompt. - prediction_b (str) The predicted response of the second model, chain, or prompt. - input (str) The input question, prompt, or other text. - reference (str) (Only for the labeled_pairwise_string variant) The reference response. They return a dictionary with the following values: - value: \'A\' or \'B\', indicating whether `prediction` or `prediction_b` is preferred, respectively - score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the \'value\', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `prediction_b` is preferred. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Without References When references aren\'t available, you can still predict the preferred response. The results will reflect the evaluation model\'s preference, which is less reliable and may result in preferences that are factually incorrect. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Addition is a mathematical operation."", prediction_b=""Addition is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers to create a third number, the \'sum\'."", input=""What is addition?"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are correct and relevant to the question. However, Response B is more helpful and insightful as it provides a more detailed explanation of what addition is. Response A is correct but lacks depth as it does not explain what the operation of addition entails. \\n\\nFinal Decision: [[B]]\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Defining the Criteria By default, the LLM is instructed to select the \'preferred\' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms: - [Criteria]( enum or its string value - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions - [Constitutional principal]( - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain - Dictionary: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description. - A list of criteria or constitutional principles - to combine multiple criteria in one. Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style. ```python custom_criteria = { ""simplicity"": ""Is the language straightforward and unpretentious?"", ""clarity"": ""Are the sentences clear and easy to understand?"", ""precision"": ""Is the writing precise, with no unnecessary words or details?"", ""truthfulness"": ""Does the writing feel honest and sincere?"", ""subtext"": ""Does the writing suggest deeper meanings or themes?"", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"", criteria=custom_criteria) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Every cheerful household shares a similar rhythm of joy; but sorrow, in each household, plays a unique, haunting melody."", prediction_b=""Where one finds a symphony of joy, every domicile of happiness resounds in harmonious,"" "" identical notes; yet, every abode of despair conducts a dissonant orchestra, each"" "" playing an elegy of grief that is peculiar and profound to its own existence."", input=""Write some prose about families."", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Response A is simple, clear, and precise. It uses straightforward language to convey a deep and sincere message about families. The metaphor of joy and sorrow as music is effective and easy to understand.\\n\\nResponse B, on the other hand, is more complex and less clear. The language is more pretentious, with words like ""domicile,"" ""resounds,"" ""abode,"" ""dissonant,"" and ""elegy."" While it conveys a similar message to Response A, it does so in a more convoluted way. The precision is also lacking due to the use of unnecessary words and details.\\n\\nBoth responses suggest deeper meanings or themes about the shared joy and unique sorrow in families. However, Response A does so in a more effective and accessible way.\\n\\nTherefore, the better response is [[A]].\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` ## Customize the LLM By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain. You can customize this when loading. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"", llm=llm) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Here is my assessment:\\n\\nResponse B is more helpful, insightful, and accurate than Response A. Response B simply states ""4"", which directly answers the question by providing the exact number of dogs mentioned in the reference answer. In contrast, Response A states ""there are three dogs"", which is incorrect according to the reference answer. \\n\\nIn terms of helpfulness, Response B gives the precise number while Response A provides an inaccurate guess. For relevance, both refer to dogs in the park from the question. However, Response B is more correct and factual based on the reference answer. Response A shows some attempt at reasoning but is ultimately incorrect. Response B requires less depth of thought to simply state the factual number.\\n\\nIn summary, Response B is superior in terms of helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth. My final decision is: [[B]]\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Customize the Evaluation Prompt You can use your own custom evaluation prompt to add more task-specific instructions or to instruct the evaluator to score the output. *Note: If you use a prompt that expects generates a result in a unique format, you may also have to pass in a custom output parser (`output_parser=your_parser()`) instead of the default `PairwiseStringResultOutputParser` ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the input context, which do you prefer: A or B?

This function allows you to perform actions or logging right when a tool is about to run, providing insight into the tool execution flow. 

Here's a simple example of how it might be used:

```python
from langchain.tools import Tool

class CustomTool(Tool):
    def __init__(self, *args, on_tool_start=None, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.on_tool_start = on_tool_start

    def _run(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.on_tool_start:
            self.on_tool_start()  # Execute the on_tool_start callback
        # Tool execution logic here
        return ""Tool result""

# Define a callback function
def tool_start_callback():
    print(""Tool is starting..."")

# Create a tool instance with the callback
custom_tool = CustomTool(name=""custom_tool"", on_tool_start=tool_start_callback)

# Run the tool
custom_tool._run()
```

In this example, when `custom_tool._run()` is called, the `tool_start_callback` function will be executed first, printing ""Tool is starting..."" to the console.","The on_tool_start method is defined classes that implement LangChain's BaseCallbackHandler interface.

Specifically, it can be used for any Runnable that takes as input one of - a sequence of `BaseMessage` - a dict with a key that takes a sequence of `BaseMessage` - a dict with a key that takes the latest message(s) as a string or sequence of `BaseMessage`, and a separate key that takes historical messages And returns as output one of - a string that can be treated as the contents of an `AIMessage` - a sequence of `BaseMessage` - a dict with a key that contains a sequence of `BaseMessage` Let\'s take a look at some examples to see how it works. ## Setup We\'ll use Redis to store our chat message histories and Anthropic\'s claude-2 model so we\'ll need to install the following dependencies: ```bash pip install -U langchain redis anthropic ``` Set your [Anthropic API key]( ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""ANTHROPIC_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` Start a local Redis Stack server if we don\'t have an existing Redis deployment to connect to: ```bash docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest ``` ```python REDIS_URL = ""redis://localhost:6379/0"" ``` ### LangSmith LangSmith is especially useful for something like message history injection, where it can be hard to otherwise understand what the inputs are to various parts of the chain. Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to uncoment the below and set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python # os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" # os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Example: Dict input, message output Let\'s create a simple chain that takes a dict as input and returns a BaseMessage. In this case the `""question""` key in the input represents our input message, and the `""history""` key is where our historical messages will be injected. ```python from typing import Optional from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.memory.chat_message_histories import RedisChatMessageHistory from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder from langchain.schema.chat_history import BaseChatMessageHistory from langchain.schema.runnable.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory ``` ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You\'re an assistant who\'s good at {ability}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) chain = prompt | ChatAnthropic(model=""claude-2"") ``` ### Adding message history To add message history to our original chain we wrap it in the `RunnableWithMessageHistory` class. Crucially, we also need to define a method that takes a session_id string and based on it returns a `BaseChatMessageHistory`. Given the same input, this method should return an equivalent output. In this case we\'ll also want to specify `input_messages_key` (the key to be treated as the latest input message) and `history_messages_key` (the key to add historical messages to). ```python chain_with_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory( chain, lambda session_id: RedisChatMessageHistory(session_id, url=REDIS_URL), input_messages_key=""question"", history_messages_key=""history"", ) ``` ## Invoking with config Whenever we call our chain with message history, we need to include a config that contains the `session_id` ```python config={""configurable"": {""session_id"": """"}} ``` Given the same configuration, our chain should be pulling from the same chat message history. ```python chain_with_history.invoke( {""ability"": ""math"", ""question"": ""What does cosine mean?""}, config={""configurable"": {""session_id"": ""foobar""}}, ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\' Cosine is one of the basic trigonometric functions in mathematics.

Small fission reactors for Earth observation satellites, such as the TOPAZ nuclear reactor, have also been flown.[1] A radioisotope heater unit is powered by radioactive decay and can keep components from becoming too cold to function, potentially over a span of decades.[2] The United States tested the SNAP-10A nuclear reactor in space for 43 days in 1965,[3] with the next test of a nuclear reactor power system intended for space use occurring on 13 September 2012 with the Demonstration Using Flattop Fission (DUFF) test of the Kilopower reactor.[4] After a ground-based test of the experimental 1965 Romashka reactor, which used uranium and direct thermoelectric conversion to electricity,[5] the USSR sent about 40 nuclear-electric satellites into space, mostly powered by the BES-5 reactor. The more powerful TOPAZ-II reactor produced 10 kilowatts of electricity.[3] Examples of concepts that use nuclear power for space propulsion systems include the nuclear electric rocket (nuclear powered ion thruster(s)), the radioisotope rocket, and radioisotope electric propulsion (REP).[6] One of the more explored concepts is the nuclear thermal rocket, which was ground tested in the NERVA program. Nuclear pulse propulsion was the subject of Project Orion.[7] Regulation and hazard prevention[edit] After the ban of nuclear weapons in space by the Outer Space Treaty in 1967, nuclear power has been discussed at least since 1972 as a sensitive issue by states.[8] Particularly its potential hazards to Earth\'s environment and thus also humans has prompted states to adopt in the U.N. General Assembly the Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space (1992), particularly introducing safety principles for launches and to manage their traffic.[8] Benefits Both the Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers used RTGs for power on the surface of Mars. (Viking launch vehicle pictured) While solar power is much more commonly used, nuclear power can offer advantages in some areas. Solar cells, although efficient, can only supply energy to spacecraft in orbits where the solar flux is sufficiently high, such as low Earth orbit and interplanetary destinations close enough to the Sun. Unlike solar cells, nuclear power systems function independently of sunlight, which is necessary for deep space exploration. Nuclear-based systems can have less mass than solar cells of equivalent power, allowing more compact spacecraft that are easier to orient and direct in space. In the case of crewed spaceflight, nuclear power concepts that can power both life support and propulsion systems may reduce both cost and flight time.[9] Selected applications and/or technologies for space include: Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Radioisotope heater unit Radioisotope piezoelectric generator Radioisotope rocket Nuclear thermal rocket Nuclear pulse propulsion Nuclear electric rocket """""" docs = [ Document( page_content=split, metadata={""source"": "" ) for split in text.split(""\\n\\n"") ] ``` ```python print(map_reduce.invoke(docs[0:1], config={""max_concurrency"": 5})) ``` ```text Here is a summary that combines the key points about nuclear power in space: Nuclear power is used in space for electricity, heat, and scientific observation. The most common type is a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, which has powered space probes and lunar missions using the heat from radioactive decay. Small nuclear fission reactors have also been used to generate electricity for Earth observation satellites like the TOPAZ reactor. In addition, radioisotope heater units use radioactive decay to provide reliable heat that can keep components functioning properly over decades in the harsh space environment. Overall, nuclear power has proven useful for providing long-lasting power for space applications where solar power is not practical. Technologies like radioisotope decay heat and small fission reactors allow probes, satellites, and missions to operate far from the Sun and for extended periods by generating electricity and heat without reliance on solar energy. ``` - [Recreating with LCEL](#recreating-with-lcel) - [Example run](#example-run)']","This code creates a branching chain that routes the input based on whether there is a chat history present. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. **RunnableBranch**: This constructs a branching chain that decides which sub-chain to execute based on the input.

2. **First Branch**:
    - **RunnableLambda**: This checks if the input dictionary `x` has a key `chat_history` and returns `True` if it exists.
        - `.with_config(run_name=""HasChatHistoryCheck"")`: This sets the run name for this lambda function.
    - **conversation_chain.with_config(run_name=""RetrievalChainWithHistory"")**: This is the chain that will be executed if there is a chat history. It is configured with a run name.

3. **Second Branch**:
    - **RunnableLambda**: This extracts the value associated with the key `question` from the input dictionary `x`.
        - `.with_config(run_name=""Itemgetter:question"")`: This sets the run name for this lambda function.
    - **| retriever**: This passes the extracted `question` to the retriever.
    - `.with_config(run_name=""RetrievalChainWithNoHistory"")`: This sets the run name for the chain that retrieves information without considering chat history.

4. **Outer .with_config(run_name=""RouteDependingOnChatHistory"")**: This sets the run name for the entire branching chain.

75,How can I use OpenAI functions to get structured outputs in a chain?,"['Using OpenAI functions | Using OpenAI functions This walkthrough demonstrates how to incorporate OpenAI function-calling API\'s in a chain. We\'ll go over: 1. How to use functions to get structured outputs from ChatOpenAI 2. How to create a generic chain that uses (multiple) functions 3. How to create a chain that actually executes the chosen function ```python from typing import Optional from langchain.chains.openai_functions import ( create_openai_fn_chain, create_openai_fn_runnable, create_structured_output_chain, create_structured_output_runnable, ) from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate ``` ## Getting structured outputs We can take advantage of OpenAI functions to try and force the model to return a particular kind of structured output. We\'ll use `create_structured_output_runnable` to create our chain, which takes the desired structured output either as a Pydantic class or as JsonSchema. ### Using Pydantic classes When passing in Pydantic classes to structure our text, we need to make sure to have a docstring description for the class. It also helps to have descriptions for each of the classes attributes. ```python from langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field class Person(BaseModel): """"""Identifying information about a person."""""" name: str = Field(..., description=""The person\'s name"") age: int = Field(..., description=""The person\'s age"") fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=""The person\'s favorite food"") ``` ```python # If we pass in a model explicitly, we need to make sure it supports the OpenAI function-calling API. llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"", temperature=0) prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are a world class algorithm for extracting information in structured formats."", ), ( ""human"", ""Use the given format to extract information from the following input: {input}"", ), (""human"", ""Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format""), ] ) runnable = create_structured_output_runnable(Person, llm, prompt) runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Sally is 13""}) ``` ```text Person(name=\'Sally\', age=13, fav_food=\'Unknown\') ``` To extract arbitrarily many structured outputs of a given format, we can just create a wrapper Pydantic class that takes a sequence of the original class. ```python from typing import Sequence class People(BaseModel): """"""Identifying information about all people in a text."""""" people: Sequence[Person] = Field(..., description=""The people in the text"") runnable = create_structured_output_runnable(People, llm, prompt) runnable.invoke( { ""input"": ""Sally is 13, Joey just turned 12 and loves spinach. Caroline is 10 years older than Sally."" } ) ``` ```text People(people=[Person(name=\'Sally\', age=13, fav_food=\'\'), Person(name=\'Joey\', age=12, fav_food=\'spinach\'), Person(name=\'Caroline\', age=23, fav_food=\'\')]) ``` ### Using JsonSchema We can also pass in JsonSchema instead of Pydantic classes to specify the desired structure. When we do this, our chain will output JSON corresponding to the properties described in the JsonSchema, instead of a Pydantic class. ```python json_schema = { ""title"": ""Person"", ""description"": ""Identifying information about a person."", ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""name"": {""title"": ""Name"", ""description"": ""The person\'s name"", ""type"": ""string""}, ""age"": {""title"": ""Age"", ""description"": ""The person\'s age"", ""type"": ""integer""}, ""fav_food"": { ""title"": ""Fav Food"", ""description"": ""The person\'s favorite food"", ""type"": ""string"", }, }, ""required"": [""name"", ""age""], } ``` ```python runnable = create_structured_output_runnable(json_schema, llm, prompt) runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Sally is 13""}) ``` ```text {\'name\': \'Sally\', \'age\': 13} ``` ### [Legacy] LLMChain-based approach ```python chain = create_structured_output_chain(Person, llm, prompt, verbose=True) chain.run(""Sally is 13"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

Human: Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Sally is 13 Human: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format > Finished chain. Person(name=\'Sally\', age=13, fav_food=\'Unknown\') ``` ## Creating a generic OpenAI functions chain To create a generic OpenAI functions chain, we can use the `create_openai_fn_runnable` method. This is the same as `create_structured_output_runnable` except that instead of taking a single output schema, it takes a sequence of function definitions. Functions can be passed in as: - dicts conforming to OpenAI functions spec, - Pydantic classes, in which case they should have docstring descriptions of the function they represent and descriptions for each of the parameters, - Python functions, in which case they should have docstring descriptions of the function and args, along with type hints. ### Using Pydantic classes ```python class RecordPerson(BaseModel): """"""Record some identifying information about a pe."""""" name: str = Field(..., description=""The person\'s name"") age: int = Field(..., description=""The person\'s age"") fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=""The person\'s favorite food"") class RecordDog(BaseModel): """"""Record some identifying information about a dog."""""" name: str = Field(..., description=""The dog\'s name"") color: str = Field(..., description=""The dog\'s color"") fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=""The dog\'s favorite food"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains.openai_functions import ( convert_to_openai_function, get_openai_output_parser, ) prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a world class algorithm for recording entities.""), ( ""human"", ""Make calls to the relevant function to record the entities in the following input: {input}"", ), (""human"", ""Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format""), ] ) openai_functions = [convert_to_openai_function(f) for f in (RecordPerson, RecordDog)] llm_kwargs = {""functions"": openai_functions} if len(openai_functions) == 1: llm_kwargs[""function_call""] = {""name"": openai_functions[0][""name""]} output_parser = get_openai_output_parser((RecordPerson, RecordDog)) runnable = prompt | llm.bind(**llm_kwargs) | output_parser ``` ```python runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Harry was a chubby brown beagle who loved chicken""}) ``` ```text RecordDog(name=\'Harry\', color=\'brown\', fav_food=\'chicken\') ``` For convenience we can use the `create_openai_fn_runnable` method to help build our Runnable ```python runnable = create_openai_fn_runnable([RecordPerson, RecordDog], llm, prompt) runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Harry was a chubby brown beagle who loved chicken""}) ``` ```text RecordDog(name=\'Harry\', color=\'brown\', fav_food=\'chicken\') ``` ### Using Python functions We can pass in functions as Pydantic classes, directly as OpenAI function dicts, or Python functions. To pass Python function in directly, we\'ll want to make sure our parameters have type hints, we have a docstring, and we use [Google Python style docstrings]( to describe the parameters. **NOTE**: To use Python functions, make sure the function arguments are of primitive types (str, float, int, bool) or that they are Pydantic objects. ```python class OptionalFavFood(BaseModel): """"""Either a food or null."""""" food: Optional[str] = Field( None, description=""Either the name of a food or null. Should be null if the food isn\'t known."", ) def record_person(name: str, age: int, fav_food: OptionalFavFood) -> str: """"""Record some basic identifying information about a person.

Examples include circular reasoning, false dichotomies, ad hominem attacks, etc. Machine learning models are optimized to perform well on specific metrics like accuracy, perplexity, or loss. However, optimizing for metrics alone does not guarantee logically sound reasoning. Language models can learn to exploit flaws in reasoning to generate plausible-sounding but logically invalid arguments. When models rely on fallacies, their outputs become unreliable and untrustworthy, even if they achieve high scores on metrics. Users cannot depend on such outputs. Propagating logical fallacies can spread misinformation, confuse users, and lead to harmful real-world consequences when models are deployed in products or services. Monitoring and testing specifically for logical flaws is challenging unlike other quality issues. It requires reasoning about arguments rather than pattern matching. Therefore, it is crucial that model developers proactively address logical fallacies after optimizing metrics. Specialized techniques like causal modeling, robustness testing, and bias mitigation can help avoid flawed reasoning. Overall, allowing logical flaws to persist makes models less safe and ethical. Eliminating fallacies ensures model outputs remain logically valid and aligned with human reasoning. This maintains user trust and mitigates risks. ## Example ```python # Imports from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain_experimental.fallacy_removal.base import FallacyChain ``` ```python # Example of a model output being returned with a logical fallacy misleading_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=""""""You have to respond by using only logical fallacies inherent in your answer explanations.

76,whats the diff between a docstore and a vector store in langchain?,"['Fleet AI Libraries Context | Fleet AI Libraries Context The Fleet AI team is on a mission to embed the world\'s most important data. They\'ve started by embedding the top 1200 Python libraries to enable code generation with up-to-date knowledge. They\'ve been kind enough to share their embeddings of the [LangChain docs]( and [API reference]( Let\'s take a look at how we can use these embeddings to power a docs retrieval system and ultimately a simple code generating chain! ```bash pip install langchain fleet-context openai pandas faiss-cpu # faiss-gpu for CUDA supported GPU ``` ```python from operator import itemgetter from typing import Any, Optional, Type import pandas as pd from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.retrievers import MultiVectorRetriever from langchain.schema import Document from langchain.schema.storage import BaseStore from langchain.schema.vectorstore import VectorStore from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS def load_fleet_retriever( df: pd.DataFrame, *, vectorstore_cls: Type[VectorStore] = FAISS, docstore: Optional[BaseStore] = None, **kwargs: Any, ): vectorstore = _populate_vectorstore(df, vectorstore_cls) if docstore is None: return vectorstore.as_retriever(**kwargs) else: _populate_docstore(df, docstore) return MultiVectorRetriever( vectorstore=vectorstore, docstore=docstore, id_key=""parent"", **kwargs ) def _populate_vectorstore( df: pd.DataFrame, vectorstore_cls: Type[VectorStore], ) -> VectorStore: if not hasattr(vectorstore_cls, ""from_embeddings""): raise ValueError( f""Incompatible vector store class {vectorstore_cls}.""

But, retrieval may produce different results with subtle changes in query wording or if the embeddings do not capture the semantics of the data well. Prompt engineering / tuning is sometimes done to manually address these problems, but can be tedious. The `MultiQueryRetriever` automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents.

The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1.

Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process.

Below is an example. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, ) from langchain.schema import SystemMessage ``` We will use the [ChatPromptTemplate]( class to set up the chat prompt. The [from_messages]( method creates a `ChatPromptTemplate` from a list of messages (e.g., `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ChatMessage`, etc.) or message templates, such as the [MessagesPlaceholder]( below. The configuration below makes it so the memory will be injected to the middle of the chat prompt, in the `chat_history` key, and the user\'s inputs will be added in a human/user message to the end of the chat prompt. ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The persistent system prompt MessagesPlaceholder( variable_name=""chat_history"" ), # Where the memory will be stored. HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""{human_input}"" ), # Where the human input will injected ] ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI() chat_llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

It defines a simple chat bot in [chain.py](/docs/templates/chat_bot_feedback/chain.py) and custom evaluator that scores bot response effectiveness based on the subsequent user response. You can apply this run evaluator to your own chat bot by calling `with_config` on the chat bot before serving. You can also directly deploy your chat app using this template. [Chat bots]( are one of the most common interfaces for deploying LLMs. The quality of chat bots varies, making continuous development important. But users are wont to leave explicit feedback through mechanisms like thumbs-up or thumbs-down buttons. Furthermore, traditional analytics such as ""session length"" or ""conversation length"" often lack clarity. However, multi-turn conversations with a chat bot can provide a wealth of information, which we can transform into metrics for fine-tuning, evaluation, and product analytics. Taking [Chat Langchain]( as a case study, only about 0.04% of all queries receive explicit feedback. Yet, approximately 70% of the queries are follow-ups to previous questions. A significant portion of these follow-up queries continue useful information we can use to infer the quality of the previous AI response. This template helps solve this ""feedback scarcity"" problem. Below is an example invocation of this chat bot: []( When the user responds to this ([link]( the response evaluator is invoked, resulting in the following evaluationrun: []( As shown, the evaluator sees that the user is increasingly frustrated, indicating that the prior response was not effective ## LangSmith Feedback [LangSmith]( is a platform for building production-grade LLM applications. Beyond its debugging and offline evaluation features, LangSmith helps you capture both user and model-assisted feedback to refine your LLM application. This template uses an LLM to generate feedback for your application, which you can use to continuously improve your service. For more examples on collecting feedback using LangSmith, consult the [documentation]( ## Evaluator Implementation The user feedback is inferred by custom `RunEvaluator`. This evaluator is called using the `EvaluatorCallbackHandler`, which run it in a separate thread to avoid interfering with the chat bot\'s runtime. You can use this custom evaluator on any compatible chat bot by calling the following function on your LangChain object: ```python my_chain .with_config( callbacks=[ EvaluatorCallbackHandler( evaluators=[ ResponseEffectivenessEvaluator(evaluate_response_effectiveness) ] ) ], ) ``` The evaluator instructs an LLM, specifically `gpt-3.5-turbo`, to evaluate the AI\'s most recent chat message based on the user\'s followup response. It generates a score and accompanying reasoning that is converted to feedback in LangSmith, applied to the value provided as the `last_run_id`. The prompt used within the LLM [is available on the hub]( Feel free to customize it with things like additional app context (such as the goal of the app or the types of questions it should respond to) or ""symptoms"" you\'d like the LLM to focus on. This evaluator also utilizes OpenAI\'s function-calling API to ensure a more consistent, structured output for the grade. ## Environment Variables Ensure that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to use OpenAI models. Also, configure LangSmith by setting your `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`. ```bash export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=... export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=my-project # Set to the project you want to save to ``` ## Usage If deploying via `LangServe`, we recommend configuring the server to return callback events as well. This will ensure the backend traces are included in whatever traces you generate using the `RemoteRunnable`. ```python from chat_bot_feedback.chain import chain add_routes(app, chain, path=""/chat-bot-feedback"", include_callback_events=True) ``` With the server running, you can use the following code snippet to stream the chat bot responses for a 2 turn conversation. ```python from functools import partial from typing import Dict, Optional, Callable, List from langserve import RemoteRunnable from langchain.callbacks.manager import tracing_v2_enabled from langchain.schema import BaseMessage, AIMessage, HumanMessage # Update with the URL provided by your LangServe server chain = RemoteRunnable("" def stream_content( text: str, chat_history: Optional[List[BaseMessage]] = None, last_run_id: Optional[str] = None, on_chunk: Callable = None, ): results = [] with tracing_v2_enabled() as cb: for chunk in chain.stream( {""text"": text, ""chat_history"": chat_history, ""last_run_id"": last_run_id}, ): on_chunk(chunk) results.append(chunk) last_run_id = cb.latest_run.id if cb.latest_run else None return last_run_id, """".join(results) chat_history = [] text = ""Where are my keys?"" last_run_id, response_message = stream_content(text, on_chunk=partial(print, end="""")) print() chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=text), AIMessage(content=response_message)]) text = ""I CAN\'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE"" # The previous response will likely receive a low score, # as the user\'s frustration appears to be escalating. last_run_id, response_message = stream_content( text, chat_history=chat_history, last_run_id=str(last_run_id), on_chunk=partial(print, end=""""), ) print() chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=text), AIMessage(content=response_message)]) ``` This uses the `tracing_v2_enabled` callback manager to get the run ID of the call, which we provide in subsequent calls in the same chat thread, so the evaluator can assign feedback to the appropriate trace. ## Conclusion This template provides a simple chat bot definition you can directly deploy using LangServe. It defines a custom evaluator to log evaluation feedback for the bot without any explicit user ratings. This is an effective way to augment your analytics and to better select data points for fine-tuning and evaluation. - [LangSmith Feedback](#langsmith-feedback) - [Evaluator Implementation](#evaluator-implementation) - [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) - [Usage](#usage) - [Conclusion](#conclusion)', 'Prompt templates | Prompt templates Prompt templates are pre-defined recipes for generating prompts for language models. A template may include instructions, few-shot examples, and specific context and questions appropriate for a given task. LangChain provides tooling to create and work with prompt templates. LangChain strives to create model agnostic templates to make it easy to reuse existing templates across different language models. Typically, language models expect the prompt to either be a string or else a list of chat messages. ## PromptTemplate Use `PromptTemplate` to create a template for a string prompt. By default, `PromptTemplate` uses [Python\'s str.format]( syntax for templating. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."" ) prompt_template.format(adjective=""funny"", content=""chickens"") ``` ```text \'Tell me a funny joke about chickens.\' ``` The template supports any number of variables, including no variables: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke"") prompt_template.format() ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke\' ``` For additional validation, specify `input_variables` explicitly. These variables will be compared against the variables present in the template string during instantiation, **raising an exception if there is a mismatch**. For example: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate invalid_prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""adjective""], template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."", ) ``` ```text --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ValidationError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[19], line 3 1 from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ----> 3 invalid_prompt = PromptTemplate( 4 input_variables=[""adjective""], 5 template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."" 6 ) File ~/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/load/serializable.py:97, in Serializable.__init__(self, **kwargs) 96 def __init__(self, **kwargs: Any) -> None: ---> 97 super().__init__(**kwargs) 98 self._lc_kwargs = kwargs File ~/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pydantic/main.py:341, in pydantic.main.BaseModel.__init__() ValidationError: 1 validation error for PromptTemplate __root__ Invalid prompt schema; check for mismatched or missing input parameters. \'content\' (type=value_error) ``` You can create custom prompt templates that format the prompt in any way you want. For more information, see [Custom Prompt Templates](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/custom_prompt_template.html). ## ChatPromptTemplate The prompt to [chat models](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/models/chat) is a list of chat messages. Each chat message is associated with content, and an additional parameter called `role`. For example, in the OpenAI [Chat Completions API]( a chat message can be associated with an AI assistant, a human or a system role. Create a chat prompt template like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a helpful AI bot. Your name is {name}.""), (""human"", ""Hello, how are you doing?""), (""ai"", ""I\'m doing well, thanks!""), (""human"", ""{user_input}""), ] ) messages = chat_template.format_messages(name=""Bob"", user_input=""What is your name?"") ``` `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages` accepts a variety of message representations. For example, in addition to using the 2-tuple representation of (type, content) used above, you could pass in an instance of `MessagePromptTemplate` or `BaseMessage`. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import HumanMessagePromptTemplate from langchain.schema.messages import SystemMessage chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=( ""You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to "" ""sound more upbeat."" ) ), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{text}""), ] ) llm = ChatOpenAI() llm(chat_template.format_messages(text=""i dont like eating tasty things."")) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'I absolutely love indulging in delicious treats!\') ``` This provides you with a lot of flexibility in how you construct your chat prompts. ## LCEL `PromptTemplate` and `ChatPromptTemplate` implement the [Runnable interface](/docs/expression_language/interface), the basic building block of the [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/expression_language/). This means they support `invoke`, `ainvoke`, `stream`, `astream`, `batch`, `abatch`, `astream_log` calls. `PromptTemplate` accepts a dictionary (of the prompt variables) and returns a `StringPromptValue`. A `ChatPromptTemplate` accepts a dictionary and returns a `ChatPromptValue`. ```python prompt_val = prompt_template.invoke({""adjective"": ""funny"", ""content"": ""chickens""}) prompt_val ``` ```text StringPromptValue(text=\'Tell me a joke\') ``` ```python prompt_val.to_string() ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke\' ``` ```python prompt_val.to_messages() ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=\'Tell me a joke\')] ``` ```python chat_val = chat_template.invoke({""text"": ""i dont like eating tasty things.""}) ``` ```python chat_val.to_messages() ``` ```text [SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to sound more upbeat.""), HumanMessage(content=\'i dont like eating tasty things.\')] ``` ```python chat_val.to_string() ``` ```text ""System: You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to sound more upbeat.\\nHuman: i dont like eating tasty things."" ``` - [PromptTemplate](#prompttemplate) - [ChatPromptTemplate](#chatprompttemplate) - [LCEL](#lcel)']","To create a prompt template for your chat bot, use `ChatPromptTemplate` from LangChain. Here's a simple example:

```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# Define your chat template
chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    (""system"", ""You are a helpful AI bot.""),
    (""human"", ""Hello, how are you?"")
])

# Format the template with variables
messages = chat_template.format_messages()

# Use the messages in your chat bot
```

This sets up a basic chat template with a system message and a human input. Adjust the messages as needed for your bot's functionality.","To create a prompt template for a chat bot, you can use the `ChatPromptTemplate` class. You can initialize it with a list of chat messages, where each message has a role and content. The role can be 'system', 'human', or 'ai'. For example:

```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ('system', 'You are a helpful AI bot. Your name is {name}.'),
        ('human', 'Hello, how are you doing?'),
        ('ai', 'I'm doing well, thanks!'),
        ('human', '{user_input}'),
    ]
)

messages = chat_template.format_messages(name='Bob', user_input='What is your name?')
```

You can also use different subclasses of the `ChatMessagePromptTemplate` class, such as `SystemMessagePromptTemplate` and `HumanMessagePromptTemplate`, to customize the role or content of specific messages in the template. Finally, you can use the ""MessagesPlaceholder"" class to format chat history as a sequence of messages.",0.9999999999666667,,1.0,0.4285920398668233,0.42152466367713004

A RunnableRetry helps can be used to add retry logic to any object that subclasses the base Runnable. Such retries are especially useful for network calls that may fail due to transient errors. The RunnableRetry is implemented as a RunnableBinding. The easiest way to use it is through the .with_retry() method on all Runnables. Example: Here\'s an example that uses a RunnableLambda to raise an exception import time def foo(input) -> None: \'\'\'Fake function that raises an exception.\'\'\' raise ValueError(""Invoking foo failed. At time {time.time()}"") runnable = RunnableLambda(foo) runnable_with_retries = runnable.with_retry( retry_exception_types=(ValueError,), # Retry only on ValueError wait_exponential_jitter=True, # Add jitter to the exponential backoff max_attempt_number=2, # Try twice ) # The method invocation above is equivalent to the longer form below: runnable_with_retries = RunnableRetry( bound=runnable, retry_exception_types=(ValueError,), max_attempt_number=2, wait_exponential_jitter=True ) This logic can be used to retry any Runnable, including a chain of Runnables, but in general it\'s best practice to keep the scope of the retry as small as possible. For example, if you have a chain of Runnables, you should only retry the Runnable that is likely to fail, not the entire chain. Example from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate template = PromptTemplate.from_template(""tell me a joke about {topic}."") model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.5) # Good chain = template | model.with_retry() # Bad chain = template | model retryable_chain = chain.with_retry() Create a new model by parsing and validating input data from keyword arguments. Raises ValidationError if the input data cannot be parsed to form a valid model. param bound: Runnable[Input, Output] [Required] param config: RunnableConfig [Optional] param config_factories: List[Callable[[RunnableConfig], RunnableConfig]] [Optional] param custom_input_type: Optional[Any] = None param custom_output_type: Optional[Any] = None param kwargs: Mapping[str, Any] [Optional] param max_attempt_number: int = 3 The maximum number of attempts to retry the runnable. param retry_exception_types: Tuple[Type[BaseException], ...] = (,) The exception types to retry on.

80,what does runnable mean,"['Agent Trajectory | Agent Trajectory []( Agents can be difficult to holistically evaluate due to the breadth of actions and generation they can make. We recommend using multiple evaluation techniques appropriate to your use case. One way to evaluate an agent is to look at the whole trajectory of actions taken along with their responses. Evaluators that do this can implement the `AgentTrajectoryEvaluator` interface. This walkthrough will show how to use the `trajectory` evaluator to grade an OpenAI functions agent. For more information, check out the reference docs for the [TrajectoryEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""trajectory"") ``` ## Methods The Agent Trajectory Evaluators are used with the [evaluate_agent_trajectory]( (and async [aevaluate_agent_trajectory]( methods, which accept: - input (str) The input to the agent. - prediction (str) The final predicted response. - agent_trajectory (List[Tuple [AgentAction, str] ]) The intermediate steps forming the agent trajectory They return a dictionary with the following values: - score: Float from 0 to 1, where 1 would mean ""most effective"" and 0 would mean ""least effective"" - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Capturing Trajectory The easiest way to return an agent\'s trajectory (without using tracing callbacks like those in LangSmith) for evaluation is to initialize the agent with `return_intermediate_steps=True`. Below, create an example agent we will call to evaluate. ```python import subprocess from urllib.parse import urlparse from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import tool from pydantic import HttpUrl @tool def ping(url: HttpUrl, return_error: bool) -> str: """"""Ping the fully specified url.

The `StringComparison` evaluators facilitate this so you can answer questions like: - Which LLM or prompt produces a preferred output for a given question? - Which examples should I include for few-shot example selection? - Which output is better to include for fine-tuning? The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `pairwise_string` evaluator. Check out the reference docs for the [PairwiseStringEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are relevant to the question asked, as they both provide a numerical answer to the question about the number of dogs in the park. However, Response A is incorrect according to the reference answer, which states that there are four dogs. Response B, on the other hand, is correct as it matches the reference answer. Neither response demonstrates depth of thought, as they both simply provide a numerical answer without any additional information or context. \\n\\nBased on these criteria, Response B is the better response.\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Methods The pairwise string evaluator can be called using [evaluate_string_pairs]( (or async [aevaluate_string_pairs]( methods, which accept: - prediction (str) The predicted response of the first model, chain, or prompt. - prediction_b (str) The predicted response of the second model, chain, or prompt. - input (str) The input question, prompt, or other text. - reference (str) (Only for the labeled_pairwise_string variant) The reference response. They return a dictionary with the following values: - value: \'A\' or \'B\', indicating whether `prediction` or `prediction_b` is preferred, respectively - score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the \'value\', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `prediction_b` is preferred. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Without References When references aren\'t available, you can still predict the preferred response. The results will reflect the evaluation model\'s preference, which is less reliable and may result in preferences that are factually incorrect. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Addition is a mathematical operation."", prediction_b=""Addition is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers to create a third number, the \'sum\'."", input=""What is addition?"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are correct and relevant to the question. However, Response B is more helpful and insightful as it provides a more detailed explanation of what addition is. Response A is correct but lacks depth as it does not explain what the operation of addition entails. \\n\\nFinal Decision: [[B]]\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Defining the Criteria By default, the LLM is instructed to select the \'preferred\' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms: - [Criteria]( enum or its string value - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions - [Constitutional principal]( - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain - Dictionary: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description. - A list of criteria or constitutional principles - to combine multiple criteria in one. Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style. ```python custom_criteria = { ""simplicity"": ""Is the language straightforward and unpretentious?"", ""clarity"": ""Are the sentences clear and easy to understand?"", ""precision"": ""Is the writing precise, with no unnecessary words or details?"", ""truthfulness"": ""Does the writing feel honest and sincere?"", ""subtext"": ""Does the writing suggest deeper meanings or themes?"", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"", criteria=custom_criteria) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Every cheerful household shares a similar rhythm of joy; but sorrow, in each household, plays a unique, haunting melody."", prediction_b=""Where one finds a symphony of joy, every domicile of happiness resounds in harmonious,"" "" identical notes; yet, every abode of despair conducts a dissonant orchestra, each"" "" playing an elegy of grief that is peculiar and profound to its own existence."", input=""Write some prose about families."", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Response A is simple, clear, and precise. It uses straightforward language to convey a deep and sincere message about families. The metaphor of joy and sorrow as music is effective and easy to understand.\\n\\nResponse B, on the other hand, is more complex and less clear. The language is more pretentious, with words like ""domicile,"" ""resounds,"" ""abode,"" ""dissonant,"" and ""elegy."" While it conveys a similar message to Response A, it does so in a more convoluted way. The precision is also lacking due to the use of unnecessary words and details.\\n\\nBoth responses suggest deeper meanings or themes about the shared joy and unique sorrow in families. However, Response A does so in a more effective and accessible way.\\n\\nTherefore, the better response is [[A]].\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` ## Customize the LLM By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain. You can customize this when loading. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"", llm=llm) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Here is my assessment:\\n\\nResponse B is more helpful, insightful, and accurate than Response A. Response B simply states ""4"", which directly answers the question by providing the exact number of dogs mentioned in the reference answer. In contrast, Response A states ""there are three dogs"", which is incorrect according to the reference answer. \\n\\nIn terms of helpfulness, Response B gives the precise number while Response A provides an inaccurate guess. For relevance, both refer to dogs in the park from the question. However, Response B is more correct and factual based on the reference answer. Response A shows some attempt at reasoning but is ultimately incorrect. Response B requires less depth of thought to simply state the factual number.\\n\\nIn summary, Response B is superior in terms of helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth.

LLMs are a great tool for this given their proficiency in understanding and synthesizing text. In this walkthrough we\'ll go over how to perform document summarization using LLMs. ![Image description](/assets/images/summarization_use_case_1-cdb1b94b53af261bd997a9934a8c3703.png) ## Overview A central question for building a summarizer is how to pass your documents into the LLM\'s context window. Two common approaches for this are: 1. `Stuff`: Simply ""stuff"" all your documents into a single prompt. This is the simplest approach (see [here](/docs/modules/chains/document/stuff) for more on the `StuffDocumentsChains`, which is used for this method). 2. `Map-reduce`: Summarize each document on it\'s own in a ""map"" step and then ""reduce"" the summaries into a final summary (see [here](/docs/modules/chains/document/map_reduce) for more on the `MapReduceDocumentsChain`, which is used for this method). ![Image description](/assets/images/summarization_use_case_2-f2a4d5d60980a79140085fb7f8043217.png) ## Quickstart To give you a sneak preview, either pipeline can be wrapped in a single object: `load_summarize_chain`. Suppose we want to summarize a blog post. We can create this in a few lines of code. First set environment variables and install packages: ```bash pip install openai tiktoken chromadb langchain # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file # import dotenv #

Stuff\u200b When we use `load_summarize_chain` with `chain_type=""stuff""`, we will use the [StuffDocumentsChain](/docs/modules/chains/document/stuff). The chain will take a list of documents, inserts them all into a prompt, and passes that prompt to an LLM: ```python from langchain.chains.combine_documents.stuff import StuffDocumentsChain from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate # Define prompt prompt_template = """"""Write a concise summary of the following: ""{text}"" CONCISE SUMMARY:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template) # Define LLM chain llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"") llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) # Define StuffDocumentsChain stuff_chain = StuffDocumentsChain(llm_chain=llm_chain, document_variable_name=""text"") docs = loader.load() print(stuff_chain.run(docs)) ``` ```text The article discusses the concept of building autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs).

We can see that we reproduce the earlier result using the `load_summarize_chain`. ### Go deeper\u200b - You can easily customize the prompt. - You can easily try different LLMs, (e.g., [Claude](/docs/integrations/chat/anthropic)) via the `llm` parameter. ## Option 2. Map-Reduce\u200b Let\'s unpack the map reduce approach. For this, we\'ll first map each document to an individual summary using an `LLMChain`. Then we\'ll use a `ReduceDocumentsChain` to combine those summaries into a single global summary. First, we specify the LLMChain to use for mapping each document to an individual summary: ```python from langchain.chains import MapReduceDocumentsChain, ReduceDocumentsChain from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) # Map map_template = """"""The following is a set of documents {docs} Based on this list of docs, please identify the main themes Helpful Answer:"""""" map_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(map_template) map_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=map_prompt) ``` We can also use the Prompt Hub to store and fetch prompts. This will work with your [LangSmith API key]( For example, see the map prompt [here]( ```python from langchain import hub map_prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/map-prompt"") map_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=map_prompt) ``` The `ReduceDocumentsChain` handles taking the document mapping results and reducing them into a single output. It wraps a generic `CombineDocumentsChain` (like `StuffDocumentsChain`) but adds the ability to collapse documents before passing it to the `CombineDocumentsChain` if their cumulative size exceeds `token_max`. In this example, we can actually re-use our chain for combining our docs to also collapse our docs. So if the cumulative number of tokens in our mapped documents exceeds 4000 tokens, then we\'ll recursively pass in the documents in batches of < 4000 tokens to our `StuffDocumentsChain` to create batched summaries. And once those batched summaries are cumulatively less than 4000 tokens, we\'ll pass them all one last time to the `StuffDocumentsChain` to create the final summary. ```python # Reduce reduce_template = """"""The following is set of summaries: {doc_summaries} Take these and distill it into a final, consolidated summary of the main themes. Helpful Answer:"""""" reduce_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(reduce_template) ``` ```python # Note we can also get this from the prompt hub, as noted above reduce_prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/map-prompt"") ``` ```python reduce_prompt ``` ```text ChatPromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'docs\'], messages=[HumanMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'docs\'], template=\'The following is a set of documents:\\n{docs}\\nBased on this list of docs, please identify the main themes \\nHelpful Answer:\'))]) ``` ```python # Run chain reduce_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=reduce_prompt) # Takes a list of documents, combines them into a single string, and passes this to an LLMChain combine_documents_chain = StuffDocumentsChain( llm_chain=reduce_chain, document_variable_name=""docs"" ) # Combines and iteravely reduces the mapped documents reduce_documents_chain = ReduceDocumentsChain( # This is final chain that is called. combine_documents_chain=combine_documents_chain, # If documents exceed context for `StuffDocumentsChain` collapse_documents_chain=combine_documents_chain, # The maximum number of tokens to group documents into. token_max=4000, ) ``` Combining our map and reduce chains into one: ```python # Combining documents by mapping a chain over them, then combining results map_reduce_chain = MapReduceDocumentsChain( # Map chain llm_chain=map_chain, # Reduce chain reduce_documents_chain=reduce_documents_chain, # The variable name in the llm_chain to put the documents in document_variable_name=""docs"", # Return the results of the map steps in the output return_intermediate_steps=False, ) text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0 ) split_docs = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```text Created a chunk of size 1003, which is longer than the specified 1000 ``` ```python print(map_reduce_chain.run(split_docs)) ``` ```text Based on the list of documents provided, the main themes can be identified as follows: 1. LLM-powered autonomous agents: The documents discuss the concept of building agents with LLM as their core controller and highlight the potential of LLM beyond generating written content. They explore the capabilities of LLM as a general problem solver. 2. Agent system overview: The documents provide an overview of the components that make up a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, including planning, memory, and tool use. Each component is explained in detail, highlighting its role in enhancing the agent\'s capabilities. 3. Planning: The documents discuss how the agent breaks down large tasks into smaller subgoals and utilizes self-reflection to improve the quality of its actions and results. 4. Memory: The documents explain the importance of both short-term and long-term memory in an agent system. Short-term memory is utilized for in-context learning, while long-term memory allows the agent to retain and recall information over extended periods. 5. Tool use: The documents highlight the agent\'s ability to call external APIs for additional information and resources that may be missing from its pre-trained model weights. This includes accessing current information, executing code, and retrieving proprietary information. 6. Case studies and proof-of-concept examples: The documents provide examples of how LLM-powered autonomous agents can be applied in various domains, such as scientific discovery and generative agent simulations. These case studies serve as examples of the capabilities and potential applications of such agents. 7. Challenges: The documents acknowledge the challenges associated with building and utilizing LLM-powered autonomous agents, although specific challenges are not mentioned in the given set of documents. 8. Citation and references: The documents include a citation and reference section, indicating that the information presented is based on existing research and sources. Overall, the main themes in the provided documents revolve around LLM-powered autonomous agents, their components and capabilities, planning, memory, tool use, case studies, and challenges. ``` ### Go deeper\u200b **Customization** - As shown above, you can customize the LLMs and prompts for map and reduce stages. **Real-world use-case** - See [this blog post]( case-study on analyzing user interactions (questions about LangChain documentation)! - The blog post and associated [repo]( also introduce clustering as a means of summarization. - This opens up a third path beyond the `stuff` or `map-reduce` approaches that is worth considering. ![Image description](/assets/images/summarization_use_case_3-4247e4011d0a52901288005bfaf20dc1.png) ## Option 3. Refine\u200b [Refine](/docs/modules/chains/document/refine) is similar to map-reduce: The refine documents chain constructs a response by looping over the input documents and iteratively updating its answer. For each document, it passes all non-document inputs, the current document, and the latest intermediate answer to an LLM chain to get a new answer. This can be easily run with the `chain_type=""refine""` specified. ```python chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""refine"") chain.run(split_docs) ``` ```text \'The article explores the concept of building autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) and their potential as problem solvers.

Esplora i diversi componenti di un sistema di agenti alimentato da LLM, tra cui la pianificazione, la memoria e l\'uso degli strumenti. Dimostrazioni di concetto come AutoGPT mostrano il potenziale di LLM come risolutore generale di problemi. Approcci come Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, LLM+P, ReAct e Reflexion consentono agli agenti autonomi di pianificare, riflettere su se stessi e migliorarsi iterativamente. Tuttavia, ci sono sfide da affrontare, come la limitata capacità di contesto che limita l\'inclusione di informazioni storiche dettagliate e la difficoltà di pianificazione a lungo termine e decomposizione delle attività. Inoltre, l\'affidabilità dell\'interfaccia di linguaggio naturale tra LLM e componenti esterni come la memoria e gli strumenti è incerta, poiché i LLM possono commettere errori di formattazione e mostrare comportamenti ribelli. Nonostante ciò, il sistema AutoGPT viene menzionato come esempio di dimostrazione di concetto che utilizza LLM come controller principale per agenti autonomi.

How can I print out the filled out prompts for each model call?","['Prompt + LLM | Prompt + LLM The most common and valuable composition is taking: `PromptTemplate` / `ChatPromptTemplate` -> `LLM` / `ChatModel` -> `OutputParser` Almost any other chains you build will use this building block. ## PromptTemplate + LLM The simplest composition is just combining a prompt and model to create a chain that takes user input, adds it to a prompt, passes it to a model, and returns the raw model output. Note, you can mix and match PromptTemplate/ChatPromptTemplates and LLMs/ChatModels as you like here. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""tell me a joke about {foo}"") model = ChatOpenAI() chain = prompt | model ``` ```python chain.invoke({""foo"": ""bears""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""Why don\'t bears wear shoes?\\n\\nBecause they have bear feet!"", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` Often times we want to attach kwargs that\'ll be passed to each model call. Here are a few examples of that: ### Attaching Stop Sequences ```python chain = prompt | model.bind(stop=[""\\n""]) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""foo"": ""bears""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'Why did the bear never wear shoes?\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` ### Attaching Function Call information ```python functions = [ { ""name"": ""joke"", ""description"": ""A joke"", ""parameters"": { ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""setup"": {""type"": ""string"", ""description"": ""The setup for the joke""}, ""punchline"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""description"": ""The punchline for the joke"", }, }, ""required"": [""setup"", ""punchline""], }, } ] chain = prompt | model.bind(function_call={""name"": ""joke""}, functions=functions) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""foo"": ""bears""}, config={}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={\'function_call\': {\'name\': \'joke\', \'arguments\': \'{\\n ""setup"": ""Why don\\\'t bears wear shoes?"",\\n ""punchline"": ""Because they have bear feet!""\\n}\'}}, example=False) ``` ## PromptTemplate + LLM + OutputParser We can also add in an output parser to easily transform the raw LLM/ChatModel output into a more workable format ```python from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chain = prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ``` Notice that this now returns a string - a much more workable format for downstream tasks ```python chain.invoke({""foo"": ""bears""}) ``` ```text ""Why don\'t bears wear shoes?\\n\\nBecause they have bear feet!"" ``` ### Functions Output Parser When you specify the function to return, you may just want to parse that directly ```python from langchain.output_parsers.openai_functions import JsonOutputFunctionsParser chain = ( prompt | model.bind(function_call={""name"": ""joke""}, functions=functions) | JsonOutputFunctionsParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""foo"": ""bears""}) ``` ```text {\'setup\': ""Why don\'t bears like fast food?"", \'punchline\': ""Because they can\'t catch it!""} ``` ```python from langchain.output_parsers.openai_functions import JsonKeyOutputFunctionsParser chain = ( prompt | model.bind(function_call={""name"": ""joke""}, functions=functions) | JsonKeyOutputFunctionsParser(key_name=""setup"") ) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""foo"": ""bears""}) ``` ```text ""Why don\'t bears wear shoes?"" ``` ## Simplifying input To make invocation even simpler, we can add a `RunnableMap` to take care of creating the prompt input dict for us: ```python from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableMap, RunnablePassthrough map_ = RunnableMap(foo=RunnablePassthrough()) chain = ( map_ | prompt | model.bind(function_call={""name"": ""joke""}, functions=functions) | JsonKeyOutputFunctionsParser(key_name=""setup"") ) ``` ```python chain.invoke(""bears"") ``` ```text ""Why don\'t bears wear shoes?"" ``` Since we\'re composing our map with another Runnable, we can even use some syntactic sugar and just use a dict: ```python chain = ( {""foo"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | model.bind(function_call={""name"": ""joke""}, functions=functions) | JsonKeyOutputFunctionsParser(key_name=""setup"") ) ``` ```python chain.invoke(""bears"") ``` ```text ""Why don\'t bears like fast food?"" ``` - [PromptTemplate + LLM](#prompttemplate--llm)- [Attaching Stop Sequences](#attaching-stop-sequences) - [Attaching Function Call information](#attaching-function-call-information) - [PromptTemplate + LLM + OutputParser](#prompttemplate--llm--outputparser)- [Functions Output Parser](#functions-output-parser) - [Simplifying input](#simplifying-input)', 'Bind runtime args | Bind runtime args Sometimes we want to invoke a Runnable within a Runnable sequence with constant arguments that are not part of the output of the preceding Runnable in the sequence, and which are not part of the user input. We can use `Runnable.bind()` to easily pass these arguments in. Suppose we have a simple prompt + model sequence: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough ``` ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""Write out the following equation using algebraic symbols then solve it.

RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer: ``` We\'ll use the [LCEL Runnable]( protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box ```python from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python for chunk in rag_chain.stream(""What is Task Decomposition?""): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Task decomposition can be performed by AI models with prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ### Go deeper #### Choosing LLMs `ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model wrapper.

There are two main things we need to do to support this. 1. Add a messages placeholder to our chain which allows us to pass in historical messages 2. Add a chain that takes the latest user query and reformulates it in the context of the chat history into a standalone question that can be passed to our retriever. Let\'s start with 2. We can build a ""condense question"" chain that looks something like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder condense_q_system_prompt = """"""Given a chat history and the latest user question \\ which might reference the chat history, formulate a standalone question \\ which can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \\ just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."""""" condense_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", condense_q_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) condense_q_chain = condense_q_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""What is meant by large"", } ) ``` ```text \'What is the definition of ""large"" in the context of a language model?\' ``` ```python condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""How do transformers work"", } ) ``` ```text \'How do transformer models function?\' ``` And now we can build our full QA chain. Notice we add some routing functionality to only run the ""condense question chain"" when our chat history isn\'t empty. ```python qa_system_prompt = """"""You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \\ Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. \\ If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. \\ Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\ {context}"""""" qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", qa_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) def condense_question(input: dict): if input.get(""chat_history""): return condense_q_chain else: return input[""question""] rag_chain = ( RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=condense_question | retriever | format_docs) | qa_prompt | llm ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] question = ""What is Task Decomposition?"" ai_msg = rag_chain.invoke({""question"": question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=question), ai_msg]) second_question = ""What are common ways of doing it?"" rag_chain.invoke({""question"": second_question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'Common ways of task decomposition include:\\n\\n1.

For example, for writing a novel, the instruction ""Write a story outline"" can be given to break down the task into manageable steps.\\n\\n4.

This will return the values passed to each component in the chain. Here's how you can do it:

```python
results = chain.invoke({""input"": ""your input here""}, return_values=True)

for i, result in enumerate(results):
    print(f""Model call {i+1} output: {result}"")
```

In this example, `results` will contain the output of each model call in the order they appear in the chain. By iterating over `results`, you can print out the filled out prompts for each model call.

If you want to access the specific prompts used, you might need to modify your chain to store or return the prompts explicitly. For example:

```python
def print_prompts(chain, input_data):
    for i, component in enumerate(chain):
        if isinstance(component, RunnablePassthrough):
            output = component.invoke(input_data, return_values=True)
            print(f""Model call {i+1} output: {output}"")
        else:
            print(f""Model call {i+1} prompt: {component.get_prompt()}"")

print_prompts(chain, {""input"": ""your input here""})
```

This will print the prompts for each model call if they are available. Adjust the logic based on how your chain and components are structured.","There are a few options. You can use set_debug(True) to print out each run to the console:
```
from langchain.globals import set_debug

This means that the information most relevant to a query may be buried in a document with a lot of irrelevant text. Passing that full document through your application can lead to more expensive LLM calls and poorer responses. Contextual compression is meant to fix this. The idea is simple: instead of immediately returning retrieved documents as-is, you can compress them using the context of the given query, so that only the relevant information is returned. Compressing here refers to both compressing the contents of an individual document and filtering out documents wholesale. To use the Contextual Compression Retriever, you\'ll need: - a base retriever - a Document Compressor The Contextual Compression Retriever passes queries to the base retriever, takes the initial documents and passes them through the Document Compressor. The Document Compressor takes a list of documents and shortens it by reducing the contents of documents or dropping documents altogether. ![]( ## Get started ```python # Helper function for printing docs def pretty_print_docs(docs): print(f""\\n{\'-\' * 100}\\n"".join([f""Document {i+1}:\\n\\n"" + d.page_content for i, d in enumerate(docs)])) ``` ## Using a vanilla vector store retriever Let\'s start by initializing a simple vector store retriever and storing the 2023 State of the Union speech (in chunks). We can see that given an example question our retriever returns one or two relevant docs and a few irrelevant docs. And even the relevant docs have a lot of irrelevant information in them. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS documents = TextLoader(\'../../../state_of_the_union.txt\').load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) retriever = FAISS.from_documents(texts, OpenAIEmbeddings()).as_retriever() docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"") pretty_print_docs(docs) ``` ```text Document 1: Tonight.

Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

While it often appears that we never agree, that isn\'t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. And soon, we\'ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.

And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up. That ends on my watch. Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. We\'ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. Let\'s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave. Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. Let\'s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jillour First Lady who teaches full-timecalls America\'s best-kept secret: community colleges. ``` ## Adding contextual compression with an LLMChainExtractor Now let\'s wrap our base retriever with a `ContextualCompressionRetriever`. We\'ll add an `LLMChainExtractor`, which will iterate over the initially returned documents and extract from each only the content that is relevant to the query. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import LLMChainExtractor llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) compressor = LLMChainExtractor.from_llm(llm) compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(base_compressor=compressor, base_retriever=retriever) compressed_docs = compression_retriever.get_relevant_documents(""What did the president say about Ketanji Jackson Brown"") pretty_print_docs(compressed_docs) ``` ```text Document 1: ""One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

While it often appears that we never agree, that isnt true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. And soon, well strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. So tonight Im offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together. First, beat the opioid epidemic. ``` # Stringing compressors and document transformers together Using the `DocumentCompressorPipeline` we can also easily combine multiple compressors in sequence. Along with compressors we can add `BaseDocumentTransformer`s to our pipeline, which don\'t perform any contextual compression but simply perform some transformation on a set of documents. For example `TextSplitter`s can be used as document transformers to split documents into smaller pieces, and the `EmbeddingsRedundantFilter` can be used to filter out redundant documents based on embedding similarity between documents. Below we create a compressor pipeline by first splitting our docs into smaller chunks, then removing redundant documents, and then filtering based on relevance to the query. ```python from langchain.document_transformers import EmbeddingsRedundantFilter from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import DocumentCompressorPipeline from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=300, chunk_overlap=0, separator="". "") redundant_filter = EmbeddingsRedundantFilter(embeddings=embeddings) relevant_filter = EmbeddingsFilter(embeddings=embeddings, similarity_threshold=0.76) pipeline_compressor = DocumentCompressorPipeline( transformers=[splitter, redundant_filter, relevant_filter] ) ``` ```python compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(base_compressor=pipeline_compressor, base_retriever=retriever) compressed_docs = compression_retriever.get_relevant_documents(""What did the president say about Ketanji Jackson Brown"") pretty_print_docs(compressed_docs) ``` ```text Document 1: One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

Specifically, you can specify the number of top documents to retrieve by using the `k` parameter. Here's an example:

```python
retriever = MultiVectorRetriever(
    vectorstore=vectorstore,
    docstore=store,
    id_key=id_key,
    k=10  # Retrieve top 10 documents

For similarity thresholds, the `MultiVectorRetriever` may not directly support this feature out of the box. However, you can implement custom logic to filter documents based on similarity scores after retrieval. This would involve retrieving the documents first and then applying a threshold filter based on the similarity scores obtained.

The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1. Simple prompting: Agents can use Language Model based prompting to break down tasks into subgoals. For example, by providing prompts like ""Steps for XYZ"" or ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", the agent can generate a sequence of smaller steps that lead to the completion of the overall task.\\n\\n2. Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to ""Write a story outline."" This provides a high-level structure for the task and helps in breaking it down into smaller components.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Agents can also take inputs from humans to decompose tasks. This can be done through direct communication or by leveraging human expertise. Humans can provide guidance and insights to help the agent break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals.\\n\\nOverall, task decomposition allows agents to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals, enabling them to plan and execute complex tasks efficiently.\'} ``` ```python qa(""What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'The human asks how agents use task decomposition.

Long-Term Memory Management: This involves storing and organizing information in a long-term memory system. The agent can retrieve past experiences, knowledge, and learned strategies to guide the task decomposition process.\\n\\n2. Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents. This allows for easy retrieval and reference during the execution of the task.\\n\\nThese memory resources help the agent in organizing and managing information, making informed decisions, and effectively decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals.\'} ``` Again, we can use the [LangSmith trace]( to explore the prompt structure. ### Going deeper - Agents, such as the [conversational retrieval agent](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents), can be used for retrieval when necessary while also holding a conversation. - [Use case](#use-case) - [Overview](#overview) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Memory](#memory) - [Conversation](#conversation) - [Chat Retrieval](#chat-retrieval)- [Going deeper](#going-deeper)']","To use a prompt template with chat history in LangChain, you can combine a `ChatPromptTemplate` with `ConversationBufferMemory`. Here's a simple example:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate

# Initialize memory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True)

# Define the prompt template
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human.""),
    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""),
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}"")
])

# Initialize the chat model
chat = ChatOpenAI()

# Create a chain with the prompt and memory
conversation = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory)

# Run the chain with a question
response = conversation.run({""question"": ""hi""})
print(response)
```

In this example, `ConversationBufferMemory` stores the chat history, and `MessagesPlaceholder` inserts the chat history into the prompt template. The `LLMChain` uses the chat model to generate responses based on the prompt and memory.","To add chat history to a prompt template, you can use the MessagesPlaceholder class.

```
from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder, ChatPromptTemplate

chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (""system"", ""You are a helpful AI bot.""),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history"")
        (""human"", ""{input}""),
    ]
)

Then, specify the path that you downloaded to to. E.g., for me, the model lives here: `/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/gpt4all/models/nous-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin` ```python from langchain.llms import GPT4All llm = GPT4All( model=""/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/gpt4all/models/nous-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin"", max_tokens=2048, ) ``` ## LLMChain Run an `LLMChain` (see [here]( with either model by passing in the retrieved docs and a simple prompt. It formats the prompt template using the input key values provided and passes the formatted string to `GPT4All`, `LLama-V2`, or another specified LLM. In this case, the list of retrieved documents (`docs`) above are pass into `{context}`. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate # Prompt prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""Summarize the main themes in these retrieved docs: {docs}"" ) # Chain llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) # Run question = ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(question) result = llm_chain(docs) # Output result[""text""] ``` ```text Llama.generate: prefix-match hit Based on the retrieved documents, the main themes are: 1. Task decomposition: The ability to break down complex tasks into smaller subtasks, which can be handled by an LLM or other components of the agent system. 2. LLM as the core controller: The use of a large language model (LLM) as the primary controller of an autonomous agent system, complemented by other key components such as a knowledge graph and a planner. 3. Potentiality of LLM: The idea that LLMs have the potential to be used as powerful general problem solvers, not just for generating well-written copies but also for solving complex tasks and achieving human-like intelligence. 4.

The following script iterates over the files in the LangChain repository and loads every `.py` file (a.k.a. **documents**): ```python # from git import Repo from langchain.document_loaders.generic import GenericLoader from langchain.document_loaders.parsers import LanguageParser from langchain.text_splitter import Language ``` ```python # Clone repo_path = ""/Users/rlm/Desktop/test_repo"" # repo = Repo.clone_from("" to_path=repo_path) ``` We load the py code using [LanguageParser]( which will: - Keep top-level functions and classes together (into a single document) - Put remaining code into a separate document - Retains metadata about where each split comes from ```python # Load loader = GenericLoader.from_filesystem( repo_path + ""/libs/langchain/langchain"", glob=""**/*"", suffixes=["".py""], parser=LanguageParser(language=Language.PYTHON, parser_threshold=500), ) documents = loader.load() len(documents) ``` ```text 1293 ``` ### Splitting Split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. We can use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` w/ `language` specified. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter python_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_language( language=Language.PYTHON, chunk_size=2000, chunk_overlap=200 ) texts = python_splitter.split_documents(documents) len(texts) ``` ```text 3748 ``` ### RetrievalQA We need to store the documents in a way we can semantically search for their content. The most common approach is to embed the contents of each document then store the embedding and document in a vector store. When setting up the vectorstore retriever: - We test [max marginal relevance](/docs/docs/use_cases/question_answering) for retrieval - And 8 documents returned #### Go deeper - Browse the > 40 vectorstores integrations [here]( - See further documentation on vectorstores [here](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/). - Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations [here]( - See further documentation on embedding models [here](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/). ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma db = Chroma.from_documents(texts, OpenAIEmbeddings(disallowed_special=())) retriever = db.as_retriever( search_type=""mmr"", # Also test ""similarity"" search_kwargs={""k"": 8}, ) ``` ### Chat Test chat, just as we do for [chatbots](/docs/docs/use_cases/chatbots). #### Go deeper - Browse the > 55 LLM and chat model integrations [here]( - See further documentation on LLMs and chat models [here](/docs/modules/model_io/models/). - Use local LLMS: The popularity of [PrivateGPT]( and [GPT4All]( underscore the importance of running LLMs locally. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-4"") memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python question = ""How can I initialize a ReAct agent?"" result = qa(question) result[""answer""] ``` ```text \'To initialize a ReAct agent, you need to follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Initialize a language model `llm` of type `BaseLanguageModel`.\\n\\n2. Initialize a document store `docstore` of type `Docstore`.\\n\\n3. Create a `DocstoreExplorer` with the initialized `docstore`. The `DocstoreExplorer` is used to search for and look up terms in the document store.\\n\\n4. Create an array of `Tool` objects. The `Tool` objects represent the actions that the agent can perform. In the case of `ReActDocstoreAgent`, the tools must be ""Search"" and ""Lookup"" with their corresponding functions from the `DocstoreExplorer`.\\n\\n5. Initialize the `ReActDocstoreAgent` using the `from_llm_and_tools` method with the `llm` (language model) and `tools` as parameters.\\n\\n6. Initialize the `ReActChain` (which is the `AgentExecutor`) using the `ReActDocstoreAgent` and `tools` as parameters.\\n\\nHere is an example of how to do this:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langchain.chains import ReActChain, OpenAI\\nfrom langchain.docstore.base import Docstore\\nfrom langchain.docstore.document import Document\\nfrom langchain.tools.base import BaseTool\\n\\n# Initialize the LLM and a docstore\\nllm = OpenAI()\\ndocstore = Docstore()\\n\\ndocstore_explorer = DocstoreExplorer(docstore)\\ntools = [\\n Tool(\\n name=""Search"",\\n func=docstore_explorer.search,\\n description=""Search for a term in the docstore."",\\n ),\\n Tool(\\n name=""Lookup"",\\n func=docstore_explorer.lookup,\\n description=""Lookup a term in the docstore."",\\n ),\\n]\\nagent = ReActDocstoreAgent.from_llm_and_tools(llm, tools)\\nreact = ReActChain(agent=agent, tools=tools)\\n```\\n\\nKeep in mind that this is a simplified example and you might need to adapt it to your specific needs.\' ``` ```python questions = [ ""What is the class hierarchy?"", ""What classes are derived from the Chain class?"", ""What one improvement do you propose in code in relation to the class hierarchy for the Chain class?"", ] for question in questions: result = qa(question) print(f""-> **Question**: {question} \\n"") print(f""**Answer**: {result[\'answer\']} \\n"") ``` ```text -> **Question**: What is the class hierarchy? **Answer**: The class hierarchy in object-oriented programming is the structure that forms when classes are derived from other classes. The derived class is a subclass of the base class also known as the superclass. This hierarchy is formed based on the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming where a subclass inherits the properties and functionalities of the superclass. In the given context, we have the following examples of class hierarchies: 1. `BaseCallbackHandler --> CallbackHandler` means `BaseCallbackHandler` is a base class and `CallbackHandler` (like `AimCallbackHandler`, `ArgillaCallbackHandler` etc.) are derived classes that inherit from `BaseCallbackHandler`. 2. `BaseLoader --> Loader` means `BaseLoader` is a base class and `Loader` (like `TextLoader`, `UnstructuredFileLoader` etc.) are derived classes that inherit from `BaseLoader`. 3. `ToolMetaclass --> BaseTool --> Tool` means `ToolMetaclass` is a base class, `BaseTool` is a derived class that inherits from `ToolMetaclass`, and `Tool` (like `AIPluginTool`, `BaseGraphQLTool` etc.) are further derived classes that inherit from `BaseTool`. -> **Question**: What classes are derived from the Chain class? **Answer**: The classes that are derived from the Chain class are: 1. LLMSummarizationCheckerChain 2. MapReduceChain 3. OpenAIModerationChain 4. NatBotChain 5. QAGenerationChain 6. QAWithSourcesChain 7. RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain 8. VectorDBQAWithSourcesChain 9. RetrievalQA 10. VectorDBQA 11. LLMRouterChain 12. MultiPromptChain 13. MultiRetrievalQAChain 14. MultiRouteChain 15. RouterChain 16. SequentialChain 17. SimpleSequentialChain 18. TransformChain 19. BaseConversationalRetrievalChain 20. ConstitutionalChain -> **Question**: What one improvement do you propose in code in relation to the class hierarchy for the Chain class? **Answer**: As an AI model, I don\'t have personal opinions. However, one suggestion could be to improve the documentation of the Chain class hierarchy. The current comments and docstrings provide some details but it could be helpful to include more explicit explanations about the hierarchy, roles of each subclass, and their relationships with one another. Also, incorporating UML diagrams or other visuals could help developers better understand the structure and interactions of the classes. ``` The can look at the [LangSmith trace]( to see what is happening under the hood: - In particular, the code well structured and kept together in the retrieval output - The retrieved code and chat history are passed to the LLM for answer distillation

To run LLaMA 2 in LangChain, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install langchainhub llama-cpp-python
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Ensure you have the correct environment variables for LLaMA 2:
   ```bash
   export LLAMA_MODEL_PATH=""/path/to/your/model/file""
   ```

3. **Initialize LLaMA 2 Model**:
   Use the `LlamaCpp` class to initialize the model:
   ```python
   from langchain.callbacks.manager import CallbackManager
   from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler
   from langchain.llms import LlamaCpp

   callback_manager = CallbackManager([StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()])
   llm = LlamaCpp(

       n_batch=512,
       f16_kv=True,
       callback_manager=callback_manager,
       verbose=True,
   )
   ```

4. **Use LLaMA 2 in Chains**:
   You can now use the initialized `llm` object in various LangChain chains:
   ```python
   from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain

   retriever = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type(llm)

We\'ll go over: 1. How to use functions to get structured outputs from ChatOpenAI 2. How to create a generic chain that uses (multiple) functions 3. How to create a chain that actually executes the chosen function ```python from typing import Optional from langchain.chains.openai_functions import ( create_openai_fn_chain, create_openai_fn_runnable, create_structured_output_chain, create_structured_output_runnable, ) from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate ``` ## Getting structured outputs We can take advantage of OpenAI functions to try and force the model to return a particular kind of structured output. We\'ll use `create_structured_output_runnable` to create our chain, which takes the desired structured output either as a Pydantic class or as JsonSchema. ### Using Pydantic classes When passing in Pydantic classes to structure our text, we need to make sure to have a docstring description for the class. It also helps to have descriptions for each of the classes attributes. ```python from langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field class Person(BaseModel): """"""Identifying information about a person."""""" name: str = Field(..., description=""The person\'s name"") age: int = Field(..., description=""The person\'s age"") fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=""The person\'s favorite food"") ``` ```python # If we pass in a model explicitly, we need to make sure it supports the OpenAI function-calling API. llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"", temperature=0) prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are a world class algorithm for extracting information in structured formats."", ), ( ""human"", ""Use the given format to extract information from the following input: {input}"", ), (""human"", ""Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format""), ] ) runnable = create_structured_output_runnable(Person, llm, prompt) runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Sally is 13""}) ``` ```text Person(name=\'Sally\', age=13, fav_food=\'Unknown\') ``` To extract arbitrarily many structured outputs of a given format, we can just create a wrapper Pydantic class that takes a sequence of the original class. ```python from typing import Sequence class People(BaseModel): """"""Identifying information about all people in a text."""""" people: Sequence[Person] = Field(..., description=""The people in the text"") runnable = create_structured_output_runnable(People, llm, prompt) runnable.invoke( { ""input"": ""Sally is 13, Joey just turned 12 and loves spinach. Caroline is 10 years older than Sally."" } ) ``` ```text People(people=[Person(name=\'Sally\', age=13, fav_food=\'\'), Person(name=\'Joey\', age=12, fav_food=\'spinach\'), Person(name=\'Caroline\', age=23, fav_food=\'\')]) ``` ### Using JsonSchema We can also pass in JsonSchema instead of Pydantic classes to specify the desired structure. When we do this, our chain will output JSON corresponding to the properties described in the JsonSchema, instead of a Pydantic class. ```python json_schema = { ""title"": ""Person"", ""description"": ""Identifying information about a person."", ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""name"": {""title"": ""Name"", ""description"": ""The person\'s name"", ""type"": ""string""}, ""age"": {""title"": ""Age"", ""description"": ""The person\'s age"", ""type"": ""integer""}, ""fav_food"": { ""title"": ""Fav Food"", ""description"": ""The person\'s favorite food"", ""type"": ""string"", }, }, ""required"": [""name"", ""age""], } ``` ```python runnable = create_structured_output_runnable(json_schema, llm, prompt) runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Sally is 13""}) ``` ```text {\'name\': \'Sally\', \'age\': 13} ``` ### [Legacy] LLMChain-based approach ```python chain = create_structured_output_chain(Person, llm, prompt, verbose=True) chain.run(""Sally is 13"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: System: You are a world class algorithm for extracting information in structured formats. Human: Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Sally is 13 Human: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format > Finished chain. Person(name=\'Sally\', age=13, fav_food=\'Unknown\') ``` ## Creating a generic OpenAI functions chain To create a generic OpenAI functions chain, we can use the `create_openai_fn_runnable` method. This is the same as `create_structured_output_runnable` except that instead of taking a single output schema, it takes a sequence of function definitions. Functions can be passed in as: - dicts conforming to OpenAI functions spec, - Pydantic classes, in which case they should have docstring descriptions of the function they represent and descriptions for each of the parameters, - Python functions, in which case they should have docstring descriptions of the function and args, along with type hints. ### Using Pydantic classes ```python class RecordPerson(BaseModel): """"""Record some identifying information about a pe."""""" name: str = Field(..., description=""The person\'s name"") age: int = Field(..., description=""The person\'s age"") fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=""The person\'s favorite food"") class RecordDog(BaseModel): """"""Record some identifying information about a dog."""""" name: str = Field(..., description=""The dog\'s name"") color: str = Field(..., description=""The dog\'s color"") fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=""The dog\'s favorite food"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains.openai_functions import ( convert_to_openai_function, get_openai_output_parser, ) prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a world class algorithm for recording entities.""), ( ""human"", ""Make calls to the relevant function to record the entities in the following input: {input}"", ), (""human"", ""Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format""), ] ) openai_functions = [convert_to_openai_function(f) for f in (RecordPerson, RecordDog)] llm_kwargs = {""functions"": openai_functions} if len(openai_functions) == 1: llm_kwargs[""function_call""] = {""name"": openai_functions[0][""name""]} output_parser = get_openai_output_parser((RecordPerson, RecordDog)) runnable = prompt | llm.bind(**llm_kwargs) | output_parser ``` ```python runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Harry was a chubby brown beagle who loved chicken""}) ``` ```text RecordDog(name=\'Harry\', color=\'brown\', fav_food=\'chicken\') ``` For convenience we can use the `create_openai_fn_runnable` method to help build our Runnable ```python runnable = create_openai_fn_runnable([RecordPerson, RecordDog], llm, prompt) runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Harry was a chubby brown beagle who loved chicken""}) ``` ```text RecordDog(name=\'Harry\', color=\'brown\', fav_food=\'chicken\') ``` ### Using Python functions We can pass in functions as Pydantic classes, directly as OpenAI function dicts, or Python functions. To pass Python function in directly, we\'ll want to make sure our parameters have type hints, we have a docstring, and we use [Google Python style docstrings]( to describe the parameters. **NOTE**: To use Python functions, make sure the function arguments are of primitive types (str, float, int, bool) or that they are Pydantic objects. ```python class OptionalFavFood(BaseModel): """"""Either a food or null."""""" food: Optional[str] = Field( None, description=""Either the name of a food or null. Should be null if the food isn\'t known."", ) def record_person(name: str, age: int, fav_food: OptionalFavFood) -> str: """"""Record some basic identifying information about a person.

To convert existing GGML models to GGUF you can run the following in [llama.cpp]( ```text python ./convert-llama-ggmlv3-to-gguf.py --eps 1e-5 --input models/openorca-platypus2-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin --output models/openorca-platypus2-13b.gguf.q4_0.bin ``` ## Installation There are different options on how to install the llama-cpp package: - CPU usage - CPU + GPU (using one of many BLAS backends) - Metal GPU (MacOS with Apple Silicon Chip) ### CPU only installation ```bash pip install llama-cpp-python ``` ### Installation with OpenBLAS / cuBLAS / CLBlast `llama.cpp` supports multiple BLAS backends for faster processing. Use the `FORCE_CMAKE=1` environment variable to force the use of cmake and install the pip package for the desired BLAS backend ([source]( Example installation with cuBLAS backend: ```bash CMAKE_ARGS=""-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on"" FORCE_CMAKE=1 pip install llama-cpp-python ``` **IMPORTANT**: If you have already installed the CPU only version of the package, you need to reinstall it from scratch. Consider the following command: ```bash CMAKE_ARGS=""-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on"" FORCE_CMAKE=1 pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall llama-cpp-python --no-cache-dir ``` ### Installation with Metal `llama.cpp` supports Apple silicon first-class citizen - optimized via ARM NEON, Accelerate and Metal frameworks. Use the `FORCE_CMAKE=1` environment variable to force the use of cmake and install the pip package for the Metal support ([source]( Example installation with Metal Support: ```bash CMAKE_ARGS=""-DLLAMA_METAL=on"" FORCE_CMAKE=1 pip install llama-cpp-python ``` **IMPORTANT**: If you have already installed a cpu only version of the package, you need to reinstall it from scratch: consider the following command: ```bash CMAKE_ARGS=""-DLLAMA_METAL=on"" FORCE_CMAKE=1 pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall llama-cpp-python --no-cache-dir ``` ### Installation with Windows It is stable to install the `llama-cpp-python` library by compiling from the source. You can follow most of the instructions in the repository itself but there are some windows specific instructions which might be useful. Requirements to install the `llama-cpp-python`, - git - python - cmake - Visual Studio Community (make sure you install this with the following settings)- Desktop development with C++ - Python development - Linux embedded development with C++ 1. Clone git repository recursively to get `llama.cpp` submodule as well ```text git clone --recursive -j8 ``` 1. Open up command Prompt (or anaconda prompt if you have it installed), set up environment variables to install. Follow this if you do not have a GPU, you must set both of the following variables. ```text set FORCE_CMAKE=1 set CMAKE_ARGS=-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=OFF ``` You can ignore the second environment variable if you have an NVIDIA GPU. #### Compiling and installing In the same command prompt (anaconda prompt) you set the variables, you can `cd` into `llama-cpp-python` directory and run the following commands. ```text python setup.py clean python setup.py install ``` ## Usage Make sure you are following all instructions to [install all necessary model files]( You don\'t need an `API_TOKEN` as you will run the LLM locally. It is worth understanding which models are suitable to be used on the desired machine. [TheBloke\'s]( Hugging Face models have a `Provided files` section that exposes the RAM required to run models of different quantisation sizes and methods (eg: [Llama2-7B-Chat-GGUF]( This [github issue]( is also relevant to find the right model for your machine. ```python from langchain.callbacks.manager import CallbackManager from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import LlamaCpp from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` **Consider using a template that suits your model!

Two of the most important parameters for use with GPU are: - `n_gpu_layers` - determines how many layers of the model are offloaded to your GPU. - `n_batch` - how many tokens are processed in parallel. Setting these parameters correctly will dramatically improve the evaluation speed (see [wrapper code]( for more details). ```python n_gpu_layers = 40 # Change this value based on your model and your GPU VRAM pool. n_batch = 512 # Should be between 1 and n_ctx, consider the amount of VRAM in your GPU. # Make sure the model path is correct for your system! llm = LlamaCpp( model_path=""/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/llama.cpp/models/openorca-platypus2-13b.gguf.q4_0.bin"", n_gpu_layers=n_gpu_layers, n_batch=n_batch, callback_manager=callback_manager, verbose=True, # Verbose is required to pass to the callback manager ) ``` ```python llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm) question = ""What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Bieber was born?"" llm_chain.run(question) ``` ```text 1.

Find the Super Bowl winner of that year: The NFL season of 1993 with the Super Bowl being played in January or of 1994. 3. Determine which team won the game: The Dallas Cowboys faced the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVII on January 31, 1993 (as the year is mis-labelled due to a error). The Dallas Cowboys won this matchup. So, Justin Bieber was born when the Dallas Cowboys were the reigning NFL Super Bowl. llama_print_timings: load time = 427.63 ms llama_print_timings: sample time = 115.85 ms / 164 runs ( 0.71 ms per token, 1415.67 tokens per second) llama_print_timings: prompt eval time = 427.53 ms / 45 tokens ( 9.50 ms per token, 105.26 tokens per second) llama_print_timings: eval time = 4526.53 ms / 163 runs ( 27.77 ms per token, 36.01 tokens per second) llama_print_timings: total time = 5293.77 ms ""\\n\\n1.

Two of the most important GPU parameters are: - `n_gpu_layers` - determines how many layers of the model are offloaded to your Metal GPU, in the most case, set it to `1` is enough for Metal - `n_batch` - how many tokens are processed in parallel, default is 8, set to bigger number. - `f16_kv` - for some reason, Metal only support `True`, otherwise you will get error such as `Asserting on type 0 GGML_ASSERT: .../ggml-metal.m:706: false && ""not implemented""` Setting these parameters correctly will dramatically improve the evaluation speed (see [wrapper code]( for more details). ```python n_gpu_layers = 1 # Metal set to 1 is enough. n_batch = 512 # Should be between 1 and n_ctx, consider the amount of RAM of your Apple Silicon Chip. # Make sure the model path is correct for your system! llm = LlamaCpp( model_path=""/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/llama.cpp/models/openorca-platypus2-13b.gguf.q4_0.bin"", n_gpu_layers=n_gpu_layers, n_batch=n_batch, f16_kv=True, # MUST set to True, otherwise you will run into problem after a couple of calls callback_manager=callback_manager, verbose=True, # Verbose is required to pass to the callback manager ) ``` The console log will show the following log to indicate Metal was enable properly. ```text ggml_metal_init: allocating ggml_metal_init: using MPS ... ``` You also could check `Activity Monitor` by watching the GPU usage of the process, the CPU usage will drop dramatically after turn on `n_gpu_layers=1`. For the first call to the LLM, the performance may be slow due to the model compilation in Metal GPU. ### Grammars We can use [grammars]( to constrain model outputs and sample tokens based on the rules defined in them. To demonstrate this concept, we\'ve included [sample grammar files]( that will be used in the examples below. Creating gbnf grammar files can be time-consuming, but if you have a use-case where output schemas are important, there are two tools that can help: - [Online grammar generator app]( that converts TypeScript interface definitions to gbnf file. - [Python script]( for converting json schema to gbnf file. You can for example create `pydantic` object, generate its JSON schema using `.schema_json()` method, and then use this script to convert it to gbnf file. In the first example, supply the path to the specifed `json.gbnf` file in order to produce JSON: ```python n_gpu_layers = 1 # Metal set to 1 is enough. n_batch = 512 # Should be between 1 and n_ctx, consider the amount of RAM of your Apple Silicon Chip. # Make sure the model path is correct for your system! llm = LlamaCpp( model_path=""/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/llama.cpp/models/openorca-platypus2-13b.gguf.q4_0.bin"", n_gpu_layers=n_gpu_layers, n_batch=n_batch, f16_kv=True, # MUST set to True, otherwise you will run into problem after a couple of calls callback_manager=callback_manager, verbose=True, # Verbose is required to pass to the callback manager grammar_path=""/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/langchain-main/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/llms/grammars/json.gbnf"", ) ``` ```python result = llm(""Describe a person in JSON format:"") ``` ```text { ""name"": ""John Doe"", ""age"": 34, """": { ""title"": ""Software Developer"", ""company"": ""Google"" }, ""interests"": [ ""Sports"", ""Music"", ""Cooking"" ], ""address"": { ""street_number"": 123, ""street_name"": ""Oak Street"", ""city"": ""Mountain View"", ""state"": ""California"", ""postal_code"": 94040 }} llama_print_timings: load time = 357.51 ms llama_print_timings: sample time = 1213.30 ms / 144 runs ( 8.43 ms per token, 118.68 tokens per second) llama_print_timings: prompt eval time = 356.78 ms / 9 tokens ( 39.64 ms per token, 25.23 tokens per second) llama_print_timings: eval time = 3947.16 ms / 143 runs ( 27.60 ms per token, 36.23 tokens per second) llama_print_timings: total time = 5846.21 ms ``` We can also supply `list.gbnf` to return a list: ```python n_gpu_layers = 1 n_batch = 512 llm = LlamaCpp( model_path=""/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/llama.cpp/models/openorca-platypus2-13b.gguf.q4_0.bin"", n_gpu_layers=n_gpu_layers, n_batch=n_batch, f16_kv=True, # MUST set to True, otherwise you will run into problem after a couple of calls callback_manager=callback_manager, verbose=True, grammar_path=""/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/langchain-main/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/llms/grammars/list.gbnf"", ) ``` ```python result = llm(""List of top-3 my favourite books:"") ``` ```text [""The Catcher in the Rye"", ""Wuthering Heights"", ""Anna Karenina""] llama_print_timings: load time = 322.34 ms llama_print_timings: sample time = 232.60 ms / 26 runs ( 8.95 ms per token, 111.78 tokens per second) llama_print_timings: prompt eval time = 321.90 ms / 11 tokens ( 29.26 ms per token, 34.17 tokens per second) llama_print_timings: eval time = 680.82 ms / 25 runs ( 27.23 ms per token, 36.72 tokens per second) llama_print_timings: total time = 1295.27 ms ``` - [Installation](#installation)- [CPU only installation](#cpu-only-installation) - [Installation with OpenBLAS / cuBLAS / CLBlast](#installation-with-openblas--cublas--clblast) - [Installation with Metal](#installation-with-metal) - [Installation with Windows](#installation-with-windows) - [Usage](#usage)- [CPU](#cpu) - [GPU](#gpu) - [Metal](#metal) - [Grammars](#grammars)', 'WebResearchRetriever | WebResearchRetriever Given a query, this retriever will: - Formulate a set of relate Google searches - Search for each - Load all the resulting URLs - Then embed and perform similarity search with the query on the consolidate page content ```python from langchain.retrievers.web_research import WebResearchRetriever ``` ### Simple usage Specify the LLM to use for Google search query generation. ```python import os from langchain.chat_models.openai import ChatOpenAI from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma # Vectorstore vectorstore = Chroma( embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddings(), persist_directory=""./chroma_db_oai"" ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) # Search os.environ[""GOOGLE_CSE_ID""] = ""xxx"" os.environ[""GOOGLE_API_KEY""] = ""xxx"" search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper() ``` ```python # Initialize web_research_retriever = WebResearchRetriever.from_llm( vectorstore=vectorstore, llm=llm, search=search, ) ``` #### Run with citations We can use `RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain` to retrieve docs and provide citations. ```python from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain user_input = ""How do LLM Powered Autonomous Agents work?"" qa_chain = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type( llm, retriever=web_research_retriever ) result = qa_chain({""question"": user_input}) result ``` ```text Fetching pages: 100%|###################################################################################################################################| 1/1 [00:00<00:00, 3.33it/s] {\'question\': \'How do LLM Powered Autonomous Agents work?\', \'answer\': ""LLM Powered Autonomous Agents work by using LLM (large language model) as the core controller of the agent\'s brain.

This has at least two important benefits: 1. `Privacy`: Your data is not sent to a third party, and it is not subject to the terms of service of a commercial service 2. `Cost`: There is no inference fee, which is important for token-intensive applications (e.g., [long-running simulations]( summarization) ## Overview Running an LLM locally requires a few things: 1. `Open-source LLM`: An open-source LLM that can be freely modified and shared 2. `Inference`: Ability to run this LLM on your device w/ acceptable latency ### Open-source LLMs Users can now gain access to a rapidly growing set of [open-source LLMs]( These LLMs can be assessed across at least two dimensions (see figure): 1. `Base model`: What is the base-model and how was it trained? 2. `Fine-tuning approach`: Was the base-model fine-tuned and, if so, what [set of instructions]( was used? ![Image description](/assets/images/OSS_LLM_overview-b0a96cc35216ec43c3ccde7ed1140854.png) The relative performance of these models can be assessed using several leaderboards, including: 1. [LmSys]( 2. [GPT4All]( 3. [HuggingFace]( ### Inference A few frameworks for this have emerged to support inference of open-source LLMs on various devices: 1. [llama.cpp]( C++ implementation of llama inference code with [weight optimization / quantization]( 2. [gpt4all]( Optimized C backend for inference 3. [Ollama]( Bundles model weights and environment into an app that runs on device and serves the LLM In general, these frameworks will do a few things: 1. `Quantization`: Reduce the memory footprint of the raw model weights 2. `Efficient implementation for inference`: Support inference on consumer hardware (e.g., CPU or laptop GPU) In particular, see [this excellent post]( on the importance of quantization. ![Image description](/assets/images/llama-memory-weights-aaccef5df087e993b0f46277500039b6.png) With less precision, we radically decrease the memory needed to store the LLM in memory. In addition, we can see the importance of GPU memory bandwidth [sheet]( A Mac M2 Max is 5-6x faster than a M1 for inference due to the larger GPU memory bandwidth. ![Image description](/assets/images/llama_t_put-c6f0ea201a6dd508999170325cd6804a.png) ## Quickstart [Ollama]( is one way to easily run inference on macOS. The instructions [here](/docs/guides/docs/integrations/llms/ollama) provide details, which we summarize: - [Download and run]( the app - From command line, fetch a model from this [list of options]( e.g., `ollama pull llama2` - When the app is running, all models are automatically served on `localhost:11434` ```python from langchain.llms import Ollama llm = Ollama(model=""llama2"") llm(""The first man on the moon was ..."") ``` ```text \' The first man on the moon was Neil Armstrong, who landed on the moon on July 20, 1969 as part of the Apollo 11 mission. obviously.\' ``` Stream tokens as they are being generated. ```python from langchain.callbacks.manager import CallbackManager from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler llm = Ollama( model=""llama2"", callback_manager=CallbackManager([StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()]) ) llm(""The first man on the moon was ..."") ``` ```text The first man to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong, an American astronaut who was part of the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. 20, 1969, Armstrong stepped out of the lunar module Eagle and onto the moon\'s surface, famously declaring ""That\'s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"" as he took his first steps. He was followed by fellow astronaut Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin, who also walked on the moon during the mission. \' The first man to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong, an American astronaut who was part of the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. 20, 1969, Armstrong stepped out of the lunar module Eagle and onto the moon\\\'s surface, famously declaring ""That\\\'s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"" as he took his first steps. He was followed by fellow astronaut Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin, who also walked on the moon during the mission.\' ``` ## Environment Inference speed is a challenge when running models locally (see above). To minimize latency, it is desirable to run models locally on GPU, which ships with many consumer laptops [e.g., Apple devices]( And even with GPU, the available GPU memory bandwidth (as noted above) is important. ### Running Apple silicon GPU `Ollama` will automatically utilize the GPU on Apple devices. Other frameworks require the user to set up the environment to utilize the Apple GPU. For example, `llama.cpp` python bindings can be configured to use the GPU via [Metal]( Metal is a graphics and compute API created by Apple providing near-direct access to the GPU. See the [llama.cpp](/docs/guides/docs/integrations/llms/llamacpp) setup [here]( to enable this. In particular, ensure that conda is using the correct virtual environment that you created (`miniforge3`). E.g., for me: ```text conda activate /Users/rlm/miniforge3/envs/llama ``` With the above confirmed, then: ```text CMAKE_ARGS=""-DLLAMA_METAL=on"" FORCE_CMAKE=1 pip install -U llama-cpp-python --no-cache-dir ``` ## LLMs There are various ways to gain access to quantized model weights. 1. [HuggingFace]( - Many quantized model are available for download and can be run with framework such as [llama.cpp]( 2. [gpt4all]( - The model explorer offers a leaderboard of metrics and associated quantized models available for download 3. [Ollama]( - Several models can be accessed directly via `pull` ### Ollama With [Ollama](/docs/guides/docs/integrations/llms/ollama), fetch a model via `ollama pull :`: - E.g., for Llama-7b: `ollama pull llama2` will download the most basic version of the model (e.g., smallest # parameters and 4 bit quantization) - We can also specify a particular version from the [model list]( e.g., `ollama pull llama2:13b` - See the full set of parameters on the [API reference page]( ```python from langchain.llms import Ollama llm = Ollama(model=""llama2:13b"") llm(""The first man on the moon was ... think step by step"") ``` ```text \' Sure!

From the [llama.cpp docs]( a few are worth commenting on: `n_gpu_layers`: number of layers to be loaded into GPU memory - Value: 1 - Meaning: Only one layer of the model will be loaded into GPU memory (1 is often sufficient). `n_batch`: number of tokens the model should process in parallel - Value: n_batch - Meaning: It\'s recommended to choose a value between 1 and n_ctx (which in this case is set to 2048) `n_ctx`: Token context window . - Value: 2048 - Meaning: The model will consider a window of 2048 tokens at a time `f16_kv`: whether the model should use half-precision for the key/value cache - Value: True - Meaning: The model will use half-precision, which can be more memory efficient; Metal only supports True. ```python %pip install -U llama-cpp-python --no-cache-dirclear` ``` ```python from langchain.llms import LlamaCpp llm = LlamaCpp( model_path=""/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/llama.cpp/models/openorca-platypus2-13b.gguf.q4_0.bin"", n_gpu_layers=1, n_batch=512, n_ctx=2048, f16_kv=True, callback_manager=CallbackManager([StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()]), verbose=True, ) ``` The console log will show the below to indicate Metal was enabled properly from steps above: ```text ggml_metal_init: allocating ggml_metal_init: using MPS ``` ```python llm(""The first man on the moon was ...

Similar to what is shown above, we can run inference and use [the API reference]( to set parameters of interest. ```python pip install gpt4all ``` ```python from langchain.llms import GPT4All llm = GPT4All( model=""/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/gpt4all/models/nous-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin"" ) ``` ```python llm(""The first man on the moon was ...

This will work with your [LangSmith API key]( For example, [here]( is a prompt for RAG with LLaMA-specific tokens. ## Use cases Given an `llm` created from one of the models above, you can use it for [many use cases](/docs/guides/docs/use_cases). For example, here is a guide to [RAG](/docs/guides/docs/use_cases/question_answering/local_retrieval_qa) with local LLMs. In general, use cases for local LLMs can be driven by at least two factors: - `Privacy`: private data (e.g., journals, etc) that a user does not want to share - `Cost`: text preprocessing (extraction/tagging), summarization, and agent simulations are token-use-intensive tasks In addition, [here]( is an overview on fine-tuning, which can utilize open-source LLMs. - [Use case](#use-case) - [Overview](#overview)- [Open-source LLMs](#open-source-llms) - [Inference](#inference) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Environment](#environment)- [Running Apple silicon GPU](#running-apple-silicon-gpu) - [LLMs](#llms)- [Ollama](#ollama) - [Llama.cpp](#llamacpp) - [GPT4All](#gpt4all) - [Prompts](#prompts) - [Use cases](#use-cases)']","To run the `llama` model using the `vllm` framework, you'll need to follow these general steps:

1. **Install `vllm`**: First, ensure you have `vllm` installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install vllm
   ```

2. **Download the Llama Model**: You need to have the `llama` model files. If you haven't already downloaded them, you can find them on the [Hugging Face model hub](https://huggingface.co/models) or another source where the model is hosted.

3. **Prepare the Configuration File**: `vllm` typically requires a configuration file to specify the model details. Here's an example configuration file (`config.yaml`):

   ```yaml
   model:
     name: ""path/to/your/llama-model""
     device: ""cuda"" # or ""cpu"" depending on your setup
   ```

4. **Run the Model with `vllm`**: Use the `vllm` command to run the model with the configuration file you prepared:

   ```bash
   vllm run -c config.yaml
   ```

5. **Interact with the Model**: Once the model is running, you can interact with it through the provided interface, usually via a command-line interface or an API endpoint, depending on how `vllm` is set up.

Please note that the exact steps might vary slightly depending on the version of `vllm` and the specific requirements of the `llama` model you are using. Always refer to the official documentation of both `vllm` and the `llama` model for the most accurate and detailed instructions.

If you encounter any issues, consider checking the official GitHub repositories or forums for `vllm` and `llama` for additional support.","You can run HuggingFace models in vLLM, so you can select the model name of a compatible Llama model then use the VLLM class in LangChain:
 ```python
from langchain.llms import VLLM

llm = VLLM(
    model=""name-of-llama-model"",
    trust_remote_code=True,  # mandatory for hf models
)

print(llm(""What is the capital of France ?""))

90,What class type is returned by initialize_agent,"['Multi-Input Tools | Multi-Input Tools This notebook shows how to use a tool that requires multiple inputs with an agent. The recommended way to do so is with the `StructuredTool` class. ```python import os os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING""] = ""true"" ``` ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.llms import OpenAI llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python from langchain.tools import StructuredTool def multiplier(a: float, b: float) -> float: """"""Multiply the provided floats."""""" return a * b tool = StructuredTool.from_function(multiplier) ``` ```python # Structured tools are compatible with the STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION agent type. agent_executor = initialize_agent( [tool], llm, agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python agent_executor.run(""What is 3 times 4"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

The tool would then have to handle the parsing logic to extract the relevant values from the text, which tightly couples the tool representation to the agent prompt. This is still useful if the underlying language model can\'t reliably generate structured schema. Let\'s take the multiplication function as an example. In order to use this, we will tell the agent to generate the ""Action Input"" as a comma-separated list of length two. We will then write a thin wrapper that takes a string, splits it into two around a comma, and passes both parsed sides as integers to the multiplication function. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` Here is the multiplication function, as well as a wrapper to parse a string as input. ```python def multiplier(a, b): return a * b def parsing_multiplier(string): a, b = string.split("","") return multiplier(int(a), int(b)) ``` ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) tools = [ Tool( name=""Multiplier"", func=parsing_multiplier, description=""useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together.

It provides comprehensive features for monitoring, managing models, and improving the performance of your AI applications. ## LLMOps for Langchain Portkey brings production readiness to Langchain. With Portkey, you can - view detailed **metrics & logs** for all requests, - enable **semantic cache** to reduce latency & costs, - implement automatic **retries & fallbacks** for failed requests, - add **custom tags** to requests for better tracking and analysis and [more]( ### Using Portkey with Langchain Using Portkey is as simple as just choosing which Portkey features you want, enabling them via `headers=Portkey.Config` and passing it in your LLM calls. To start, get your Portkey API key by [signing up here]( (Click the profile icon on the top left, then click on ""Copy API Key"") For OpenAI, a simple integration with logging feature would look like this: ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import Portkey # Add the Portkey API Key from your account headers = Portkey.Config( api_key = """" ) llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, headers=headers) llm.predict(""What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"") ``` Your logs will be captured on your [Portkey dashboard]( A common Portkey X Langchain use case is to **trace a chain or an agent** and view all the LLM calls originating from that request. ### Tracing Chains & Agents ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import Portkey # Add the Portkey API Key from your account headers = Portkey.Config( api_key = """", trace_id = ""fef659"" ) llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, headers=headers) tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm) agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True) # Let\'s test it out! agent.run(""What was the high temperature in SF yesterday in Fahrenheit? What is that number raised to the .023 power?"") ``` **You can see the requests\' logs along with the trace id on Portkey dashboard:** ![](/img/portkey-dashboard.gif)![](/img/portkey-tracing.png)## Advanced Features 1. **Logging:** Log all your LLM requests automatically by sending them through Portkey. Each request log contains `timestamp`, `model name`, `total cost`, `request time`, `request json`, `response json`, and additional Portkey features. 2. **Tracing:** Trace id can be passed along with each request and is visibe on the logs on Portkey dashboard. You can also set a **distinct trace id** for each request. You can [append user feedback]( to a trace id as well. 3. **Caching:** Respond to previously served customers queries from cache instead of sending them again to OpenAI. Match exact strings OR semantically similar strings. Cache can save costs and reduce latencies by 20x. 4. **Retries:** Automatically reprocess any unsuccessful API requests **upto 5** times. Uses an **exponential backoff** strategy, which spaces out retry attempts to prevent network overload. 5. **Tagging:** Track and audit each user interaction in high detail with predefined tags. | Feature | Config Key | Value (Type) | Required/Optional | | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | | API Key | api_key | API Key (string) | Required | | Tracing Requests | trace_id | Customstring | Optional | | Automatic Retries | retry_count | integer[1,2,3,4,5] | Optional | | Enabling Cache | cache | simpleORsemantic | Optional | | Cache Force Refresh | cache_force_refresh | True | Optional | | Set Cache Expiry | cache_age | integer(in seconds) | Optional | | Add User | user | string | Optional | | Add Organisation | organisation | string | Optional | | Add Environment | environment | string | Optional | | Add Prompt (version/id/string) | prompt | string | Optional | ## Enabling all Portkey Features: ```py headers = Portkey.Config( # Mandatory api_key="""", # Cache Options cache=""semantic"", cache_force_refresh=""True"", cache_age=1729, # Advanced retry_count=5, trace_id=""langchain_agent"", # Metadata environment=""production"", user=""john"", organisation=""acme"", prompt=""Frost"" ) ``` For detailed information on each feature and how to use it, [please refer to the Portkey docs]( If you have any questions or need further assistance, [reach out to us on Twitter.]( - [LLMOps for Langchain](#llmops-for-langchain)- [Using Portkey with Langchain](#using-portkey-with-langchain) - [Tracing Chains & Agents](#tracing-chains--agents) - [Advanced Features](#advanced-features) - [Enabling all Portkey Features:](#enabling-all-portkey-features)']",The `initialize_agent` function returns an instance of the `AgentExecutor` class.,AgentExecutor,0.9999999999666667,1.0,0.5,0.022869567780619007,0.16666666666666669
