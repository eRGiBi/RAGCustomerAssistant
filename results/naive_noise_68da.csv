1,How do I use LangChain with multiple LLMs?,"['## Customizing Qdrant\u200b\n\nThere are some options to use an existing Qdrant collection within your Langchain application. In such cases you may need to define how to map Qdrant point into the Langchain `Document`.\n\n### Named vectors\u200b\n\nQdrant supports [multiple vectors per point](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/collections/#collection-with-multiple-vectors) by named vectors. Langchain requires just a single embedding per document and, by default, uses a single vector. However, if you work with a collection created externally or want to have the named vector used, you can configure it by providing its name.\n\n```python\nQdrant.from_documents(\n    docs,\n    embeddings,\n    location="":memory:"",\n    collection_name=""my_documents_2"",\n    vector_name=""custom_vector"",\n)\n```\n\nAs a Langchain user, you won\'t see any difference whether you use named vectors or not. Qdrant integration will handle the conversion under the hood.\n\n### Metadata\u200b', 'vector_schema = {\n    ""algorithm"": ""HNSW""\n}\n\nrds = Redis.from_texts(\n    texts, # a list of strings\n    metadata, # a list of metadata dicts\n    embeddings, # an Embeddings object\n    vector_schema=vector_schema,\n    redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"",\n)\n\nCustom index schema can be supplied to change the way that the\nmetadata is indexed. This is useful for you would like to use the\nhybrid querying (filtering) capability of Redis.\nBy default, this implementation will automatically generate the index\nschema according to the following rules:\n\nAll strings are indexed as text fields\nAll numbers are indexed as numeric fields\n\nAll lists of strings are indexed as tag fields (joined bylangchain.vectorstores.redis.constants.REDIS_TAG_SEPARATOR)\n\nAll None values are not indexed but still stored in Redis these arenot retrievable through the interface here, but the raw Redis client\ncan be used to retrieve them.\n\nAll other types are not indexed', 'query = ""Warren Buffett""\nraw_documents = WikipediaLoader(query=query).load()\ngraph_documents = diffbot_nlp.convert_to_graph_documents(raw_documents)\n```\n\n## Loading the data into a knowledge graph\u200b\n\nYou will need to have a running Neo4j instance.

First, let's go over loading an LLM configuration from disk. LLM configurations can be saved in two formats: JSON or YAML, but they are loaded in the same way.

For a JSON-formatted LLM configuration (llm.json):

```json
{
    ""model_name"": ""text-davinci-003"",
    ""temperature"": 0.7,
    ""max_tokens"": 256,
    ""top_p"": 1.0,
    ""frequency_penalty"": 0.0,
    ""presence_penalty"": 0.0,
    ""n"": 1,
    ""best_of"": 1,
    ""request_timeout"": null,
    ""_type"": ""openai""
}
```

Load the configuration like this:

```python
from langchain.llms.loading import load_llm

llm = load_llm(""llm.json"")
```

For a YAML-formatted LLM configuration (llm.yaml):

```yaml
_type: openai
best_of: 1
frequency_penalty: 0.0
max_tokens: 256
model_name: text-davinci-003
n: 1
presence_penalty: 0.0
request_timeout: null
temperature: 0.7
top_p: 1.0
```

Load the configuration like this:

```python
from langchain.llms.loading import load_llm

llm = load_llm(""llm.yaml"")
```

To save an LLM configuration from memory to a serialized version, you can use the `.save` method. This method supports both JSON and YAML formats:

```python
llm.save(""llm.json"")
llm.save(""llm.yaml"")
```

This way, you can easily save and load LLM configurations to and from disk.",0.99999999995,,0.0,0.0006528036073093087,0.0

    pip install qdrant-client

Next, import the necessary classes and functions:

    from langchain.llms import OpenAI
    from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

Load, split, and embed your documents:

    text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0, separator=""

Next, connect to Qdrant. This is for storing locally on-disk, but you can also use an on-premise server deployment or store on the Qdrant cloud:

    qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents(
        documents,
        embeddings,
        path=""/tmp/local_qdrant"",

Next, create a memory object, which is necessary to track the inputs/outputs and hold a conversation:

    memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True)

Now initialize the ConversationalRetrievalChain:

    qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), qdrant.as_retriever(), memory=memory)

Now, you can create queries to test it out:

2. **Error Handling**: Implement try-except blocks to catch and handle these exceptions gracefully.
3. **Debugging**: Add logging to understand what might be causing the exception.

If you provide more details about the context or the framework you are using, I might be able to offer more specific advice.","You can control the agent's behavior for output parsing errors by initializing the agent with `handle_parsing_errors`=True.

Originally, the vice president was the person who received the second-most votes for president in the Electoral College. But after the election of 1800 produced a tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, requiring the House of Representatives to choose between them, lawmakers acted to prevent such a situation from recurring. The Twelfth Amendment was added to the Constitution in 1804, creating the current system where electors cast a separate ballot for the vice presidency.The vice president is the first person in the presidential line of succession—that is, they assume the presidency if the president dies, resigns, or is impeached and removed from office. Nine vice presidents have ascended to the presidency in this way: eight (John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester A. Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry S. Truman, and Lyndon B. Johnson) through', '\'imageUrl\': \'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQJhXTQQtjSUZf9YPM235WQhFU5_d7lEA76zB8DGwZfixcgf1_dhPJyKA1Nbw&s\',\n               \'position\': 2},\n              {\'title\': \'""I think people can get by with $999 million,"" Bernie \'\n                        \'Sanders tells American Billionaires.\',\n               \'link\': \'https://thebharatexpressnews.com/i-think-people-can-get-by-with-999-million-bernie-sanders-tells-american-billionaires-heres-how-the-ultra-rich-can-pay-less-income-tax-than-you-legally/\',\n               \'snippet\': \'The report noted that in 2007 and 2011, Amazon.com Inc. \'\n                          \'founder Jeff Bezos “did not pay a dime in federal ... \'\n                          \'If you want to bet on Musk, check out Tesla.\',\n               \'date\': \'11 mins ago\',\n               \'source\': \'THE BHARAT EXPRESS NEWS\',', 'Microsoft SharePoint | 🦜️🔗 Langchain\n\n[Skip to main content](#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)# Microsoft SharePoint\n\n[Microsoft SharePoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SharePoint) is a website-based collaboration system that uses workflow applications, “list” databases, and other web parts and security features to empower business teams to work together developed by Microsoft.\n\nThis notebook covers how to load documents from the [SharePoint Document Library](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-is-a-document-library-3b5976dd-65cf-4c9e-bf5a-713c10ca2872).

- Document loaders: LangChain offers over 100 document loaders to load documents from different sources, including private S3 buckets and public websites.
- Document transformers: These help in fetching relevant parts of documents by splitting or chunking large documents into smaller chunks.
- Text embedding models: LangChain integrates with over 25 different embedding providers and methods to create embeddings for documents, allowing efficient similarity-based retrieval.
- Vector stores: With the rise of embeddings, LangChain supports over 50 vector stores for efficient storage and searching of embeddings.
- Retrievers: LangChain supports various retrieval algorithms, including semantic search, parent document retriever, self-query retriever, ensemble retriever, and more, to retrieve the data from the database.

- Seamless LangSmith Tracing Integration: LCEL logs all steps to LangSmith for observability and debuggability. [0]

```python

    print(f""Prompt for model call: {prompt}"")

model_call_1 = (

In this example, `print_prompt` is a function that prints the prompt. It's added to the pipeline after `model_parser` to capture and print the prompt before it's passed to the next model call.
