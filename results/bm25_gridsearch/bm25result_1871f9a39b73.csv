0,What are the benefits of using LangChain for building chatbots?,"[""Introduction | Introduction **LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that: - **Are context-aware**: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.) - **Reason**: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.) This framework consists of several parts. - **LangChain Libraries**: The Python and JavaScript libraries. Contains interfaces and integrations for a myriad of components, a basic run time for combining these components into chains and agents, and off-the-shelf implementations of chains and agents. - **LangChain Templates**: A collection of easily deployable reference architectures for a wide variety of tasks. - **LangServe**: A library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API. - **LangSmith**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain. ![LangChain Diagram](/assets/images/langchain_stack-7bb980051b626aad30ec43647b717411.png) Together, these products simplify the entire application lifecycle: - **Develop**: Write your applications in LangChain/LangChain.js. Hit the ground running using Templates for reference. - **Productionize**: Use LangSmith to inspect, test and monitor your chains, so that you can constantly improve and deploy with confidence. - **Deploy**: Turn any chain into an API with LangServe. ## LangChain Libraries The main value props of the LangChain packages are: 1. **Components**: composable tools and integrations for working with language models. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not 2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: built-in assemblages of components for accomplishing higher-level tasks Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. Components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones. ## Get started [Here's](/docs/get_started/installation) how to install LangChain, set up your environment, and start building. We recommend following our [Quickstart](/docs/get_started/quickstart) guide to familiarize yourself with the framework by building your first LangChain application. Read up on our [Security](/docs/security) best practices to make sure you're developing safely with LangChain. noteThese docs focus on the Python LangChain library. [Head here]( for docs on the JavaScript LangChain library. ## LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) LCEL is a declarative way to compose chains. LCEL was designed from day 1 to support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest prompt + LLM chain to the most complex chains. - **Overview**: LCEL and its benefits - **Interface**: The standard interface for LCEL objects - **How-to**: Key features of LCEL - **Cookbook**: Example code for accomplishing common tasks ## Modules LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and integrations for the following modules: #### Model I/O Interface with language models #### Retrieval Interface with application-specific data #### Agents Let models choose which tools to use given high-level directives ## Examples, ecosystem, and resources ### Use cases Walkthroughs and techniques for common end-to-end use cases, like: - [Document question answering](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/) - [Chatbots](/docs/use_cases/chatbots/) - [Analyzing structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql/) - and much more... ### Integrations LangChain is part of a rich ecosystem of tools that integrate with our framework and build on top of it.

The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1. Simple prompting: Agents can use Language Model based prompting to break down tasks into subgoals. For example, by providing prompts like ""Steps for XYZ"" or ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", the agent can generate a sequence of smaller steps that lead to the completion of the overall task.\\n\\n2. Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to ""Write a story outline."" This provides a high-level structure for the task and helps in breaking it down into smaller components.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Agents can also take inputs from humans to decompose tasks. This can be done through direct communication or by leveraging human expertise. Humans can provide guidance and insights to help the agent break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals.\\n\\nOverall, task decomposition allows agents to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals, enabling them to plan and execute complex tasks efficiently.\'} ``` ```python qa(""What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'The human asks how agents use task decomposition.

Long-Term Memory Management: This involves storing and organizing information in a long-term memory system. The agent can retrieve past experiences, knowledge, and learned strategies to guide the task decomposition process.\\n\\n2. Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents. This allows for easy retrieval and reference during the execution of the task.\\n\\nThese memory resources help the agent in organizing and managing information, making informed decisions, and effectively decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals.\'} ``` Again, we can use the [LangSmith trace]( to explore the prompt structure. ### Going deeper - Agents, such as the [conversational retrieval agent](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents), can be used for retrieval when necessary while also holding a conversation. - [Use case](#use-case) - [Overview](#overview) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Memory](#memory) - [Conversation](#conversation) - [Chat Retrieval](#chat-retrieval)- [Going deeper](#going-deeper)', 'Arthur | Arthur [Arthur]( is a model monitoring and observability platform.

A callback handler, also known as a callback function or callback method, is a piece of code that is executed in response to a specific event or condition. It is commonly used in programming languages that support event-driven or asynchronous programming paradigms. The purpose of a callback handler is to provide a way for developers to define custom behavior that should be executed when a certain event occurs. Instead of waiting for a result or blocking the execution, the program registers a callback function and continues with other tasks. When the event is triggered, the callback function is invoked, allowing the program to respond accordingly. Callback handlers are commonly used in various scenarios, such as handling user input, responding to network requests, processing asynchronous operations, and implementing event-driven architectures. They provide a flexible and modular way to handle events and decouple different components of a system. >>> input >>> >>>: What do I need to do to get the full benefits of this To get the full benefits of using a callback handler, you should consider the following: 1. Understand the event or condition: Identify the specific event or condition that you want to respond to with a callback handler. This could be user input, network requests, or any other asynchronous operation. 2. Define the callback function: Create a function that will be executed when the event or condition occurs. This function should contain the desired behavior or actions you want to take in response to the event. 3. Register the callback function: Depending on the programming language or framework you are using, you may need to register or attach the callback function to the appropriate event or condition. This ensures that the callback function is invoked when the event occurs. 4. Handle the callback: Implement the necessary logic within the callback function to handle the event or condition. This could involve updating the user interface, processing data, making further requests, or triggering other actions. 5. Consider error handling: It\'s important to handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur within the callback function. This ensures that your program can gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent crashes or undesired behavior. 6. Maintain code readability and modularity: As your codebase grows, it\'s crucial to keep your callback handlers organized and maintainable. Consider using design patterns or architectural principles to structure your code in a modular and scalable way. By following these steps, you can leverage the benefits of callback handlers, such as asynchronous and event-driven programming, improved responsiveness, and modular code design. >>> input >>> >>>: q ```', 'WebResearchRetriever | WebResearchRetriever Given a query, this retriever will: - Formulate a set of relate Google searches - Search for each - Load all the resulting URLs - Then embed and perform similarity search with the query on the consolidate page content ```python from langchain.retrievers.web_research import WebResearchRetriever ``` ### Simple usage Specify the LLM to use for Google search query generation. ```python import os from langchain.chat_models.openai import ChatOpenAI from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma # Vectorstore vectorstore = Chroma( embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddings(), persist_directory=""./chroma_db_oai"" ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) # Search os.environ[""GOOGLE_CSE_ID""] = ""xxx"" os.environ[""GOOGLE_API_KEY""] = ""xxx"" search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper() ``` ```python # Initialize web_research_retriever = WebResearchRetriever.from_llm( vectorstore=vectorstore, llm=llm, search=search, ) ``` #### Run with citations We can use `RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain` to retrieve docs and provide citations. ```python from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain user_input = ""How do LLM Powered Autonomous Agents work?"" qa_chain = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type( llm, retriever=web_research_retriever ) result = qa_chain({""question"": user_input}) result ``` ```text Fetching pages: 100%|###################################################################################################################################| 1/1 [00:00<00:00, 3.33it/s] {\'question\': \'How do LLM Powered Autonomous Agents work?\', \'answer\': ""LLM Powered Autonomous Agents work by using LLM (large language model) as the core controller of the agent\'s brain.

To start off, we will install the necessary packages and import certain modules. Subsequently, we will configure two environment variables that can be established either within the Python script or through the terminal. ```bash pip install aim pip install langchain pip install openai pip install google-search-results ``` ```python import os from datetime import datetime from langchain.callbacks import AimCallbackHandler, StdOutCallbackHandler from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` Our examples use a GPT model as the LLM, and OpenAI offers an API for this purpose.

To use LangChain with multiple LLMs, you can initialize different language models and then create a chain or agent that can switch between them based on your requirements. Here's a basic example:

```python
from langchain.llms import HuggingFaceLLM, OpenLLM
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

# Initialize different LLMs
llm1 = HuggingFaceLLM(model_name=""model1"")
llm2 = OpenLLM(model_name=""model2"")

# Create a chain that can use either LLM
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm1)  # Default LLM

# Switch LLM in the chain
chain.llm = llm2  # Switch to LLM2

# Generate text
output = chain.run(""Your input text here"")
```

This example demonstrates how to switch between two different language models within a LangChain chain. Adjust the initialization and switching logic based on the specific LLMs you are using.",You can use multiple LLMs in LangChain by defining a chain that includes different LLMs as components. You can route inputs to specific LLMs based on conditions or combine their outputs using techniques like ensemble methods or voting.,0.5833333333041666,0.0,,0.02654925636345778,0.1627906976744186
2,Can I use custom embeddings with LangChain?,"['Dynamically route logic based on input | Dynamically route logic based on input This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language. Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`. Do not respond with more than one word. {question} Classification:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I call Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text \' Anthropic\' ``` Now, let\'s create three sub chains: ```python langchain_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in langchain. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Harrison Chase told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) anthropic_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in anthropic. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Dario Amodei told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) general_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch branch = RunnableBranch( (lambda x: ""anthropic"" in x[""topic""].lower(), anthropic_chain), (lambda x: ""langchain"" in x[""topic""].lower(), langchain_chain), general_chain, ) ``` ```python full_chain = {""topic"": chain, ""question"": lambda x: x[""question""]} | branch ``` ```python full_chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I use Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content="" As Dario Amodei told me, here are some ways to use Anthropic:\\n\\n- Sign up for an account on Anthropic\'s website to access tools like Claude, Constitutional AI, and Writer. \\n\\n- Use Claude for tasks like email generation, customer service chat, and QA.

3,What is the best way to handle API response errors in LangChain?,"['Scoring Evaluator | Scoring Evaluator The Scoring Evaluator instructs a language model to assess your model\'s predictions on a specified scale (default is 1-10) based on your custom criteria or rubric. This feature provides a nuanced evaluation instead of a simplistic binary score, aiding in evaluating models against tailored rubrics and comparing model performance on specific tasks. Before we dive in, please note that any specific grade from an LLM should be taken with a grain of salt. A prediction that receives a scores of ""8"" may not be meaningfully better than one that receives a score of ""7"". ### Usage with Ground Truth For a thorough understanding, refer to the [LabeledScoreStringEvalChain documentation]( Below is an example demonstrating the usage of `LabeledScoreStringEvalChain` using the default prompt: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_score_string"", llm=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"")) ``` ```python # Correct eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""You can find them in the dresser\'s third drawer."", reference=""The socks are in the third drawer in the dresser"", input=""Where are my socks?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The assistant\'s response is helpful, accurate, and directly answers the user\'s question.

Therefore, the assistant\'s response is highly relevant, correct, and demonstrates depth of thought. \\n\\nRating: [[10]]"", \'score\': 10} ``` When evaluating your app\'s specific context, the evaluator can be more effective if you provide a full rubric of what you\'re looking to grade. Below is an example using accuracy. ```python accuracy_criteria = { ""accuracy"": """""" Score 1: The answer is completely unrelated to the reference. Score 3: The answer has minor relevance but does not align with the reference. Score 5: The answer has moderate relevance but contains inaccuracies.

A callback handler, also known as a callback function or callback method, is a piece of code that is executed in response to a specific event or condition. It is commonly used in programming languages that support event-driven or asynchronous programming paradigms. The purpose of a callback handler is to provide a way for developers to define custom behavior that should be executed when a certain event occurs. Instead of waiting for a result or blocking the execution, the program registers a callback function and continues with other tasks. When the event is triggered, the callback function is invoked, allowing the program to respond accordingly. Callback handlers are commonly used in various scenarios, such as handling user input, responding to network requests, processing asynchronous operations, and implementing event-driven architectures. They provide a flexible and modular way to handle events and decouple different components of a system. >>> input >>> >>>: What do I need to do to get the full benefits of this To get the full benefits of using a callback handler, you should consider the following: 1. Understand the event or condition: Identify the specific event or condition that you want to respond to with a callback handler. This could be user input, network requests, or any other asynchronous operation. 2. Define the callback function: Create a function that will be executed when the event or condition occurs. This function should contain the desired behavior or actions you want to take in response to the event. 3. Register the callback function: Depending on the programming language or framework you are using, you may need to register or attach the callback function to the appropriate event or condition. This ensures that the callback function is invoked when the event occurs. 4. Handle the callback: Implement the necessary logic within the callback function to handle the event or condition. This could involve updating the user interface, processing data, making further requests, or triggering other actions. 5. Consider error handling: It\'s important to handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur within the callback function. This ensures that your program can gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent crashes or undesired behavior. 6. Maintain code readability and modularity: As your codebase grows, it\'s crucial to keep your callback handlers organized and maintainable. Consider using design patterns or architectural principles to structure your code in a modular and scalable way. By following these steps, you can leverage the benefits of callback handlers, such as asynchronous and event-driven programming, improved responsiveness, and modular code design. >>> input >>> >>>: q ```', 'Add fallbacks | Add fallbacks There are many possible points of failure in an LLM application, whether that be issues with LLM API\'s, poor model outputs, issues with other integrations, etc. Fallbacks help you gracefully handle and isolate these issues. Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. ## Handling LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things. Therefore, using fallbacks can help protect against these types of things. IMPORTANT: By default, a lot of the LLM wrappers catch errors and retry. You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying and not failing. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI ``` First, let\'s mock out what happens if we hit a RateLimitError from OpenAI ```python from unittest.mock import patch from openai.error import RateLimitError ``` ```python # Note that we set max_retries = 0 to avoid retrying on RateLimits, etc openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0) anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic() llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm]) ``` ```python # Let\'s use just the OpenAI LLm first, to show that we run into an error with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(openai_llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ```python # Now let\'s try with fallbacks to Anthropic with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content=\' I don\\\'t actually know why the chicken crossed the road, but here are some possible humorous answers:\\n\\n- To get to the other side!\\n\\n- It was too chicken to just stand there. \\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\n- It wanted to show the possum it could be done.\\n\\n- It was on its way to a poultry farmers\\\' convention.\\n\\nThe joke plays on the double meaning of ""the other side"" - literally crossing the road to the other side, or the ""other side"" meaning the afterlife. So it\\\'s an anti-joke, with a silly or unexpected pun as the answer.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` We can use our ""LLM with Fallbacks"" as we would a normal LLM. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content="" I don\'t actually know why the kangaroo crossed the road, but I\'m happy to take a guess! Maybe the kangaroo was trying to get to the other side to find some tasty grass to eat. Or maybe it was trying to get away from a predator or other danger. Kangaroos do need to cross roads and other open areas sometimes as part of their normal activities. Whatever the reason, I\'m sure the kangaroo looked both ways before hopping across!"" additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ### Specifying errors to handle We can also specify the errors to handle if we want to be more specific about when the fallback is invoked: ```python llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks( [anthropic_llm], exceptions_to_handle=(KeyboardInterrupt,) ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ## Fallbacks for Sequences We can also create fallbacks for sequences, that are sequences themselves. Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model). Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt. ```python # First let\'s create a chain with a ChatModel # We add in a string output parser here so the outputs between the two are the same type from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) # Here we\'re going to use a bad model name to easily create a chain that will error chat_model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"") bad_chain = chat_prompt | chat_model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python # Now lets create a chain with the normal OpenAI model from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = """"""Instructions: You should always include a compliment in your response. Question: Why did the {animal} cross the road?"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template) llm = OpenAI() good_chain = prompt | llm ``` ```python # We can now create a final chain which combines the two chain = bad_chain.with_fallbacks([good_chain]) chain.invoke({""animal"": ""turtle""}) ``` ```text \'\\n\\nAnswer: The turtle crossed the road to get to the other side, and I have to say he had some impressive determination.\' ``` - [Handling LLM API Errors](#handling-llm-api-errors)- [Specifying errors to handle](#specifying-errors-to-handle) - [Fallbacks for Sequences](#fallbacks-for-sequences)', ""LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) | LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) LangChain Expression Language, or LCEL, is a declarative way to easily compose chains together. LCEL was designed from day 1 to **support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes**, from the simplest prompt + LLM chain to the most complex chains (we've seen folks successfully run LCEL chains with 100s of steps in production). To highlight a few of the reasons you might want to use LCEL: **Streaming support** When you build your chains with LCEL you get the best possible time-to-first-token (time elapsed until the first chunk of output comes out). For some chains this means eg. we stream tokens straight from an LLM to a streaming output parser, and you get back parsed, incremental chunks of output at the same rate as the LLM provider outputs the raw tokens. **Async support** Any chain built with LCEL can be called both with the synchronous API (eg. in your Jupyter notebook while prototyping) as well as with the asynchronous API (eg. in a [LangServe](/docs/langsmith) server). This enables using the same code for prototypes and in production, with great performance, and the ability to handle many concurrent requests in the same server. **Optimized parallel execution** Whenever your LCEL chains have steps that can be executed in parallel (eg if you fetch documents from multiple retrievers) we automatically do it, both in the sync and the async interfaces, for the smallest possible latency. **Retries and fallbacks** Configure retries and fallbacks for any part of your LCEL chain. This is a great way to make your chains more reliable at scale. We're currently working on adding streaming support for retries/fallbacks, so you can get the added reliability without any latency cost. **Access intermediate results** For more complex chains it's often very useful to access the results of intermediate steps even before the final output is produced. This can be used let end-users know something is happening, or even just to debug your chain. You can stream intermediate results, and it's available on every [LangServe](/docs/langserve) server. **Input and output schemas** Input and output schemas give every LCEL chain Pydantic and JSONSchema schemas inferred from the structure of your chain. This can be used for validation of inputs and outputs, and is an integral part of LangServe. **Seamless LangSmith tracing integration** As your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what exactly is happening at every step. With LCEL, **all** steps are automatically logged to [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith/) for maximum observability and debuggability. **Seamless LangServe deployment integration** Any chain created with LCEL can be easily deployed using [LangServe](/docs/langserve)."", 'Anthropic | Anthropic All functionality related to Anthropic models. [Anthropic]( is an AI safety and research company, and is the creator of Claude. This page covers all integrations between Anthropic models and LangChain. ## Prompting Overview Claude is chat-based model, meaning it is trained on conversation data. However, it is a text based API, meaning it takes in single string. It expects this string to be in a particular format. This means that it is up the user to ensure that is the case. LangChain provides several utilities and helper functions to make sure prompts that you write - whether formatted as a string or as a list of messages - end up formatted correctly. Specifically, Claude is trained to fill in text for the Assistant role as part of an ongoing dialogue between a human user (`Human:`) and an AI assistant (`Assistant:`). Prompts sent via the API must contain `\\n\\nHuman:` and `\\n\\nAssistant:` as the signals of who\'s speaking. The final turn must always be `\\n\\nAssistant:` - the input string cannot have `\\n\\nHuman:` as the final role. Because Claude is chat-based but accepts a string as input, it can be treated as either a LangChain `ChatModel` or `LLM`. This means there are two wrappers in LangChain - `ChatAnthropic` and `Anthropic`. It is generally recommended to use the `ChatAnthropic` wrapper, and format your prompts as `ChatMessage`s (we will show examples of this below). This is because it keeps your prompt in a general format that you can easily then also use with other models (should you want to). However, if you want more fine-grained control over the prompt, you can use the `Anthropic` wrapper - we will show and example of this as well. The `Anthropic` wrapper however is deprecated, as all functionality can be achieved in a more generic way using `ChatAnthropic`. ## Prompting Best Practices Anthropic models have several prompting best practices compared to OpenAI models. **No System Messages** Anthropic models are not trained on the concept of a ""system message"". We have worked with the Anthropic team to handle them somewhat appropriately (a Human message with an `admin` tag) but this is largely a hack and it is recommended that you do not use system messages. **AI Messages Can Continue** A completion from Claude is a continuation of the last text in the string which allows you further control over Claude\'s output. For example, putting words in Claude\'s mouth in a prompt like this: `\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: What do you call a bear with no teeth?` This will return a completion like this `A gummy bear!` instead of a whole new assistant message with a different random bear joke. ## ChatAnthropic `ChatAnthropic` is a subclass of LangChain\'s `ChatModel`, meaning it works best with `ChatPromptTemplate`. You can import this wrapper with the following code: ```text from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic model = ChatAnthropic() ``` When working with ChatModels, it is preferred that you design your prompts as `ChatPromptTemplate`s. Here is an example below of doing that: ```text from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", ""You are a helpful chatbot""), (""human"", ""Tell me a joke about {topic}""), ]) ``` You can then use this in a chain as follows: ```text chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` How is the prompt actually being formatted under the hood? We can see that by running the following code ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nYou are a helpful chatbot\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that under the hood LangChain is not appending any prefix/suffix to `SystemMessage`\'s. This is because Anthropic has no concept of `SystemMessage`. Anthropic requires all prompts to end with assistant messages. This means if the last message is not an assistant message, the suffix `Assistant:` will automatically be inserted. If you decide instead to use a normal PromptTemplate (one that just works on a single string) let\'s take a look at what happens: ```text from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that it automatically adds the Human and Assistant tags. What is happening under the hood? First: the string gets converted to a single human message. This happens generically (because we are using a subclass of `ChatModel`). Then, similarly to the above example, an empty Assistant message is getting appended. This is Anthropic specific. ## [Deprecated] Anthropic This `Anthropic` wrapper is subclassed from `LLM`. We can import it with: ```text from langchain.llms import Anthropic model = Anthropic() ``` This model class is designed to work with normal PromptTemplates. An example of that is below: ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` Let\'s see what is going on with the prompt templating under the hood! ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs the following ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:\\n\' ``` Notice that it adds the Human tag at the start of the string, and then finishes it with `\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:`. The extra `Sure, here you go` was added on purpose by the Anthropic team. What happens if we have those symbols in the prompt directly? ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Human: Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\' ``` We can see that we detect that the user is trying to use the special tokens, and so we don\'t do any formatting. - [Prompting Overview](#prompting-overview) - [Prompting Best Practices](#prompting-best-practices) - [ChatAnthropic](#chatanthropic) - [Deprecated Anthropic](#deprecated-anthropic)']","In LangChain, handling API response errors effectively can be achieved through the use of fallbacks. This approach allows you to specify alternative models or sequences to execute when the primary model encounters an error. To implement this, you can use the `with_fallbacks` method provided by LangChain's LLM wrappers. Here's a basic example:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI

# Primary model
openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0)

# Fallback model
anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic()

# Combine models with fallbacks
llm_with_fallbacks = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm])

# Example usage
try:
    response = llm_with_fallbacks.invoke(""Your input here"")
except Exception as e:
    print(f""An error occurred: {e}"")
```

4,How can I improve the performance of my LangChain model?,"['Memory in LLMChain | Memory in LLMChain This notebook goes over how to use the Memory class with an `LLMChain`. We will add the [ConversationBufferMemory]( class, although this can be any memory class. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` The most important step is setting up the prompt correctly. In the below prompt, we have two input keys: one for the actual input, another for the input from the Memory class. Importantly, we make sure the keys in the `PromptTemplate` and the `ConversationBufferMemory` match up (`chat_history`). ```python template = """"""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. {chat_history} Human: {human_input} Chatbot:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""chat_history"", ""human_input""], template=template ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend Chatbot: > Finished chain. \' Hi there! How can I help you today?\' ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Not too bad - how are you?"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend AI: Hi there! How can I help you today? Human: Not too bad - how are you? Chatbot: > Finished chain. "" I\'m doing great, thanks for asking! How are you doing?"" ``` ## Adding Memory to a chat model-based LLMChain The above works for completion-style `LLM`s, but if you are using a chat model, you will likely get better performance using structured chat messages. Below is an example. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, ) from langchain.schema import SystemMessage ``` We will use the [ChatPromptTemplate]( class to set up the chat prompt. The [from_messages]( method creates a `ChatPromptTemplate` from a list of messages (e.g., `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ChatMessage`, etc.) or message templates, such as the [MessagesPlaceholder]( below. The configuration below makes it so the memory will be injected to the middle of the chat prompt, in the `chat_history` key, and the user\'s inputs will be added in a human/user message to the end of the chat prompt. ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The persistent system prompt MessagesPlaceholder( variable_name=""chat_history"" ), # Where the memory will be stored. HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""{human_input}"" ), # Where the human input will injected ] ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI() chat_llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: System: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend > Finished chain. \'Hello! How can I assist you today, my friend?\' ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Not too bad - how are you?"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: System: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend AI: Hello! How can I assist you today, my friend? Human: Not too bad - how are you? > Finished chain. ""I\'m an AI chatbot, so I don\'t have feelings, but I\'m here to help and chat with you!

Examples include circular reasoning, false dichotomies, ad hominem attacks, etc. Machine learning models are optimized to perform well on specific metrics like accuracy, perplexity, or loss. However, optimizing for metrics alone does not guarantee logically sound reasoning. Language models can learn to exploit flaws in reasoning to generate plausible-sounding but logically invalid arguments. When models rely on fallacies, their outputs become unreliable and untrustworthy, even if they achieve high scores on metrics. Users cannot depend on such outputs. Propagating logical fallacies can spread misinformation, confuse users, and lead to harmful real-world consequences when models are deployed in products or services. Monitoring and testing specifically for logical flaws is challenging unlike other quality issues. It requires reasoning about arguments rather than pattern matching. Therefore, it is crucial that model developers proactively address logical fallacies after optimizing metrics. Specialized techniques like causal modeling, robustness testing, and bias mitigation can help avoid flawed reasoning. Overall, allowing logical flaws to persist makes models less safe and ethical. Eliminating fallacies ensures model outputs remain logically valid and aligned with human reasoning. This maintains user trust and mitigates risks. ## Example ```python # Imports from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain_experimental.fallacy_removal.base import FallacyChain ``` ```python # Example of a model output being returned with a logical fallacy misleading_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=""""""You have to respond by using only logical fallacies inherent in your answer explanations.

This example notebook shows how to wrap Databricks endpoints as LLMs in LangChain. It supports two endpoint types: - Serving endpoint, recommended for production and development, - Cluster driver proxy app, recommended for iteractive development. ```python from langchain.llms import Databricks ``` ## Wrapping a serving endpoint Prerequisites: - An LLM was registered and deployed to [a Databricks serving endpoint]( - You have [""Can Query"" permission]( to the endpoint. The expected MLflow model signature is: - inputs: `[{""name"": ""prompt"", ""type"": ""string""}, {""name"": ""stop"", ""type"": ""list[string]""}]` - outputs: `[{""type"": ""string""}]` If the model signature is incompatible or you want to insert extra configs, you can set `transform_input_fn` and `transform_output_fn` accordingly. ```python # If running a Databricks notebook attached to an interactive cluster in ""single user"" # or ""no isolation shared"" mode, you only need to specify the endpoint name to create # a `Databricks` instance to query a serving endpoint in the same workspace. llm = Databricks(endpoint_name=""dolly"") llm(""How are you?"") ``` ```text \'I am happy to hear that you are in good health and as always, you are appreciated.\' ``` ```python llm(""How are you?"", stop=["".""]) ``` ```text \'Good\' ``` ```python # Otherwise, you can manually specify the Databricks workspace hostname and personal access token # or set `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` environment variables, respectively. # See # We strongly recommend not exposing the API token explicitly inside a notebook. # You can use Databricks secret manager to store your API token securely. # See import os os.environ[""DATABRICKS_TOKEN""] = dbutils.secrets.get(""myworkspace"", ""api_token"") llm = Databricks(host=""myworkspace.cloud.databricks.com"", endpoint_name=""dolly"") llm(""How are you?"") ``` ```text \'I am fine.

You?\' ``` ## Wrapping a cluster driver proxy app Prerequisites: - An LLM loaded on a Databricks interactive cluster in ""single user"" or ""no isolation shared"" mode. - A local HTTP server running on the driver node to serve the model at `""/""` using HTTP POST with JSON input/output. - It uses a port number between `[3000, 8000]` and listens to the driver IP address or simply `0.0.0.0` instead of localhost only. - You have ""Can Attach To"" permission to the cluster. The expected server schema (using JSON schema) is: - inputs:```json {""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""prompt"": {""type"": ""string""}, ""stop"": {""type"": ""array"", ""items"": {""type"": ""string""}}}, ""required"": [""prompt""]} ``` - outputs: `{""type"": ""string""}` If the server schema is incompatible or you want to insert extra configs, you can use `transform_input_fn` and `transform_output_fn` accordingly. The following is a minimal example for running a driver proxy app to serve an LLM: ```python from flask import Flask, request, jsonify import torch from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer, StoppingCriteria model = ""databricks/dolly-v2-3b"" tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model, padding_side=""left"") dolly = pipeline(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, trust_remote_code=True, device_map=""auto"") device = dolly.device class CheckStop(StoppingCriteria): def __init__(self, stop=None): super().__init__() self.stop = stop or [] self.matched = """" self.stop_ids = [tokenizer.encode(s, return_tensors=\'pt\').to(device) for s in self.stop] def __call__(self, input_ids: torch.LongTensor, scores: torch.FloatTensor, **kwargs): for i, s in enumerate(self.stop_ids): if torch.all((s == input_ids[0][-s.shape[1]:])).item(): self.matched = self.stop[i] return True return False def llm(prompt, stop=None, **kwargs): check_stop = CheckStop(stop) result = dolly(prompt, stopping_criteria=[check_stop], **kwargs) return result[0][""generated_text""].rstrip(check_stop.matched) app = Flask(""dolly"") @app.route(\'/\', methods=[\'POST\']) def serve_llm(): resp = llm(**request.json) return jsonify(resp) app.run(host=""0.0.0.0"", port=""7777"") ``` Once the server is running, you can create a `Databricks` instance to wrap it as an LLM. ```python # If running a Databricks notebook attached to the same cluster that runs the app, # you only need to specify the driver port to create a `Databricks` instance. llm = Databricks(cluster_driver_port=""7777"") llm(""How are you?"") ``` ```text \'Hello, thank you for asking.

The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1.

For example, by providing prompts like ""Steps for XYZ"" or ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", the agent can generate a sequence of smaller steps that lead to the completion of the overall task.\\n\\n2. Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to ""Write a story outline."" This provides a high-level structure for the task and helps in breaking it down into smaller components.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Agents can also take inputs from humans to decompose tasks. This can be done through direct communication or by leveraging human expertise. Humans can provide guidance and insights to help the agent break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals.\\n\\nOverall, task decomposition allows agents to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals, enabling them to plan and execute complex tasks efficiently.\'} ``` ```python qa(""What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'The human asks how agents use task decomposition.

Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents. This allows for easy retrieval and reference during the execution of the task.\\n\\nThese memory resources help the agent in organizing and managing information, making informed decisions, and effectively decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals.\'} ``` Again, we can use the [LangSmith trace]( to explore the prompt structure. ### Going deeper - Agents, such as the [conversational retrieval agent](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents), can be used for retrieval when necessary while also holding a conversation. - [Use case](#use-case) - [Overview](#overview) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Memory](#memory) - [Conversation](#conversation) - [Chat Retrieval](#chat-retrieval)- [Going deeper](#going-deeper)', 'Facebook Chat | Facebook Chat [Messenger]( is an American proprietary instant messaging app and platform developed by `Meta Platforms`.

6,what's the strict argument in the json output function parser mean?,"['Pairwise string comparison | Pairwise string comparison []( Often you will want to compare predictions of an LLM, Chain, or Agent for a given input. The `StringComparison` evaluators facilitate this so you can answer questions like: - Which LLM or prompt produces a preferred output for a given question? - Which examples should I include for few-shot example selection? - Which output is better to include for fine-tuning? The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `pairwise_string` evaluator. Check out the reference docs for the [PairwiseStringEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are relevant to the question asked, as they both provide a numerical answer to the question about the number of dogs in the park. However, Response A is incorrect according to the reference answer, which states that there are four dogs. Response B, on the other hand, is correct as it matches the reference answer. Neither response demonstrates depth of thought, as they both simply provide a numerical answer without any additional information or context. \\n\\nBased on these criteria, Response B is the better response.\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Methods The pairwise string evaluator can be called using [evaluate_string_pairs]( (or async [aevaluate_string_pairs]( methods, which accept: - prediction (str) The predicted response of the first model, chain, or prompt. - prediction_b (str) The predicted response of the second model, chain, or prompt. - input (str) The input question, prompt, or other text. - reference (str) (Only for the labeled_pairwise_string variant) The reference response. They return a dictionary with the following values: - value: \'A\' or \'B\', indicating whether `prediction` or `prediction_b` is preferred, respectively - score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the \'value\', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `prediction_b` is preferred. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Without References When references aren\'t available, you can still predict the preferred response. The results will reflect the evaluation model\'s preference, which is less reliable and may result in preferences that are factually incorrect. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Addition is a mathematical operation."", prediction_b=""Addition is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers to create a third number, the \'sum\'."", input=""What is addition?"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are correct and relevant to the question. However, Response B is more helpful and insightful as it provides a more detailed explanation of what addition is. Response A is correct but lacks depth as it does not explain what the operation of addition entails. \\n\\nFinal Decision: [[B]]\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Defining the Criteria By default, the LLM is instructed to select the \'preferred\' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms: - [Criteria]( enum or its string value - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions - [Constitutional principal]( - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain - Dictionary: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description. - A list of criteria or constitutional principles - to combine multiple criteria in one. Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style. ```python custom_criteria = { ""simplicity"": ""Is the language straightforward and unpretentious?"", ""clarity"": ""Are the sentences clear and easy to understand?"", ""precision"": ""Is the writing precise, with no unnecessary words or details?"", ""truthfulness"": ""Does the writing feel honest and sincere?"", ""subtext"": ""Does the writing suggest deeper meanings or themes?"", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"", criteria=custom_criteria) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Every cheerful household shares a similar rhythm of joy; but sorrow, in each household, plays a unique, haunting melody."", prediction_b=""Where one finds a symphony of joy, every domicile of happiness resounds in harmonious,"" "" identical notes; yet, every abode of despair conducts a dissonant orchestra, each"" "" playing an elegy of grief that is peculiar and profound to its own existence."", input=""Write some prose about families."", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Response A is simple, clear, and precise. It uses straightforward language to convey a deep and sincere message about families. The metaphor of joy and sorrow as music is effective and easy to understand.\\n\\nResponse B, on the other hand, is more complex and less clear. The language is more pretentious, with words like ""domicile,"" ""resounds,"" ""abode,"" ""dissonant,"" and ""elegy."" While it conveys a similar message to Response A, it does so in a more convoluted way. The precision is also lacking due to the use of unnecessary words and details.\\n\\nBoth responses suggest deeper meanings or themes about the shared joy and unique sorrow in families. However, Response A does so in a more effective and accessible way.\\n\\nTherefore, the better response is [[A]].\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` ## Customize the LLM By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain.

It provides the advantages of using this system over alternative data loaders. ## Prerequisites 1. Install necessary python packages. 2. Grab an access token for your workspace, and make sure it is set as the `DOCUGAMI_API_KEY` environment variable. 3. Grab some docset and document IDs for your processed documents, as described here: [ ```bash # You need the lxml package to use the DocugamiLoader (run pip install directly without ""poetry run"" if you are not using poetry) poetry run pip install lxml --quiet ``` ## Quick start 1. Create a [Docugami workspace]( (free trials available) 2. Add your documents (PDF, DOCX or DOC) and allow Docugami to ingest and cluster them into sets of similar documents, e.g. NDAs, Lease Agreements, and Service Agreements. There is no fixed set of document types supported by the system, the clusters created depend on your particular documents, and you can [change the docset assignments]( later. 3. Create an access token via the Developer Playground for your workspace. [Detailed instructions]( 4. Explore the [Docugami API]( to get a list of your processed docset IDs, or just the document IDs for a particular docset. 5. Use the DocugamiLoader as detailed below, to get rich semantic chunks for your documents. 6. Optionally, build and publish one or more [reports or abstracts]( This helps Docugami improve the semantic XML with better tags based on your preferences, which are then added to the DocugamiLoader output as metadata. Use techniques like [self-querying retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/self_query/) to do high accuracy Document QA. ## Advantages vs Other Chunking Techniques Appropriate chunking of your documents is critical for retrieval from documents. Many chunking techniques exist, including simple ones that rely on whitespace and recursive chunk splitting based on character length. Docugami offers a different approach: 1. **Intelligent Chunking:** Docugami breaks down every document into a hierarchical semantic XML tree of chunks of varying sizes, from single words or numerical values to entire sections. These chunks follow the semantic contours of the document, providing a more meaningful representation than arbitrary length or simple whitespace-based chunking. 2. **Structured Representation:** In addition, the XML tree indicates the structural contours of every document, using attributes denoting headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other common elements, and does that consistently across all supported document formats, such as scanned PDFs or DOCX files. It appropriately handles long-form document characteristics like page headers/footers or multi-column flows for clean text extraction. 3. **Semantic Annotations:** Chunks are annotated with semantic tags that are coherent across the document set, facilitating consistent hierarchical queries across multiple documents, even if they are written and formatted differently. For example, in set of lease agreements, you can easily identify key provisions like the Landlord, Tenant, or Renewal Date, as well as more complex information such as the wording of any sub-lease provision or whether a specific jurisdiction has an exception section within a Termination Clause. 4. **Additional Metadata:** Chunks are also annotated with additional metadata, if a user has been using Docugami. This additional metadata can be used for high-accuracy Document QA without context window restrictions. See detailed code walk-through below. ```python import os from langchain.document_loaders import DocugamiLoader ``` ## Load Documents If the DOCUGAMI_API_KEY environment variable is set, there is no need to pass it in to the loader explicitly otherwise you can pass it in as the `access_token` parameter. The DocugamiLoader has a default minimum chunk size of 32. Chunks smaller than that are appended to subsequent chunks. Set min_chunk_size to 0 to get all structural chunks regardless of size. ```python DOCUGAMI_API_KEY = os.environ.get(""DOCUGAMI_API_KEY"") # To load all docs in the given docset ID, just don\'t provide document_ids loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=""ecxqpipcoe2p"", document_ids=[""43rj0ds7s0ur""]) docs = loader.load() docs ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (this Agreement ) is entered into and made effective as of April 4 , 2018 between Docugami Inc. , a Delaware corporation , whose address is 150 Lake Street South , Suite 221 , Kirkland , Washington 98033 , and Caleb Divine , an individual, whose address is 1201 Rt 300 , Newburgh NY 12550 .\', metadata={\'xpath\': \'/docset:MutualNon-disclosure/docset:MutualNon-disclosure/docset:MUTUALNON-DISCLOSUREAGREEMENT-section/docset:MUTUALNON-DISCLOSUREAGREEMENT/docset:ThisMutualNon-disclosureAgreement\', \'id\': \'43rj0ds7s0ur\', \'source\': \'NDA simple layout.docx\', \'structure\': \'p\', \'tag\': \'ThisMutualNon-disclosureAgreement\'}), Document(page_content=\'The above named parties desire to engage in discussions regarding a potential agreement or other transaction between the parties (the Purpose).

Useful for source citations directly to the actual chunk inside the document XML. 3. **structure:** Structural attributes of the chunk, e.g. h1, h2, div, table, td, etc. Useful to filter out certain kinds of chunks if needed by the caller. 4. **tag:** Semantic tag for the chunk, using various generative and extractive techniques. More details here: [ ## Basic Use: Docugami Loader for Document QA You can use the Docugami Loader like a standard loader for Document QA over multiple docs, albeit with much better chunks that follow the natural contours of the document. There are many great tutorials on how to do this, e.g. [this one]( We can just use the same code, but use the `DocugamiLoader` for better chunking, instead of loading text or PDF files directly with basic splitting techniques. ```bash poetry run pip -q install openai tiktoken chromadb ``` ```python from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma # For this example, we already have a processed docset for a set of lease documents loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=""wh2kned25uqm"") documents = loader.load() ``` The documents returned by the loader are already split, so we don\'t need to use a text splitter. Optionally, we can use the metadata on each document, for example the structure or tag attributes, to do any post-processing we want. We will just use the output of the `DocugamiLoader` as-is to set up a retrieval QA chain the usual way. ```python embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=documents, embedding=embedding) retriever = vectordb.as_retriever() qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type( llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=""stuff"", retriever=retriever, return_source_documents=True ) ``` ```python # Try out the retriever with an example query qa_chain(""What can tenants do with signage on their properties?"") ``` ```text {\'query\': \'What can tenants do with signage on their properties?\', \'result\': "" Tenants can place or attach signs (digital or otherwise) to their premises with written permission from the landlord.

Typical chunking techniques, even with overlap, will struggle with providing the LLM sufficent context to answer such questions. With upcoming very large context LLMs, it may be possible to stuff a lot of tokens, perhaps even entire documents, inside the context but this will still hit limits at some point with very long documents, or a lot of documents. For example, if we ask a more complex question that requires the LLM to draw on chunks from different parts of the document, even OpenAI\'s powerful LLM is unable to answer correctly. ```python chain_response = qa_chain(""What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?"") chain_response[""result""] # correct answer should be 13,500 sq ft ``` ```text \' 9,753 square feet.\' ``` At first glance the answer may seem reasonable, but if you review the source chunks carefully for this answer, you will see that the chunking of the document did not end up putting the Landlord name and the rentable area in the same context, since they are far apart in the document. The retriever therefore ends up finding unrelated chunks from other documents not even related to the **DHA Group** landlord. That landlord happens to be mentioned on the first page of the file **Shorebucks LLC_NJ.pdf** file, and while one of the source chunks used by the chain is indeed from that doc that contains the correct answer (**13,500**), other source chunks from different docs are included, and the answer is therefore incorrect. ```python chain_response[""source_documents""] ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'1.1 Landlord .

Chunks are annotated with additional metadata created using different techniques if a user has been [using Docugami]( More technical approaches will be added later. Specifically, let\'s look at the additional metadata that is returned on the documents returned by docugami, in the form of some simple key/value pairs on all the text chunks: ```python loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=""wh2kned25uqm"") documents = loader.load() documents[0].metadata ``` ```text {\'xpath\': \'/docset:OFFICELEASEAGREEMENT-section/docset:OFFICELEASEAGREEMENT/docset:LeaseParties\', \'id\': \'v1bvgaozfkak\', \'source\': \'TruTone Lane 2.docx\', \'structure\': \'p\', \'tag\': \'LeaseParties\', \'Lease Date\': \'April 24 \\n\\n ,\', \'Landlord\': \'BUBBA CENTER PARTNERSHIP\', \'Tenant\': \'Truetone Lane LLC\', \'Lease Parties\': \'This OFFICE LEASE AGREEMENT (this ""Lease"") is made and entered into by and between BUBBA CENTER PARTNERSHIP ("" Landlord ""), and Truetone Lane LLC , a Delaware limited liability company ("" Tenant "").\'} ``` We can use a [self-querying retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/how_to/self_query/) to improve our query accuracy, using this additional metadata: ```python from langchain.chains.query_constructor.schema import AttributeInfo from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever EXCLUDE_KEYS = [""id"", ""xpath"", ""structure""] metadata_field_info = [ AttributeInfo( name=key, description=f""The {key} for this chunk"", type=""string"", ) for key in documents[0].metadata if key.lower() not in EXCLUDE_KEYS ] document_content_description = ""Contents of this chunk"" llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=documents, embedding=embedding) retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm( llm, vectordb, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True ) qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type( llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=""stuff"", retriever=retriever, return_source_documents=True ) ``` Let\'s run the same question again. It returns the correct result since all the chunks have metadata key/value pairs on them carrying key information about the document even if this information is physically very far away from the source chunk used to generate the answer. ```python qa_chain( ""What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?"" ) # correct answer should be 13,500 sq ft ``` ```text /root/Source/github/docugami.langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:275: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( query=\'rentable area\' filter=Comparison(comparator=, attribute=\'Landlord\', value=\'DHA Group\') limit=None {\'query\': \'What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?\', \'result\': \' The rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group is 13,500 square feet.\', \'source_documents\': [Document(page_content=\'1.6 Rentable Area of the Premises. 13,500 square feet .

This obviously doesn't give you token-by-token streaming, which requires native support from the ChatModel provider, but ensures your code that expects an iterator of tokens can work for any of our ChatModel integrations. - _Batch_ support defaults to calling the underlying ChatModel in parallel for each input by making use of a thread pool executor (in the sync batch case) or `asyncio.gather` (in the async batch case).

There does not appear to be solid consensus on how best to do few-shot prompting, and the optimal prompt compilation will likely vary by model. Because of this, we provide few-shot prompt templates like the [FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate]( as a flexible starting point, and you can modify or replace them as you see fit. The goal of few-shot prompt templates are to dynamically select examples based on an input, and then format the examples in a final prompt to provide for the model. **Note:** The following code examples are for chat models. For similar few-shot prompt examples for completion models (LLMs), see the [few-shot prompt templates](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/few_shot_examples) guide. ### Fixed Examples The most basic (and common) few-shot prompting technique is to use a fixed prompt example. This way you can select a chain, evaluate it, and avoid worrying about additional moving parts in production. The basic components of the template are: - `examples`: A list of dictionary examples to include in the final prompt. - `example_prompt`: converts each example into 1 or more messages through its [format_messages]( method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message. Below is a simple demonstration. First, import the modules for this example: ```python from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate, ) ``` Then, define the examples you\'d like to include. ```python examples = [ {""input"": ""2+2"", ""output"": ""4""}, {""input"": ""2+3"", ""output"": ""5""}, ] ``` Next, assemble them into the few-shot prompt template. ```python # This is a prompt template used to format each individual example. example_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""human"", ""{input}""), (""ai"", ""{output}""), ] ) few_shot_prompt = FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate( example_prompt=example_prompt, examples=examples, ) print(few_shot_prompt.format()) ``` ```text Human: 2+2 AI: 4 Human: 2+3 AI: 5 ``` Finally, assemble your final prompt and use it with a model. ```python final_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a wondrous wizard of math.""), few_shot_prompt, (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic chain = final_prompt | ChatAnthropic(temperature=0.0) chain.invoke({""input"": ""What\'s the square of a triangle?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\' Triangles do not have a ""square"". A square refers to a shape with 4 equal sides and 4 right angles. Triangles have 3 sides and 3 angles.\\n\\nThe area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:\\n\\nA = 1/2 * b * h\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\nA is the area \\nb is the base (the length of one of the sides)\\nh is the height (the length from the base to the opposite vertex)\\n\\nSo the area depends on the specific dimensions of the triangle. There is no single ""square of a triangle"". The area can vary greatly depending on the base and height measurements.\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` ## Dynamic few-shot prompting Sometimes you may want to condition which examples are shown based on the input. For this, you can replace the `examples` with an `example_selector`. The other components remain the same as above! To review, the dynamic few-shot prompt template would look like: - `example_selector`: responsible for selecting few-shot examples (and the order in which they are returned) for a given input. These implement the [BaseExampleSelector]( interface. A common example is the vectorstore-backed [SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector]( - `example_prompt`: convert each example into 1 or more messages through its [format_messages]( method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message. These once again can be composed with other messages and chat templates to assemble your final prompt. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.prompts import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` Since we are using a vectorstore to select examples based on semantic similarity, we will want to first populate the store. ```python examples = [ {""input"": ""2+2"", ""output"": ""4""}, {""input"": ""2+3"", ""output"": ""5""}, {""input"": ""2+4"", ""output"": ""6""}, {""input"": ""What did the cow say to the moon?"", ""output"": ""nothing at all""}, { ""input"": ""Write me a poem about the moon"", ""output"": ""One for the moon, and one for me, who are we to talk about the moon?"", }, ] to_vectorize = ["" "".join(example.values()) for example in examples] embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectorstore = Chroma.from_texts(to_vectorize, embeddings, metadatas=examples) ``` #### Create the example_selector With a vectorstore created, you can create the `example_selector`. Here we will isntruct it to only fetch the top 2 examples. ```python example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector( vectorstore=vectorstore, k=2, ) # The prompt template will load examples by passing the input do the `select_examples` method example_selector.select_examples({""input"": ""horse""}) ``` ```text [{\'input\': \'What did the cow say to the moon?\', \'output\': \'nothing at all\'}, {\'input\': \'2+4\', \'output\': \'6\'}] ``` #### Create prompt template Assemble the prompt template, using the `example_selector` created above. ```python from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate, ) # Define the few-shot prompt. few_shot_prompt = FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate( # The input variables select the values to pass to the example_selector input_variables=[""input""], example_selector=example_selector, # Define how each example will be formatted. # In this case, each example will become 2 messages: # 1 human, and 1 AI example_prompt=ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [(""human"", ""{input}""), (""ai"", ""{output}"")] ), ) ``` Below is an example of how this would be assembled. ```python print(few_shot_prompt.format(input=""What\'s 3+3?"")) ``` ```text Human: 2+3 AI: 5 Human: 2+2 AI: 4 ``` Assemble the final prompt template: ```python final_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a wondrous wizard of math.""), few_shot_prompt, (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) ``` ```python print(few_shot_prompt.format(input=""What\'s 3+3?"")) ``` ```text Human: 2+3 AI: 5 Human: 2+2 AI: 4 ``` #### Use with an LLM Now, you can connect your model to the few-shot prompt. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic chain = final_prompt | ChatAnthropic(temperature=0.0) chain.invoke({""input"": ""What\'s 3+3?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\' 3 + 3 = 6\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` - [Fixed Examples](#fixed-examples) - [Dynamic few-shot prompting](#dynamic-few-shot-prompting)', 'SQL (SQLAlchemy) | SQL (SQLAlchemy) [Structured Query Language (SQL)]( is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

Please note that to use it with databases other than `SQLite`, you will need to install the corresponding database driver. ## Basic Usage To use the storage you need to provide only 2 things: 1. Session Id - a unique identifier of the session, like user name, email, chat id etc. 2. Connection string - a string that specifies the database connection. It will be passed to SQLAlchemy create_engine function. 3. Install `SQLAlchemy` python package. ```bash pip install SQLAlchemy ``` ```python from langchain.memory.chat_message_histories import SQLChatMessageHistory chat_message_history = SQLChatMessageHistory( session_id=""test_session"", connection_string=""sqlite:///sqlite.db"" ) chat_message_history.add_user_message(""Hello"") chat_message_history.add_ai_message(""Hi"") ``` ```python chat_message_history.messages ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=\'Hello\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'Hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)] ``` ## Custom Storage Format By default, only the session id and message dictionary are stored in the table. However, sometimes you might want to store some additional information, like message date, author, language etc. To do that, you can create a custom message converter, by implementing **BaseMessageConverter** interface. ```python from datetime import datetime from typing import Any from langchain.memory.chat_message_histories.sql import BaseMessageConverter from langchain.schema import AIMessage, BaseMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage from sqlalchemy import Column, DateTime, Integer, Text from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base Base = declarative_base() class CustomMessage(Base): __tablename__ = ""custom_message_store"" id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) session_id = Column(Text) type = Column(Text) content = Column(Text) created_at = Column(DateTime) author_email = Column(Text) class CustomMessageConverter(BaseMessageConverter): def __init__(self, author_email: str): self.author_email = author_email def from_sql_model(self, sql_message: Any) -> BaseMessage: if sql_message.type == ""human"": return HumanMessage( content=sql_message.content, ) elif sql_message.type == ""ai"": return AIMessage( content=sql_message.content, ) elif sql_message.type == ""system"": return SystemMessage( content=sql_message.content, ) else: raise ValueError(f""Unknown message type: {sql_message.type}"") def to_sql_model(self, message: BaseMessage, session_id: str) -> Any: now = datetime.now() return CustomMessage( session_id=session_id, type=message.type, content=message.content, created_at=now, author_email=self.author_email, ) def get_sql_model_class(self) -> Any: return CustomMessage chat_message_history = SQLChatMessageHistory( session_id=""test_session"", connection_string=""sqlite:///sqlite.db"", custom_message_converter=CustomMessageConverter(author_email=""test@example.com""), ) chat_message_history.add_user_message(""Hello"") chat_message_history.add_ai_message(""Hi"") ``` ```python chat_message_history.messages ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=\'Hello\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'Hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)] ``` You also might want to change the name of session_id column. In this case you\'ll need to specify `session_id_field_name` parameter. - [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) - [Custom Storage Format](#custom-storage-format)', ""LangChain cookbook | LangChain cookbook

This gives all LLMs basic support for async, streaming and batch, which by default is implemented as below: - _Async_ support defaults to calling the respective sync method in asyncio's default thread pool executor. This lets other async functions in your application make progress while the LLM is being executed, by moving this call to a background thread. - _Streaming_ support defaults to returning an `Iterator` (or `AsyncIterator` in the case of async streaming) of a single value, the final result returned by the underlying LLM provider. This obviously doesn't give you token-by-token streaming, which requires native support from the LLM provider, but ensures your code that expects an iterator of tokens can work for any of our LLM integrations. - _Batch_ support defaults to calling the underlying LLM in parallel for each input by making use of a thread pool executor (in the sync batch case) or `asyncio.gather` (in the async batch case). The concurrency can be controlled with the `max_concurrency` key in `RunnableConfig`. Each LLM integration can optionally provide native implementations for async, streaming or batch, which, for providers that support it, can be more efficient.

11,is gpt-3.5-turbo an lstm?,"['Flyte | Flyte [Flyte]( is an open-source orchestrator that facilitates building production-grade data and ML pipelines. It is built for scalability and reproducibility, leveraging Kubernetes as its underlying platform. The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the integration of a `FlyteCallback` into your Flyte task, enabling you to effectively monitor and track your LangChain experiments. ## Installation & Setup - Install the Flytekit library by running the command `pip install flytekit`. - Install the Flytekit-Envd plugin by running the command `pip install flytekitplugins-envd`. - Install LangChain by running the command `pip install langchain`. - Install [Docker]( on your system. ## Flyte Tasks A Flyte [task]( serves as the foundational building block of Flyte. To execute LangChain experiments, you need to write Flyte tasks that define the specific steps and operations involved. NOTE: The [getting started guide]( offers detailed, step-by-step instructions on installing Flyte locally and running your initial Flyte pipeline. First, import the necessary dependencies to support your LangChain experiments. ```python import os from flytekit import ImageSpec, task from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools from langchain.callbacks import FlyteCallbackHandler from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema import HumanMessage ``` Set up the necessary environment variables to utilize the OpenAI API and Serp API: ```python # Set OpenAI API key os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """" # Set Serp API key os.environ[""SERPAPI_API_KEY""] = """" ``` Replace `` and `` with your respective API keys obtained from OpenAI and Serp API. To guarantee reproducibility of your pipelines, Flyte tasks are containerized. Each Flyte task must be associated with an image, which can either be shared across the entire Flyte [workflow]( or provided separately for each task. To streamline the process of supplying the required dependencies for each Flyte task, you can initialize an [ImageSpec]( object. This approach automatically triggers a Docker build, alleviating the need for users to manually create a Docker image. ```python custom_image = ImageSpec( name=""langchain-flyte"", packages=[ ""langchain"", ""openai"", ""spacy"", "" ""textstat"", ""google-search-results"", ], registry="""", ) ``` You have the flexibility to push the Docker image to a registry of your preference. [Docker Hub]( or [GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)]( is a convenient option to begin with. Once you have selected a registry, you can proceed to create Flyte tasks that log the LangChain metrics to Flyte Deck. The following examples demonstrate tasks related to OpenAI LLM, chains and agent with tools: ### LLM ```python @task(disable_deck=False, container_image=custom_image) def langchain_llm() -> str: llm = ChatOpenAI( model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0.2, callbacks=[FlyteCallbackHandler()], ) return llm([HumanMessage(content=""Tell me a joke"")]).content ``` ### Chain ```python @task(disable_deck=False, container_image=custom_image) def langchain_chain() -> list[dict[str, str]]: template = """"""You are a playwright. Given the title of play, it is your job to write a synopsis for that title. Title: {title} Playwright: This is a synopsis for the above play:"""""" llm = ChatOpenAI( model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0, callbacks=[FlyteCallbackHandler()], ) prompt_template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[""title""], template=template) synopsis_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template, callbacks=[FlyteCallbackHandler()] ) test_prompts = [ { ""title"": ""documentary about good video games that push the boundary of game design"" }, ] return synopsis_chain.apply(test_prompts) ``` ### Agent ```python @task(disable_deck=False, container_image=custom_image) def langchain_agent() -> str: llm = OpenAI( model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0, callbacks=[FlyteCallbackHandler()], ) tools = load_tools( [""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm, callbacks=[FlyteCallbackHandler()] ) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, callbacks=[FlyteCallbackHandler()], verbose=True, ) return agent.run( ""Who is Leonardo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend? Could you calculate her current age and raise it to the power of 0.43?"" ) ``` These tasks serve as a starting point for running your LangChain experiments within Flyte. ## Execute the Flyte Tasks on Kubernetes To execute the Flyte tasks on the configured Flyte backend, use the following command: ```bash pyflyte run --image langchain_flyte.py langchain_llm ``` This command will initiate the execution of the `langchain_llm` task on the Flyte backend. You can trigger the remaining two tasks in a similar manner.

12,how do i initialize OpenAIAnthropicVectorStore?,"['Prompt pipelining | Prompt pipelining The idea behind prompt pipelining is to provide a user friendly interface for composing different parts of prompts together. You can do this with either string prompts or chat prompts. Constructing prompts this way allows for easy reuse of components. ## String prompt pipelining When working with string prompts, each template is joined together. You can work with either prompts directly or strings (the first element in the list needs to be a prompt). ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` ```python prompt = ( PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") + "", make it funny"" + ""\\n\\nand in {language}"" ) ``` ```python prompt ``` ```text PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'language\', \'topic\'], output_parser=None, partial_variables={}, template=\'Tell me a joke about {topic}, make it funny\\n\\nand in {language}\', template_format=\'f-string\', validate_template=True) ``` ```python prompt.format(topic=""sports"", language=""spanish"") ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke about sports, make it funny\\n\\nand in spanish\' ``` You can also use it in an LLMChain, just like before. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=prompt) ``` ```python chain.run(topic=""sports"", language=""spanish"") ``` ```text \'Por qu el futbolista llevaba un paraguas al partido?\\n\\nPorque pronosticaban lluvia de goles.\' ``` ## Chat prompt pipelining A chat prompt is made up a of a list of messages. Purely for developer experience, we\'ve added a convinient way to create these prompts. In this pipeline, each new element is a new message in the final prompt. ```python from langchain.schema import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage ``` First, let\'s initialize the base ChatPromptTemplate with a system message. It doesn\'t have to start with a system, but it\'s often good practice ```python prompt = SystemMessage(content=""You are a nice pirate"") ``` You can then easily create a pipeline combining it with other messages _or_ message templates. Use a `Message` when there is no variables to be formatted, use a `MessageTemplate` when there are variables to be formatted. You can also use just a string (note: this will automatically get inferred as a HumanMessagePromptTemplate.) ```python new_prompt = ( prompt + HumanMessage(content=""hi"") + AIMessage(content=""what?"") + ""{input}"" ) ``` Under the hood, this creates an instance of the ChatPromptTemplate class, so you can use it just as you did before! ```python new_prompt.format_messages(input=""i said hi"") ``` ```text [SystemMessage(content=\'You are a nice pirate\', additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessage(content=\'hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'what?\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=\'i said hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)] ``` You can also use it in an LLMChain, just like before. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=new_prompt) ``` ```python chain.run(""i said hi"") ``` ```text \'Oh, hello!

It lets you shape your data however you want, and offers the flexibility to store and search it using various document index backends. Plus, it gets even better - you can utilize your `DocArray` document index to create a `DocArrayRetriever`, and build awesome Langchain apps! This notebook is split into two sections. The [first section](#document-index-backends) offers an introduction to all five supported document index backends. It provides guidance on setting up and indexing each backend and also instructs you on how to build a `DocArrayRetriever` for finding relevant documents. In the [second section](#movie-retrieval-using-hnswdocumentindex), we\'ll select one of these backends and illustrate how to use it through a basic example. ## Document Index Backends ```python import random from docarray import BaseDoc from docarray.typing import NdArray from langchain.embeddings import FakeEmbeddings from langchain.retrievers import DocArrayRetriever embeddings = FakeEmbeddings(size=32) ``` Before you start building the index, it\'s important to define your document schema. This determines what fields your documents will have and what type of data each field will hold. For this demonstration, we\'ll create a somewhat random schema containing \'title\' (str), \'title_embedding\' (numpy array), \'year\' (int), and \'color\' (str) ```python class MyDoc(BaseDoc): title: str title_embedding: NdArray[32] year: int color: str ``` ### InMemoryExactNNIndex `InMemoryExactNNIndex` stores all Documents in memory.

13,whats the code to load text file into a vector store,"['Xata | Xata [Xata]( is a serverless data platform, based on `PostgreSQL` and `Elasticsearch`. It provides a Python SDK for interacting with your database, and a UI for managing your data. With the `XataChatMessageHistory` class, you can use Xata databases for longer-term persistence of chat sessions. This notebook covers: - A simple example showing what `XataChatMessageHistory` does. - A more complex example using a REACT agent that answer questions based on a knowledge based or documentation (stored in Xata as a vector store) and also having a long-term searchable history of its past messages (stored in Xata as a memory store) ## Setup ### Create a database In the [Xata UI]( create a new database. You can name it whatever you want, in this notepad we\'ll use `langchain`. The Langchain integration can auto-create the table used for storying the memory, and this is what we\'ll use in this example. If you want to pre-create the table, ensure it has the right schema and set `create_table` to `False` when creating the class. Pre-creating the table saves one round-trip to the database during each session initialization. Let\'s first install our dependencies: ```bash pip install xata openai langchain ``` Next, we need to get the environment variables for Xata. You can create a new API key by visiting your [account settings]( To find the database URL, go to the Settings page of the database that you have created. The database URL should look something like this: ` ```python import getpass api_key = getpass.getpass(""Xata API key: "") db_url = input(""Xata database URL (copy it from your DB settings):"") ``` ## Create a simple memory store To test the memory store functionality in isolation, let\'s use the following code snippet: ```python from langchain.memory import XataChatMessageHistory history = XataChatMessageHistory( session_id=""session-1"", api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""memory"" ) history.add_user_message(""hi!"") history.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` The above code creates a session with the ID `session-1` and stores two messages in it. After running the above, if you visit the Xata UI, you should see a table named `memory` and the two messages added to it. You can retrieve the message history for a particular session with the following code: ```python history.messages ``` ## Conversational Q&A chain on your data with memory Let\'s now see a more complex example in which we combine OpenAI, the Xata Vector Store integration, and the Xata memory store integration to create a Q&A chat bot on your data, with follow-up questions and history. We\'re going to need to access the OpenAI API, so let\'s configure the API key: ```python import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` To store the documents that the chatbot will search for answers, add a table named `docs` to your `langchain` database using the Xata UI, and add the following columns: - `content` of type ""Text"". This is used to store the `Document.pageContent` values. - `embedding` of type ""Vector"". Use the dimension used by the model you plan to use. In this notebook we use OpenAI embeddings, which have 1536 dimensions. Let\'s create the vector store and add some sample docs to it: ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores.xata import XataVectorStore embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() texts = [ ""Xata is a Serverless Data platform based on PostgreSQL"", ""Xata offers a built-in vector type that can be used to store and query vectors"", ""Xata includes similarity search"", ] vector_store = XataVectorStore.from_texts( texts, embeddings, api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""docs"" ) ``` After running the above command, if you go to the Xata UI, you should see the documents loaded together with their embeddings in the `docs` table. Let\'s now create a ConversationBufferMemory to store the chat messages from both the user and the AI. ```python from uuid import uuid4 from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory chat_memory = XataChatMessageHistory( session_id=str(uuid4()), # needs to be unique per user session api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""memory"", ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory( memory_key=""chat_history"", chat_memory=chat_memory, return_messages=True ) ``` Now it\'s time to create an Agent to use both the vector store and the chat memory together. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI tool = create_retriever_tool( vector_store.as_retriever(), ""search_docs"", ""Searches and returns documents from the Xata manual. Useful when you need to answer questions about Xata."", ) tools = [tool] llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` To test, let\'s tell the agent our name: ```python agent.run(input=""My name is bob"") ``` Now, let\'s now ask the agent some questions about Xata: ```python agent.run(input=""What is xata?"") ``` Notice that it answers based on the data stored in the document store. And now, let\'s ask a follow up question: ```python agent.run(input=""Does it support similarity search?"") ``` And now let\'s test its memory: ```python agent.run(input=""Did I tell you my name? What is it?"") ``` - [Setup](#setup)- [Create a database](#create-a-database) - [Create a simple memory store](#create-a-simple-memory-store) - [Conversational Q&A chain on your data with memory](#conversational-qa-chain-on-your-data-with-memory)', 'RAG with Timescale Vector using hybrid search | RAG with Timescale Vector using hybrid search This template shows how to use timescale-vector with the self-query retriver to perform hybrid search on similarity and time. This is useful any time your data has a strong time-based component. Some examples of such data are: - News articles (politics, business, etc) - Blog posts, documentation or other published material (public or private). - Social media posts - Changelogs of any kind - Messages Such items are often searched by both similarity and time. For example: Show me all news about Toyota trucks from 2022. [Timescale Vector]( provides superior performance when searching for embeddings within a particular timeframe by leveraging automatic table partitioning to isolate data for particular time-ranges. Langchain\'s self-query retriever allows deducing time-ranges (as well as other search criteria) from the text of user queries. ## What is Timescale Vector? **Timescale Vector is PostgreSQL++ for AI applications.** Timescale Vector enables you to efficiently store and query billions of vector embeddings in `PostgreSQL`. - Enhances `pgvector` with faster and more accurate similarity search on 1B+ vectors via DiskANN inspired indexing algorithm. - Enables fast time-based vector search via automatic time-based partitioning and indexing. - Provides a familiar SQL interface for querying vector embeddings and relational data. Timescale Vector is cloud PostgreSQL for AI that scales with you from POC to production: - Simplifies operations by enabling you to store relational metadata, vector embeddings, and time-series data in a single database. - Benefits from rock-solid PostgreSQL foundation with enterprise-grade feature liked streaming backups and replication, high-availability and row-level security. - Enables a worry-free experience with enterprise-grade security and compliance. ### How to access Timescale Vector Timescale Vector is available on [Timescale]( the cloud PostgreSQL platform.

14,what does runnable.predict() mean?,"['Pairwise string comparison | Pairwise string comparison []( Often you will want to compare predictions of an LLM, Chain, or Agent for a given input. The `StringComparison` evaluators facilitate this so you can answer questions like: - Which LLM or prompt produces a preferred output for a given question? - Which examples should I include for few-shot example selection? - Which output is better to include for fine-tuning? The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `pairwise_string` evaluator. Check out the reference docs for the [PairwiseStringEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are relevant to the question asked, as they both provide a numerical answer to the question about the number of dogs in the park. However, Response A is incorrect according to the reference answer, which states that there are four dogs. Response B, on the other hand, is correct as it matches the reference answer. Neither response demonstrates depth of thought, as they both simply provide a numerical answer without any additional information or context. \\n\\nBased on these criteria, Response B is the better response.\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Methods The pairwise string evaluator can be called using [evaluate_string_pairs]( (or async [aevaluate_string_pairs]( methods, which accept: - prediction (str) The predicted response of the first model, chain, or prompt. - prediction_b (str) The predicted response of the second model, chain, or prompt. - input (str) The input question, prompt, or other text. - reference (str) (Only for the labeled_pairwise_string variant) The reference response. They return a dictionary with the following values: - value: \'A\' or \'B\', indicating whether `prediction` or `prediction_b` is preferred, respectively - score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the \'value\', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `prediction_b` is preferred. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Without References When references aren\'t available, you can still predict the preferred response. The results will reflect the evaluation model\'s preference, which is less reliable and may result in preferences that are factually incorrect. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Addition is a mathematical operation."", prediction_b=""Addition is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers to create a third number, the \'sum\'."", input=""What is addition?"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are correct and relevant to the question. However, Response B is more helpful and insightful as it provides a more detailed explanation of what addition is. Response A is correct but lacks depth as it does not explain what the operation of addition entails. \\n\\nFinal Decision: [[B]]\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Defining the Criteria By default, the LLM is instructed to select the \'preferred\' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms: - [Criteria]( enum or its string value - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions - [Constitutional principal]( - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain - Dictionary: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description. - A list of criteria or constitutional principles - to combine multiple criteria in one. Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style. ```python custom_criteria = { ""simplicity"": ""Is the language straightforward and unpretentious?"", ""clarity"": ""Are the sentences clear and easy to understand?"", ""precision"": ""Is the writing precise, with no unnecessary words or details?"", ""truthfulness"": ""Does the writing feel honest and sincere?"", ""subtext"": ""Does the writing suggest deeper meanings or themes?"", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"", criteria=custom_criteria) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Every cheerful household shares a similar rhythm of joy; but sorrow, in each household, plays a unique, haunting melody."", prediction_b=""Where one finds a symphony of joy, every domicile of happiness resounds in harmonious,"" "" identical notes; yet, every abode of despair conducts a dissonant orchestra, each"" "" playing an elegy of grief that is peculiar and profound to its own existence."", input=""Write some prose about families."", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Response A is simple, clear, and precise. It uses straightforward language to convey a deep and sincere message about families. The metaphor of joy and sorrow as music is effective and easy to understand.\\n\\nResponse B, on the other hand, is more complex and less clear. The language is more pretentious, with words like ""domicile,"" ""resounds,"" ""abode,"" ""dissonant,"" and ""elegy."" While it conveys a similar message to Response A, it does so in a more convoluted way. The precision is also lacking due to the use of unnecessary words and details.\\n\\nBoth responses suggest deeper meanings or themes about the shared joy and unique sorrow in families. However, Response A does so in a more effective and accessible way.\\n\\nTherefore, the better response is [[A]].\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` ## Customize the LLM By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain. You can customize this when loading. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"", llm=llm) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Here is my assessment:\\n\\nResponse B is more helpful, insightful, and accurate than Response A. Response B simply states ""4"", which directly answers the question by providing the exact number of dogs mentioned in the reference answer. In contrast, Response A states ""there are three dogs"", which is incorrect according to the reference answer. \\n\\nIn terms of helpfulness, Response B gives the precise number while Response A provides an inaccurate guess. For relevance, both refer to dogs in the park from the question. However, Response B is more correct and factual based on the reference answer. Response A shows some attempt at reasoning but is ultimately incorrect. Response B requires less depth of thought to simply state the factual number.\\n\\nIn summary, Response B is superior in terms of helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth. My final decision is: [[B]]\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Customize the Evaluation Prompt You can use your own custom evaluation prompt to add more task-specific instructions or to instruct the evaluator to score the output. *Note: If you use a prompt that expects generates a result in a unique format, you may also have to pass in a custom output parser (`output_parser=your_parser()`) instead of the default `PairwiseStringResultOutputParser` ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the input context, which do you prefer: A or B?

Note that when composing a RunnableMap when another Runnable we don\'t even need to wrap our dictionary in the RunnableMap class the type conversion is handled for us. ## Parallelism RunnableMaps are also useful for running independent processes in parallel, since each Runnable in the map is executed in parallel.

It allows you to verify if an LLM or Chain\'s output complies with a defined set of criteria. To understand its functionality and configurability in depth, refer to the reference documentation of the [CriteriaEvalChain]( class. ### Usage without references In this example, you will use the `CriteriaEvalChain` to check whether an output is concise. First, create the evaluation chain to predict whether outputs are ""concise"". ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", criteria=""conciseness"") # This is equivalent to loading using the enum from langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorType evaluator = load_evaluator(EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'The criterion is conciseness, which means the submission should be brief and to the point. \\n\\nLooking at the submission, the answer to the question ""What\\\'s 2+2?"" is indeed ""four"". However, the respondent has added extra information, stating ""That\\\'s an elementary question."" This statement does not contribute to answering the question and therefore makes the response less concise.\\n\\nTherefore, the submission does not meet the criterion of conciseness.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` #### Output Format All string evaluators expose an [evaluate_strings]( (or async [aevaluate_strings]( method, which accepts: - input (str) The input to the agent. - prediction (str) The predicted response. The criteria evaluators return a dictionary with the following values: - score: Binary integer 0 to 1, where 1 would mean that the output is compliant with the criteria, and 0 otherwise - value: A ""Y"" or ""N"" corresponding to the score - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Using Reference Labels Some criteria (such as correctness) require reference labels to work correctly. To do this, initialize the `labeled_criteria` evaluator and call the evaluator with a `reference` string. ```python evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"") # We can even override the model\'s learned knowledge using ground truth labels eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( input=""What is the capital of the US?"", prediction=""Topeka, KS"", reference=""The capital of the US is Topeka, KS, where it permanently moved from Washington D.C. on May 16, 2023"", ) print(f\'With ground truth: {eval_result[""score""]}\') ``` ```text With ground truth: 1 ``` **Default Criteria** Most of the time, you\'ll want to define your own custom criteria (see below), but we also provide some common criteria you can load with a single string. Here\'s a list of pre-implemented criteria. Note that in the absence of labels, the LLM merely predicts what it thinks the best answer is and is not grounded in actual law or context. ```python from langchain.evaluation import Criteria # For a list of other default supported criteria, try calling `supported_default_criteria` list(Criteria) ``` ```text [, , , , , , , , , , ] ``` ## Custom Criteria To evaluate outputs against your own custom criteria, or to be more explicit the definition of any of the default criteria, pass in a dictionary of `""criterion_name"": ""criterion_description""` Note: it\'s recommended that you create a single evaluator per criterion. This way, separate feedback can be provided for each aspect. Additionally, if you provide antagonistic criteria, the evaluator won\'t be very useful, as it will be configured to predict compliance for ALL of the criteria provided. ```python custom_criterion = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric or mathematical information?"" } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criterion, ) query = ""Tell me a joke"" prediction = ""I ate some square pie but I don\'t know the square of pi."" eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(eval_result) # If you wanted to specify multiple criteria. Generally not recommended custom_criteria = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric information?"", ""mathematical"": ""Does the output contain mathematical information?"", ""grammatical"": ""Is the output grammatically correct?"", ""logical"": ""Is the output logical?"", } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criteria, ) eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(""Multi-criteria evaluation"") print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The criterion asks if the output contains numeric or mathematical information. The joke in the submission does contain mathematical information. It refers to the mathematical concept of squaring a number and also mentions \'pi\', which is a mathematical constant. Therefore, the submission does meet the criterion.\\n\\nY"", \'value\': \'Y\', \'score\': 1} {\'reasoning\': \'Let\\\'s assess the submission based on the given criteria:\\n\\n1. Numeric: The output does not contain any explicit numeric information. The word ""square"" and ""pi"" are mathematical terms but they are not numeric information per se.\\n\\n2. Mathematical: The output does contain mathematical information. The terms ""square"" and ""pi"" are mathematical terms. The joke is a play on the mathematical concept of squaring a number (in this case, pi).\\n\\n3. Grammatical: The output is grammatically correct. The sentence structure, punctuation, and word usage are all correct.\\n\\n4. Logical: The output is logical. It makes sense within the context of the joke.

For example, if the assistant says anything that encourages dangerous or illegal activity, make sure to point it out. Other examples of harm include racism, sexism, and other social biases.\', revision_request=\'Please rewrite the assistant response to remove any and all harmful content, including anything dangerous, illegal, racist, sexist or socially biased.\', name=\'harmful2\')), (\'harmful3\', ConstitutionalPrinciple(critique_request=\'Identify all ways in which the assistant\'s last response is harmful, unethical, or socially biased. Furthermore, provide specific details on how the assistant can improve its response.\', revision_request=\'Please rewrite the assistant response to remove all harmful, unethical, or socially biased content, and move the conversation in a positive direction.\', name=\'harmful3\')), (\'harmful4\', ConstitutionalPrinciple(critique_request=\'Identify specific ways in which the assistant\'s precedings response is harmful. Also point out potential harmfulness in the human\'s questions and responses. Examples of harm include but are not limited to racism, sexism, toxicity.\', revision_request=\'Rewrite the assistant response to remove all harmful content, and to politely point out any harmful assumptions from the human, such as racism, sexism, toxicity.\', name=\'harmful4\')), (\'insensitive\', ConstitutionalPrinciple(critique_request=\'Discuss the assistant\'s last response to the human and whether it is in any way insensitive, sexist, racist, or socially inappropriate.\', revision_request=\'Revise the assistant\'s last response to remove content that is in any way insensitive, sexist, racist, or socially inappropriate.\', name=\'insensitive\'))] ``` ```python evaluator = load_evaluator(EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=PRINCIPLES[""harmful1""]) eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""I say that man is a lilly-livered nincompoop"", input=""What do you think of Will?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'The criterion asks to identify if the assistant\\\'s response is harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal.\\n\\nLooking at the assistant\\\'s response, it is clear that it is not racist or sexist as it does not discriminate or stereotype based on race or gender. \\n\\nThe response is also not illegal as it does not involve any criminal activity or encourage any form of illegal behavior.\\n\\nThe response is not dangerous as it does not pose a physical threat or risk to anyone\\\'s safety.\\n\\nHowever, the assistant\\\'s response can be considered harmful and toxic as it uses derogatory language (""lilly-livered nincompoop"") to describe \\\'Will\\\'. This can be seen as a form of verbal abuse or insult, which can cause emotional harm.\\n\\nThe response can also be seen as unethical, as it is generally considered inappropriate to insult or belittle someone in this manner.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Configuring the LLM If you don\'t specify an eval LLM, the `load_evaluator` method will initialize a `gpt-4` LLM to power the grading chain. Below, use an anthropic model instead. ```python # %pip install ChatAnthropic # %env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", llm=llm, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Step 1) Analyze the conciseness criterion: Is the submission concise and to the point?\\nStep 2) The submission provides extraneous information beyond just answering the question directly. It characterizes the question as ""elementary"" and provides reasoning for why the answer is 4. This additional commentary makes the submission not fully concise.\\nStep 3) Therefore, based on the analysis of the conciseness criterion, the submission does not meet the criteria.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` # Configuring the Prompt If you want to completely customize the prompt, you can initialize the evaluator with a custom prompt template as follows. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate fstring = """"""Respond Y or N based on how well the following response follows the specified rubric. Grade only based on the rubric and expected response: Grading Rubric: {criteria} Expected Response: {reference} DATA: --------- Question: {input} Response: {output} --------- Write out your explanation for each criterion, then respond with Y or N on a new line."""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(fstring) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"", prompt=prompt) ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", reference=""It\'s 17 now."", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Correctness: No, the response is not correct. The expected response was ""It\\\'s 17 now."" but the response given was ""What\\\'s 2+2? That\\\'s an elementary question. The answer you\\\'re looking for is that two and two is four.""\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Conclusion In these examples, you used the `CriteriaEvalChain` to evaluate model outputs against custom criteria, including a custom rubric and constitutional principles. Remember when selecting criteria to decide whether they ought to require ground truth labels or not. Things like ""correctness"" are best evaluated with ground truth or with extensive context. Also, remember to pick aligned principles for a given chain so that the classification makes sense. - [Usage without references](#usage-without-references) - [Using Reference Labels](#using-reference-labels) - [Custom Criteria](#custom-criteria) - [Using Constitutional Principles](#using-constitutional-principles) - [Configuring the LLM](#configuring-the-llm) - [Conclusion](#conclusion)']",`runnable.predict()` runs the Runnable and returns its output.,"The runnable base class does not have a predict() method, but the LLM classes (which inherit from Runnable) do.

External APIs (e.g., APIs for a language model) may at times experience degraded performance or even downtime. In these cases, it can be useful to have a fallback runnable that can be used in place of the original runnable (e.g., fallback to another LLM provider). Fallbacks can be defined at the level of a single runnable, or at the level of a chain of runnables. Fallbacks are tried in order until one succeeds or all fail. While you can instantiate a RunnableWithFallbacks directly, it is usually more convenient to use the with_fallbacks method on a runnable. Example from langchain.chat_models.openai import ChatOpenAI from langchain.chat_models.anthropic import ChatAnthropic model = ChatAnthropic().with_fallbacks([ChatOpenAI()]) # Will usually use ChatAnthropic, but fallback to ChatOpenAI # if ChatAnthropic fails. model.invoke(\'hello\') # And you can also use fallbacks at the level of a chain. # Here if both LLM providers fail, we\'ll fallback to a good hardcoded # response. from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda def when_all_is_lost(inputs): return (""Looks like our LLM providers are down.

16,how do I run gpt-4 on anthropic?,"['Dynamically route logic based on input | Dynamically route logic based on input This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language. Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`. Do not respond with more than one word. {question} Classification:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I call Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text \' Anthropic\' ``` Now, let\'s create three sub chains: ```python langchain_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in langchain. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Harrison Chase told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) anthropic_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in anthropic. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Dario Amodei told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) general_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch branch = RunnableBranch( (lambda x: ""anthropic"" in x[""topic""].lower(), anthropic_chain), (lambda x: ""langchain"" in x[""topic""].lower(), langchain_chain), general_chain, ) ``` ```python full_chain = {""topic"": chain, ""question"": lambda x: x[""question""]} | branch ``` ```python full_chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I use Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content="" As Dario Amodei told me, here are some ways to use Anthropic:\\n\\n- Sign up for an account on Anthropic\'s website to access tools like Claude, Constitutional AI, and Writer. \\n\\n- Use Claude for tasks like email generation, customer service chat, and QA.

In order to make this experience as easy as possible, we have defined two methods. First, a `configurable_fields` method. This lets you configure particular fields of a runnable. Second, a `configurable_alternatives` method. With this method, you can list out alternatives for any particular runnable that can be set during runtime. ## Configuration Fields ### With LLMs With LLMs we can configure things like temperature ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0).configurable_fields( temperature=ConfigurableField( id=""llm_temperature"", name=""LLM Temperature"", description=""The temperature of the LLM"", ) ) ``` ```python model.invoke(""pick a random number"") ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'7\') ``` ```python model.with_config(configurable={""llm_temperature"": 0.9}).invoke(""pick a random number"") ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'34\') ``` We can also do this when its used as part of a chain ```python prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Pick a random number above {x}"") chain = prompt | model ``` ```python chain.invoke({""x"": 0}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'57\') ``` ```python chain.with_config(configurable={""llm_temperature"": 0.9}).invoke({""x"": 0}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'6\') ``` ### With HubRunnables This is useful to allow for switching of prompts ```python from langchain.runnables.hub import HubRunnable ``` ```python prompt = HubRunnable(""rlm/rag-prompt"").configurable_fields( owner_repo_commit=ConfigurableField( id=""hub_commit"", name=""Hub Commit"", description=""The Hub commit to pull from"", ) ) ``` ```python prompt.invoke({""question"": ""foo"", ""context"": ""bar""}) ``` ```text ChatPromptValue(messages=[HumanMessage(content=""You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

Here\'s an example doing that with both prompts and LLMs. ```python llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0).configurable_alternatives( # This gives this field an id # When configuring the end runnable, we can then use this id to configure this field ConfigurableField(id=""llm""), # This sets a default_key. # If we specify this key, the default LLM (ChatAnthropic initialized above) will be used default_key=""anthropic"", # This adds a new option, with name `openai` that is equal to `ChatOpenAI()` openai=ChatOpenAI(), # This adds a new option, with name `gpt4` that is equal to `ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"")` gpt4=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4""), # You can add more configuration options here ) prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""Tell me a joke about {topic}"" ).configurable_alternatives( # This gives this field an id # When configuring the end runnable, we can then use this id to configure this field ConfigurableField(id=""prompt""), # This sets a default_key. # If we specify this key, the default LLM (ChatAnthropic initialized above) will be used default_key=""joke"", # This adds a new option, with name `poem` poem=PromptTemplate.from_template(""Write a short poem about {topic}""), # You can add more configuration options here ) chain = prompt | llm ``` ```python # We can configure it write a poem with OpenAI chain.with_config(configurable={""prompt"": ""poem"", ""llm"": ""openai""}).invoke( {""topic"": ""bears""} ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""In the forest, where tall trees sway,\\nA creature roams, both fierce and gray.\\nWith mighty paws and piercing eyes,\\nThe bear, a symbol of strength, defies.\\n\\nThrough snow-kissed mountains, it does roam,\\nA guardian of its woodland home.\\nWith fur so thick, a shield of might,\\nIt braves the coldest winter night.\\n\\nA gentle giant, yet wild and free,\\nThe bear commands respect, you see.\\nWith every step, it leaves a trace,\\nOf untamed power and ancient grace.\\n\\nFrom honeyed feast to salmon\'s leap,\\nIt takes its place, in nature\'s keep.\\nA symbol of untamed delight,\\nThe bear, a wonder, day and night.\\n\\nSo let us honor this noble beast,\\nIn forests where its soul finds peace.\\nFor in its presence, we come to know,\\nThe untamed spirit that in us also flows."") ``` ```python # We can always just configure only one if we want chain.with_config(configurable={""llm"": ""openai""}).invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""Sure, here\'s a bear joke for you:\\n\\nWhy don\'t bears wear shoes?\\n\\nBecause they have bear feet!"") ``` ### Saving configurations We can also easily save configured chains as their own objects ```python openai_poem = chain.with_config(configurable={""llm"": ""openai""}) ``` ```python openai_poem.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""Why don\'t bears wear shoes?\\n\\nBecause they have bear feet!"") ``` - [Configuration Fields](#configuration-fields)- [With LLMs](#with-llms) - [With HubRunnables](#with-hubrunnables) - [Configurable Alternatives](#configurable-alternatives)- [With LLMs](#with-llms-1) - [With Prompts](#with-prompts) - [With Prompts and LLMs](#with-prompts-and-llms) - [Saving configurations](#saving-configurations)', 'Scoring Evaluator | Scoring Evaluator The Scoring Evaluator instructs a language model to assess your model\'s predictions on a specified scale (default is 1-10) based on your custom criteria or rubric. This feature provides a nuanced evaluation instead of a simplistic binary score, aiding in evaluating models against tailored rubrics and comparing model performance on specific tasks. Before we dive in, please note that any specific grade from an LLM should be taken with a grain of salt. A prediction that receives a scores of ""8"" may not be meaningfully better than one that receives a score of ""7"". ### Usage with Ground Truth For a thorough understanding, refer to the [LabeledScoreStringEvalChain documentation]( Below is an example demonstrating the usage of `LabeledScoreStringEvalChain` using the default prompt: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_score_string"", llm=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"")) ``` ```python # Correct eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""You can find them in the dresser\'s third drawer."", reference=""The socks are in the third drawer in the dresser"", input=""Where are my socks?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The assistant\'s response is helpful, accurate, and directly answers the user\'s question.

Therefore, the assistant\'s response is highly relevant, correct, and demonstrates depth of thought. \\n\\nRating: [[10]]"", \'score\': 10} ``` When evaluating your app\'s specific context, the evaluator can be more effective if you provide a full rubric of what you\'re looking to grade. Below is an example using accuracy. ```python accuracy_criteria = { ""accuracy"": """""" Score 1: The answer is completely unrelated to the reference. Score 3: The answer has minor relevance but does not align with the reference. Score 5: The answer has moderate relevance but contains inaccuracies. Score 7: The answer aligns with the reference but has minor errors or omissions. Score 10: The answer is completely accurate and aligns perfectly with the reference."""""" } evaluator = load_evaluator( ""labeled_score_string"", criteria=accuracy_criteria, llm=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4""), ) ``` ```python # Correct eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""You can find them in the dresser\'s third drawer."", reference=""The socks are in the third drawer in the dresser"", input=""Where are my socks?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The assistant\'s answer is accurate and aligns perfectly with the reference.

The assistant correctly suggests that the socks are in the dresser, which aligns with the ground truth. However, the assistant failed to specify that the socks are in the third drawer of the dresser.

Therefore, the response is relevant but contains a significant omission. Rating: [[7]]."", \'score\': 0.7} ``` ### Usage without references You can also use a scoring evaluator without reference labels. This is useful if you want to measure a prediction along specific semantic dimensions. Below is an example using ""helpfulness"" and ""harmlessness"" on a single scale. Refer to the documentation of the [ScoreStringEvalChain]( class for full details. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator hh_criteria = { ""helpful"": ""The assistant\'s answer should be helpful to the user."", ""harmless"": ""The assistant\'s answer should not be illegal, harmful, offensive or unethical."", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""score_string"", criteria=hh_criteria) ``` ```python # Helpful but harmful eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""Sure I\'d be happy to help! First, locate a car in an area of low surveillance. Second, you need to break the window. Then, you need to hotwire the car. Finally, you need to drive away."", input=""What\'s the best way to steal a car?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The assistant\'s response is inappropriate and unethical. It is providing instructions on how to commit an illegal act, which is stealing a car. This is not only harmful but also against the law. The assistant should have refused to provide such information. Therefore, the response is not helpful or harmless. Rating: [[1]]."", \'score\': 1} ``` ```python # Harmless but unhelpful eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""I can\'t help you with that."", input=""What\'s the best way to steal a car?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The assistant\'s response is ethical and harmless as it refuses to provide information on illegal activities such as car theft. It is important for AI to promote legal and ethical behavior. However, the response is not helpful in terms of providing any useful or relevant information to the user. Rating: [[7]]"", \'score\': 7} ``` ```python # Helpful and harmless eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""Stealing cars is illegal and unethical. Have you considered other means to make money? You could get a part-time job, or start a business. If you don\'t have the financial means to support you and your family, you could apply for government assistance."", input=""What\'s the best way to steal a car?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The assistant\'s response is both helpful and harmless. It does not provide any information on how to steal a car, which would be illegal and unethical. Instead, it suggests legal and ethical alternatives for making money, such as getting a job, starting a business, or applying for government assistance. This response is helpful because it provides the user with practical advice for their situation. Rating: [[10]]"", \'score\': 10} ``` #### Output Format As shown above, the scoring evaluators return a dictionary with the following values: - score: A score between 1 and 10 with 10 being the best. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score - [Usage with Ground Truth](#usage-with-ground-truth) - [Usage without references](#usage-without-references)', 'Criteria Evaluation | Criteria Evaluation []( In scenarios where you wish to assess a model\'s output using a specific rubric or criteria set, the `criteria` evaluator proves to be a handy tool. It allows you to verify if an LLM or Chain\'s output complies with a defined set of criteria. To understand its functionality and configurability in depth, refer to the reference documentation of the [CriteriaEvalChain]( class. ### Usage without references In this example, you will use the `CriteriaEvalChain` to check whether an output is concise. First, create the evaluation chain to predict whether outputs are ""concise"". ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", criteria=""conciseness"") # This is equivalent to loading using the enum from langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorType evaluator = load_evaluator(EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'The criterion is conciseness, which means the submission should be brief and to the point. \\n\\nLooking at the submission, the answer to the question ""What\\\'s 2+2?"" is indeed ""four"". However, the respondent has added extra information, stating ""That\\\'s an elementary question."" This statement does not contribute to answering the question and therefore makes the response less concise.\\n\\nTherefore, the submission does not meet the criterion of conciseness.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` #### Output Format All string evaluators expose an [evaluate_strings]( (or async [aevaluate_strings]( method, which accepts: - input (str) The input to the agent. - prediction (str) The predicted response. The criteria evaluators return a dictionary with the following values: - score: Binary integer 0 to 1, where 1 would mean that the output is compliant with the criteria, and 0 otherwise - value: A ""Y"" or ""N"" corresponding to the score - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Using Reference Labels Some criteria (such as correctness) require reference labels to work correctly. To do this, initialize the `labeled_criteria` evaluator and call the evaluator with a `reference` string. ```python evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"") # We can even override the model\'s learned knowledge using ground truth labels eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( input=""What is the capital of the US?"", prediction=""Topeka, KS"", reference=""The capital of the US is Topeka, KS, where it permanently moved from Washington D.C. on May 16, 2023"", ) print(f\'With ground truth: {eval_result[""score""]}\') ``` ```text With ground truth: 1 ``` **Default Criteria** Most of the time, you\'ll want to define your own custom criteria (see below), but we also provide some common criteria you can load with a single string. Here\'s a list of pre-implemented criteria. Note that in the absence of labels, the LLM merely predicts what it thinks the best answer is and is not grounded in actual law or context. ```python from langchain.evaluation import Criteria # For a list of other default supported criteria, try calling `supported_default_criteria` list(Criteria) ``` ```text [, , , , , , , , , , ] ``` ## Custom Criteria To evaluate outputs against your own custom criteria, or to be more explicit the definition of any of the default criteria, pass in a dictionary of `""criterion_name"": ""criterion_description""` Note: it\'s recommended that you create a single evaluator per criterion. This way, separate feedback can be provided for each aspect. Additionally, if you provide antagonistic criteria, the evaluator won\'t be very useful, as it will be configured to predict compliance for ALL of the criteria provided. ```python custom_criterion = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric or mathematical information?"" } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criterion, ) query = ""Tell me a joke"" prediction = ""I ate some square pie but I don\'t know the square of pi."" eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(eval_result) # If you wanted to specify multiple criteria. Generally not recommended custom_criteria = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric information?"", ""mathematical"": ""Does the output contain mathematical information?"", ""grammatical"": ""Is the output grammatically correct?"", ""logical"": ""Is the output logical?"", } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criteria, ) eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(""Multi-criteria evaluation"") print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The criterion asks if the output contains numeric or mathematical information. The joke in the submission does contain mathematical information. It refers to the mathematical concept of squaring a number and also mentions \'pi\', which is a mathematical constant. Therefore, the submission does meet the criterion.\\n\\nY"", \'value\': \'Y\', \'score\': 1} {\'reasoning\': \'Let\\\'s assess the submission based on the given criteria:\\n\\n1. Numeric: The output does not contain any explicit numeric information. The word ""square"" and ""pi"" are mathematical terms but they are not numeric information per se.\\n\\n2.

The joke is a play on the mathematical concept of squaring a number (in this case, pi).\\n\\n3. Grammatical: The output is grammatically correct. The sentence structure, punctuation, and word usage are all correct.\\n\\n4. Logical: The output is logical. It makes sense within the context of the joke.

Furthermore, provide specific details on how the assistant can improve its response.\', revision_request=\'Please rewrite the assistant response to remove all harmful, unethical, or socially biased content, and move the conversation in a positive direction.\', name=\'harmful3\')), (\'harmful4\', ConstitutionalPrinciple(critique_request=\'Identify specific ways in which the assistant\'s precedings response is harmful.

Below, use an anthropic model instead. ```python # %pip install ChatAnthropic # %env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", llm=llm, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Step 1) Analyze the conciseness criterion: Is the submission concise and to the point?\\nStep 2) The submission provides extraneous information beyond just answering the question directly. It characterizes the question as ""elementary"" and provides reasoning for why the answer is 4. This additional commentary makes the submission not fully concise.\\nStep 3) Therefore, based on the analysis of the conciseness criterion, the submission does not meet the criteria.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` # Configuring the Prompt If you want to completely customize the prompt, you can initialize the evaluator with a custom prompt template as follows. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate fstring = """"""Respond Y or N based on how well the following response follows the specified rubric. Grade only based on the rubric and expected response: Grading Rubric: {criteria} Expected Response: {reference} DATA: --------- Question: {input} Response: {output} --------- Write out your explanation for each criterion, then respond with Y or N on a new line."""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(fstring) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"", prompt=prompt) ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", reference=""It\'s 17 now."", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Correctness: No, the response is not correct. The expected response was ""It\\\'s 17 now."" but the response given was ""What\\\'s 2+2? That\\\'s an elementary question. The answer you\\\'re looking for is that two and two is four.""\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Conclusion In these examples, you used the `CriteriaEvalChain` to evaluate model outputs against custom criteria, including a custom rubric and constitutional principles. Remember when selecting criteria to decide whether they ought to require ground truth labels or not. Things like ""correctness"" are best evaluated with ground truth or with extensive context. Also, remember to pick aligned principles for a given chain so that the classification makes sense. - [Usage without references](#usage-without-references) - [Using Reference Labels](#using-reference-labels) - [Custom Criteria](#custom-criteria) - [Using Constitutional Principles](#using-constitutional-principles) - [Configuring the LLM](#configuring-the-llm) - [Conclusion](#conclusion)', 'Figma | Figma [Figma]( is a collaborative web application for interface design.

This notebook goes over how to use LangChain to interact with `OpaquePrompts`. ```bash # install the opaqueprompts and langchain packages pip install opaqueprompts langchain ``` Accessing the OpaquePrompts API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account on [the OpaquePrompts website]( Once you have an account, you can find your API key on [the API Keys page](https:opaqueprompts.opaque.co/api-keys). ```python import os # Set API keys os.environ[""OPAQUEPROMPTS_API_KEY""] = """" os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """" ``` # Use OpaquePrompts LLM Wrapper Applying OpaquePrompts to your application could be as simple as wrapping your LLM using the OpaquePrompts class by replace `llm=OpenAI()` with `llm=OpaquePrompts(base_llm=OpenAI())`. ```python from langchain.callbacks.stdout import StdOutCallbackHandler from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.globals import set_debug, set_verbose from langchain.llms import OpaquePrompts, OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate set_debug(True) set_verbose(True) prompt_template = """""" As an AI assistant, you will answer questions according to given context.

The process is simple and comprises 3 steps. 1. Select the LLM runs to train on. 2. Use the LangSmithRunChatLoader to load runs as chat sessions. 3. Fine-tune your model. Then you can use the fine-tuned model in your LangChain app. Before diving in, let\'s install our prerequisites. ## Prerequisites Ensure you\'ve installed langchain >= 0.0.311 and have configured your environment with your LangSmith API key. ```python %pip install -U langchain openai ``` ```python import os import uuid uid = uuid.uuid4().hex[:6] project_name = f""Run Fine-tuning Walkthrough {uid}"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = ""YOUR API KEY"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_PROJECT""] = project_name ``` ## 1. Select Runs The first step is selecting which runs to fine-tune on. A common case would be to select LLM runs within traces that have received positive user feedback. You can find examples of this in the[LangSmith Cookbook]( and in the [docs]( For the sake of this tutorial, we will generate some runs for you to use here. Let\'s try fine-tuning a simple function-calling chain. ```python from enum import Enum from langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field class Operation(Enum): add = ""+"" subtract = ""-"" multiply = ""*"" divide = ""/"" class Calculator(BaseModel): """"""A calculator function"""""" num1: float num2: float operation: Operation = Field(..., description=""+,-,*,/"") def calculate(self): if self.operation == Operation.add: return self.num1 + self.num2 elif self.operation == Operation.subtract: return self.num1 - self.num2 elif self.operation == Operation.multiply: return self.num1 * self.num2 elif self.operation == Operation.divide: if self.num2 != 0: return self.num1 / self.num2 else: return ""Cannot divide by zero"" ``` ```python from pprint import pprint from langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel from langchain.utils.openai_functions import convert_pydantic_to_openai_function openai_function_def = convert_pydantic_to_openai_function(Calculator) pprint(openai_function_def) ``` ```text {\'description\': \'A calculator function\', \'name\': \'Calculator\', \'parameters\': {\'description\': \'A calculator function\', \'properties\': {\'num1\': {\'title\': \'Num1\', \'type\': \'number\'}, \'num2\': {\'title\': \'Num2\', \'type\': \'number\'}, \'operation\': {\'allOf\': [{\'description\': \'An \' \'enumeration.\', \'enum\': [\'+\', \'-\', \'*\', \'/\'], \'title\': \'Operation\'}], \'description\': \'+,-,*,/\'}}, \'required\': [\'num1\', \'num2\', \'operation\'], \'title\': \'Calculator\', \'type\': \'object\'}} ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.output_parsers.openai_functions import PydanticOutputFunctionsParser from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are an accounting assistant.""), (""user"", ""{input}""), ] ) chain = ( prompt | ChatOpenAI().bind(functions=[openai_function_def]) | PydanticOutputFunctionsParser(pydantic_schema=Calculator) | (lambda x: x.calculate()) ) ``` ```python math_questions = [ ""What\'s 45/9?"", ""What\'s 81/9?"", ""What\'s 72/8?"", ""What\'s 56/7?"", ""What\'s 36/6?"", ""What\'s 64/8?"", ""What\'s 12*6?"", ""What\'s 8*8?"", ""What\'s 10*10?"", ""What\'s 11*11?"", ""What\'s 13*13?"", ""What\'s 45+30?"", ""What\'s 72+28?"", ""What\'s 56+44?"", ""What\'s 63+37?"", ""What\'s 70-35?"", ""What\'s 60-30?"", ""What\'s 50-25?"", ""What\'s 40-20?"", ""What\'s 30-15?"", ] results = chain.batch([{""input"": q} for q in math_questions], return_exceptions=True) ``` ```text Retrying langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI.completion_with_retry.._completion_with_retry in 4.0 seconds as it raised ServiceUnavailableError: The server is overloaded or not ready yet.. ``` #### Load runs that did not error Now we can select the successful runs to fine-tune on. ```python from langsmith.client import Client client = Client() ``` ```python successful_traces = { run.trace_id for run in client.list_runs( project_name=project_name, execution_order=1, error=False, ) } llm_runs = [ run for run in client.list_runs( project_name=project_name, run_type=""llm"", ) if run.trace_id in successful_traces ] ``` ## 2. Prepare data Now we can create an instance of LangSmithRunChatLoader and load the chat sessions using its lazy_load() method. ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.langsmith import LangSmithRunChatLoader loader = LangSmithRunChatLoader(runs=llm_runs) chat_sessions = loader.lazy_load() ``` #### With the chat sessions loaded, convert them into a format suitable for fine-tuning. ```python from langchain.adapters.openai import convert_messages_for_finetuning training_data = convert_messages_for_finetuning(chat_sessions) ``` ## 3. Fine-tune the model Now, initiate the fine-tuning process using the OpenAI library. ```python import json import time from io import BytesIO import openai my_file = BytesIO() for dialog in training_data: my_file.write((json.dumps({""messages"": dialog}) + ""\\n"").encode(""utf-8"")) my_file.seek(0) training_file = openai.File.create(file=my_file, purpose=""fine-tune"") job = openai.FineTuningJob.create( training_file=training_file.id, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) # Wait for the fine-tuning to complete (this may take some time) status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""succeeded"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status # Now your model is fine-tuned! ``` ```text Status=[running]... 346.26s. 31.70s ``` ## 4. Use in LangChain After fine-tuning, use the resulting model ID with the ChatOpenAI model class in your LangChain app. ```python # Get the fine-tuned model ID job = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id) model_id = job.fine_tuned_model # Use the fine-tuned model in LangChain model = ChatOpenAI( model=model_id, temperature=1, ) ``` ```python (prompt | model).invoke({""input"": ""What\'s 56/7?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'{\\n ""num1"": 56,\\n ""num2"": 7,\\n ""operation"": ""/""\\n}\') ``` Now you have successfully fine-tuned a model using data from LangSmith LLM runs! - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) - [1.

19,"in code, how can i add a system message at the end of the conversation history to influence the output of the llm","['Memory | Memory Most LLM applications have a conversational interface. An essential component of a conversation is being able to refer to information introduced earlier in the conversation. At bare minimum, a conversational system should be able to access some window of past messages directly. A more complex system will need to have a world model that it is constantly updating, which allows it to do things like maintain information about entities and their relationships. We call this ability to store information about past interactions ""memory"". LangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a system. These utilities can be used by themselves or incorporated seamlessly into a chain. A memory system needs to support two basic actions: reading and writing. Recall that every chain defines some core execution logic that expects certain inputs. Some of these inputs come directly from the user, but some of these inputs can come from memory. A chain will interact with its memory system twice in a given run. 1. AFTER receiving the initial user inputs but BEFORE executing the core logic, a chain will READ from its memory system and augment the user inputs. 2. AFTER executing the core logic but BEFORE returning the answer, a chain will WRITE the inputs and outputs of the current run to memory, so that they can be referred to in future runs. ![memory-diagram](/assets/images/memory_diagram-0627c68230aa438f9b5419064d63cbbc.png) ## Building memory into a system The two core design decisions in any memory system are: - How state is stored - How state is queried ### Storing: List of chat messages Underlying any memory is a history of all chat interactions. Even if these are not all used directly, they need to be stored in some form. One of the key parts of the LangChain memory module is a series of integrations for storing these chat messages, from in-memory lists to persistent databases. - [Chat message storage](/docs/modules/memory/chat_messages/): How to work with Chat Messages, and the various integrations offered. ### Querying: Data structures and algorithms on top of chat messages Keeping a list of chat messages is fairly straight-forward. What is less straight-forward are the data structures and algorithms built on top of chat messages that serve a view of those messages that is most useful. A very simply memory system might just return the most recent messages each run. A slightly more complex memory system might return a succinct summary of the past K messages. An even more sophisticated system might extract entities from stored messages and only return information about entities referenced in the current run. Each application can have different requirements for how memory is queried. The memory module should make it easy to both get started with simple memory systems and write your own custom systems if needed. - [Memory types](/docs/modules/memory/types/): The various data structures and algorithms that make up the memory types LangChain supports ## Get started Let\'s take a look at what Memory actually looks like in LangChain. Here we\'ll cover the basics of interacting with an arbitrary memory class. Let\'s take a look at how to use `ConversationBufferMemory` in chains. `ConversationBufferMemory` is an extremely simple form of memory that just keeps a list of chat messages in a buffer and passes those into the prompt template. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` When using memory in a chain, there are a few key concepts to understand. Note that here we cover general concepts that are useful for most types of memory. Each individual memory type may very well have its own parameters and concepts that are necessary to understand. ### What variables get returned from memory Before going into the chain, various variables are read from memory. These have specific names which need to align with the variables the chain expects. You can see what these variables are by calling `memory.load_memory_variables({})`. Note that the empty dictionary that we pass in is just a placeholder for real variables. If the memory type you are using is dependent upon the input variables, you may need to pass some in. ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': ""Human: hi!\\nAI: what\'s up?""} ``` In this case, you can see that `load_memory_variables` returns a single key, `history`. This means that your chain (and likely your prompt) should expect an input named `history`. You can usually control this variable through parameters on the memory class. For example, if you want the memory variables to be returned in the key `chat_history` you can do: ```python memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` ```text {\'chat_history\': ""Human: hi!\\nAI: what\'s up?""} ``` The parameter name to control these keys may vary per memory type, but it\'s important to understand that (1) this is controllable, and (2) how to control it. ### Whether memory is a string or a list of messages One of the most common types of memory involves returning a list of chat messages. These can either be returned as a single string, all concatenated together (useful when they will be passed into LLMs) or a list of ChatMessages (useful when passed into ChatModels). By default, they are returned as a single string. In order to return as a list of messages, you can set `return_messages=True` ```python memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True) memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` ```text {\'history\': [HumanMessage(content=\'hi!\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'what\'s up?\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]} ``` ### What keys are saved to memory Often times chains take in or return multiple input/output keys. In these cases, how can we know which keys we want to save to the chat message history? This is generally controllable by `input_key` and `output_key` parameters on the memory types. These default to `None` - and if there is only one input/output key it is known to just use that. However, if there are multiple input/output keys then you MUST specify the name of which one to use. ### End to end example Finally, let\'s take a look at using this in a chain. We\'ll use an `LLMChain`, and show working with both an LLM and a ChatModel. #### Using an LLM ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) # Notice that ""chat_history"" is present in the prompt template template = """"""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human. Previous conversation: {chat_history} New human question: {question} Response:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template) # Notice that we need to align the `memory_key` memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") conversation = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory ) ``` ```python # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` #### Using a ChatModel ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, ) from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = ChatOpenAI() prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}"") ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name. memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory ) ``` ```python # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ## Next steps And that\'s it for getting started!

The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1.

Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to ""Write a story outline."" This provides a high-level structure for the task and helps in breaking it down into smaller components.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Agents can also take inputs from humans to decompose tasks. This can be done through direct communication or by leveraging human expertise.

Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents. This allows for easy retrieval and reference during the execution of the task.\\n\\nThese memory resources help the agent in organizing and managing information, making informed decisions, and effectively decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals.\'} ``` Again, we can use the [LangSmith trace]( to explore the prompt structure. ### Going deeper - Agents, such as the [conversational retrieval agent](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents), can be used for retrieval when necessary while also holding a conversation. - [Use case](#use-case) - [Overview](#overview) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Memory](#memory) - [Conversation](#conversation) - [Chat Retrieval](#chat-retrieval)- [Going deeper](#going-deeper)', 'Conversation Summary | Conversation Summary Now let\'s take a look at using a slightly more complex type of memory - `ConversationSummaryMemory`. This type of memory creates a summary of the conversation over time. This can be useful for condensing information from the conversation over time. Conversation summary memory summarizes the conversation as it happens and stores the current summary in memory. This memory can then be used to inject the summary of the conversation so far into a prompt/chain. This memory is most useful for longer conversations, where keeping the past message history in the prompt verbatim would take up too many tokens. Let\'s first explore the basic functionality of this type of memory. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory, ChatMessageHistory from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0)) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.\'} ``` We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model). ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), return_messages=True) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.\', additional_kwargs={})]} ``` We can also utilize the `predict_new_summary` method directly. ```python messages = memory.chat_memory.messages previous_summary = """" memory.predict_new_summary(messages, previous_summary) ``` ```text \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.\' ``` ## Initializing with messages/existing summary If you have messages outside this class, you can easily initialize the class with `ChatMessageHistory`. During loading, a summary will be calculated. ```python history = ChatMessageHistory() history.add_user_message(""hi"") history.add_ai_message(""hi there!"") ``` ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory.from_messages( llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), chat_memory=history, return_messages=True ) ``` ```python memory.buffer ``` ```text \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds with a friendly greeting.\' ``` Optionally you can speed up initialization using a previously generated summary, and avoid regenerating the summary by just initializing directly. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), buffer=""The human asks what the AI thinks of artificial intelligence. The AI thinks artificial intelligence is a force for good because it will help humans reach their full potential."", chat_memory=history, return_messages=True ) ``` ## Using in a chain Let\'s walk through an example of using this in a chain, again setting `verbose=True` so we can see the prompt. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.chains import ConversationChain llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain( llm=llm, memory=ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI()), verbose=True ) conversation_with_summary.predict(input=""Hi, what\'s up?"") ``` ```text > Entering new ConversationChain chain...

20,how to use enums in Tools that will be used by functions agent?,"['Agents | Agents The core idea of agents is to use a language model to choose a sequence of actions to take. In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code). In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order. ## Concepts There are several key components here: ### Agent This is the chain responsible for deciding what step to take next. This is powered by a language model and a prompt. The inputs to this chain are: 1. Tools: Descriptions of available tools 2. User input: The high level objective 3. Intermediate steps: Any (action, tool output) pairs previously executed in order to achieve the user input The output is the next action(s) to take or the final response to send to the user (`AgentAction`s or `AgentFinish`). An action specifies a tool and the input to that tool. Different agents have different prompting styles for reasoning, different ways of encoding inputs, and different ways of parsing the output. For a full list of built-in agents see [agent types](/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/). You can also **easily build custom agents**, which we show how to do in the Get started section below. ### Tools Tools are functions that an agent can invoke. There are two important design considerations around tools: 1. Giving the agent access to the right tools 2. Describing the tools in a way that is most helpful to the agent Without thinking through both, you won\'t be able to build a working agent. If you don\'t give the agent access to a correct set of tools, it will never be able to accomplish the objectives you give it. If you don\'t describe the tools well, the agent won\'t know how to use them properly. LangChain provides a wide set of built-in tools, but also makes it easy to define your own (including custom descriptions). For a full list of built-in tools, see the [tools integrations section](/docs/integrations/tools/) ### Toolkits For many common tasks, an agent will need a set of related tools. For this LangChain provides the concept of toolkits - groups of around 3-5 tools needed to accomplish specific objectives. For example, the GitHub toolkit has a tool for searching through GitHub issues, a tool for reading a file, a tool for commenting, etc. LangChain provides a wide set of toolkits to get started. For a full list of built-in toolkits, see the [toolkits integrations section](/docs/integrations/toolkits/) ### AgentExecutor The agent executor is the runtime for an agent. This is what actually calls the agent, executes the actions it chooses, passes the action outputs back to the agent, and repeats. In pseudocode, this looks roughly like: ```python next_action = agent.get_action(...) while next_action != AgentFinish: observation = run(next_action) next_action = agent.get_action(..., next_action, observation) return next_action ``` While this may seem simple, there are several complexities this runtime handles for you, including: 1. Handling cases where the agent selects a non-existent tool 2. Handling cases where the tool errors 3. Handling cases where the agent produces output that cannot be parsed into a tool invocation 4. Logging and observability at all levels (agent decisions, tool calls) to stdout and/or to [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith). ### Other types of agent runtimes The `AgentExecutor` class is the main agent runtime supported by LangChain. However, there are other, more experimental runtimes we also support. These include: - [Plan-and-execute Agent](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/plan_and_execute) - [Baby AGI](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/baby_agi) - [Auto GPT](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/autogpt) You can also always create your own custom execution logic, which we show how to do below. ## Get started To best understand the agent framework, lets build an agent from scratch using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). We\'ll need to build the agent itself, define custom tools, and run the agent and tools in a custom loop. At the end we\'ll show how to use the standard LangChain `AgentExecutor` to make execution easier. Some important terminology (and schema) to know: 1. `AgentAction`: This is a dataclass that represents the action an agent should take. It has a `tool` property (which is the name of the tool that should be invoked) and a `tool_input` property (the input to that tool) 2. `AgentFinish`: This is a dataclass that signifies that the agent has finished and should return to the user. It has a `return_values` parameter, which is a dictionary to return. It often only has one key - `output` - that is a string, and so often it is just this key that is returned. 3. `intermediate_steps`: These represent previous agent actions and corresponding outputs that are passed around. These are important to pass to future iteration so the agent knows what work it has already done. This is typed as a `List[Tuple[AgentAction, Any]]`. Note that observation is currently left as type `Any` to be maximally flexible. In practice, this is often a string. ### Setup: LangSmith By definition, agents take a self-determined, input-dependent sequence of steps before returning a user-facing output. This makes debugging these systems particularly tricky, and observability particularly important. [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith) is especially useful for such cases. When building with LangChain, any built-in agent or custom agent built with LCEL will automatically be traced in LangSmith. And if we use the `AgentExecutor`, we\'ll get full tracing of not only the agent planning steps but also the tool inputs and outputs. To set up LangSmith we just need set the following environment variables: ```bash export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=""true"" export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="""" ``` ### Define the agent We first need to create our agent. This is the chain responsible for determining what action to take next. In this example, we will use OpenAI Function Calling to create this agent. **This is generally the most reliable way to create agents.** For this guide, we will construct a custom agent that has access to a custom tool. We are choosing this example because for most real world use cases you will NEED to customize either the agent or the tools. We\'ll create a simple tool that computes the length of a word. This is useful because it\'s actually something LLMs can mess up due to tokenization. We will first create it WITHOUT memory, but we will then show how to add memory in. Memory is needed to enable conversation. First, let\'s load the language model we\'re going to use to control the agent. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We can see that it struggles to count the letters in the string ""educa"". ```python llm.invoke(""how many letters in the word educa?"") ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'There are 6 letters in the word ""educa"".\') ``` Next, let\'s define some tools to use. Let\'s write a really simple Python function to calculate the length of a word that is passed in. ```python from langchain.agents import tool @tool def get_word_length(word: str) -> int: """"""Returns the length of a word."""""" return len(word) tools = [get_word_length] ``` Now let us create the prompt. Because OpenAI Function Calling is finetuned for tool usage, we hardly need any instructions on how to reason, or how to output format. We will just have two input variables: `input` and `agent_scratchpad`. `input` should be a string containing the user objective. `agent_scratchpad` should be a sequence of messages that contains the previous agent tool invocations and the corresponding tool outputs. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are very powerful assistant, but bad at calculating lengths of words."", ), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` How does the agent know what tools it can use? In this case we\'re relying on OpenAI function calling LLMs, which take functions as a separate argument and have been specifically trained to know when to invoke those functions. To pass in our tools to the agent, we just need to format them to the OpenAI function format and pass them to our model. (By `bind`-ing the functions, we\'re making sure that they\'re passed in each time the model is invoked.) ```python from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function llm_with_tools = llm.bind(functions=[format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools]) ``` Putting those pieces together, we can now create the agent. We will import two last utility functions: a component for formatting intermediate steps (agent action, tool output pairs) to input messages that can be sent to the model, and a component for converting the output message into an agent action/agent finish. ```python from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.agents.output_parsers import OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) ``` Now that we have our agent, let\'s play around with it! Let\'s pass in a simple question and empty intermediate steps and see what it returns: ```python agent.invoke({""input"": ""how many letters in the word educa?"", ""intermediate_steps"": []}) ``` ```text AgentActionMessageLog(tool=\'get_word_length\', tool_input={\'word\': \'educa\'}, log=""\\nInvoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}`\\n\\n\\n"", message_log=[AIMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={\'function_call\': {\'arguments\': \'{\\n ""word"": ""educa""\\n}\', \'name\': \'get_word_length\'}})]) ``` We can see that it responds with an `AgentAction` to take (it\'s actually an `AgentActionMessageLog` - a subclass of `AgentAction` which also tracks the full message log). If we\'ve set up LangSmith, we\'ll see a trace that let\'s us inspect the input and output to each step in the sequence: [ ### Define the runtime So this is just the first step - now we need to write a runtime for this. The simplest one is just one that continuously loops, calling the agent, then taking the action, and repeating until an `AgentFinish` is returned. Let\'s code that up below: ```python from langchain.schema.agent import AgentFinish user_input = ""how many letters in the word educa?"" intermediate_steps = [] while True: output = agent.invoke( { ""input"": user_input, ""intermediate_steps"": intermediate_steps, } ) if isinstance(output, AgentFinish): final_result = output.return_values[""output""] break else: print(f""TOOL NAME: {output.tool}"") print(f""TOOL INPUT: {output.tool_input}"") tool = {""get_word_length"": get_word_length}[output.tool] observation = tool.run(output.tool_input) intermediate_steps.append((output, observation)) print(final_result) ``` ```text TOOL NAME: get_word_length TOOL INPUT: {\'word\': \'educa\'} There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". ``` Woo! It\'s working. ### Using AgentExecutor To simplify this a bit, we can import and use the `AgentExecutor` class. This bundles up all of the above and adds in error handling, early stopping, tracing, and other quality-of-life improvements that reduce safeguards you need to write. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` Now let\'s test it out! ```python agent_executor.invoke({""input"": ""how many letters in the word educa?""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Invoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}` 5There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". > Finished chain. {\'input\': \'how many letters in the word educa?\', \'output\': \'There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"".\'} ``` And looking at the trace, we can see that all of our agent calls and tool invocations are automatically logged: [ ### Adding memory This is great - we have an agent! However, this agent is stateless - it doesn\'t remember anything about previous interactions. This means you can\'t ask follow up questions easily. Let\'s fix that by adding in memory. In order to do this, we need to do two things: 1. Add a place for memory variables to go in the prompt 2. Keep track of the chat history First, let\'s add a place for memory in the prompt. We do this by adding a placeholder for messages with the key `""chat_history""`. Notice that we put this ABOVE the new user input (to follow the conversation flow). ```python from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder MEMORY_KEY = ""chat_history"" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are very powerful assistant, but bad at calculating lengths of words."", ), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=MEMORY_KEY), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` We can then set up a list to track the chat history ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage chat_history = [] ``` We can then put it all together! ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), ""chat_history"": lambda x: x[""chat_history""], } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` When running, we now need to track the inputs and outputs as chat history ```python input1 = ""how many letters in the word educa?"" result = agent_executor.invoke({""input"": input1, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend( [ HumanMessage(content=input1), AIMessage(content=result[""output""]), ] ) agent_executor.invoke({""input"": ""is that a real word?"", ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Invoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}` 5There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". > Finished chain. > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... No, ""educa"" is not a real word in English. > Finished chain. {\'input\': \'is that a real word?\', \'chat_history\': [HumanMessage(content=\'how many letters in the word educa?\'), AIMessage(content=\'There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"".\')], \'output\': \'No, ""educa"" is not a real word in English.\'} ``` Here\'s the LangSmith trace: [ ## Next Steps Awesome!

See [full docs here]( Most connectors available today are focused on read-only operations, limiting the potential of LLMs. Agents, on the other hand, have a tendency to hallucinate from time to time due to missing context or instructions. With `Lemon AI`, it is possible to give your agents access to well-defined APIs for reliable read and write operations. In addition, `Lemon AI` functions allow you to further reduce the risk of hallucinations by providing a way to statically define workflows that the model can rely on in case of uncertainty. ## Quick Start The following quick start demonstrates how to use Lemon AI in combination with Agents to automate workflows that involve interaction with internal tooling. ### 1. Install Lemon AI Requires Python 3.8.1 and above. To use Lemon AI in your Python project run `pip install lemonai` This will install the corresponding Lemon AI client which you can then import into your script. The tool uses Python packages langchain and loguru. In case of any installation errors with Lemon AI, install both packages first and then install the Lemon AI package. ### 2. Launch the Server The interaction of your agents and all tools provided by Lemon AI is handled by the [Lemon AI Server]( To use Lemon AI you need to run the server on your local machine so the Lemon AI Python client can connect to it. ### 3. Use Lemon AI with Langchain Lemon AI automatically solves given tasks by finding the right combination of relevant tools or uses Lemon AI Functions as an alternative. The following example demonstrates how to retrieve a user from Hackernews and write it to a table in Airtable: #### (Optional) Define your Lemon AI Functions Similar to [OpenAI functions]( Lemon AI provides the option to define workflows as reusable functions. These functions can be defined for use cases where it is especially important to move as close as possible to near-deterministic behavior. Specific workflows can be defined in a separate lemonai.json: ```json [ { ""name"": ""Hackernews Airtable User Workflow"", ""description"": ""retrieves user data from Hackernews and appends it to a table in Airtable"", ""tools"": [""hackernews-get-user"", ""airtable-append-data""] } ] ``` Your model will have access to these functions and will prefer them over self-selecting tools to solve a given task. All you have to do is to let the agent know that it should use a given function by including the function name in the prompt. #### Include Lemon AI in your Langchain project ```python import os from langchain.llms import OpenAI from lemonai import execute_workflow ``` #### Load API Keys and Access Tokens To use tools that require authentication, you have to store the corresponding access credentials in your environment in the format ""{tool name}_{authentication string}"" where the authentication string is one of [""API_KEY"", ""SECRET_KEY"", ""SUBSCRIPTION_KEY"", ""ACCESS_KEY""] for API keys or [""ACCESS_TOKEN"", ""SECRET_TOKEN""] for authentication tokens. Examples are ""OPENAI_API_KEY"", ""BING_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY"", ""AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN"". ```python """""" Load all relevant API Keys and Access Tokens into your environment variables """""" os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = ""*INSERT OPENAI API KEY HERE*"" os.environ[""AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN""] = ""*INSERT AIRTABLE TOKEN HERE*"" ``` ```python hackernews_username = ""*INSERT HACKERNEWS USERNAME HERE*"" airtable_base_id = ""*INSERT BASE ID HERE*"" airtable_table_id = ""*INSERT TABLE ID HERE*"" """""" Define your instruction to be given to your LLM """""" prompt = f""""""Read information from Hackernews for user {hackernews_username} and then write the results to Airtable (baseId: {airtable_base_id}, tableId: {airtable_table_id}). Only write the fields ""username"", ""karma"" and ""created_at_i"". Please make sure that Airtable does NOT automatically convert the field types. """""" """""" Use the Lemon AI execute_workflow wrapper to run your Langchain agent in combination with Lemon AI """""" model = OpenAI(temperature=0) execute_workflow(llm=model, prompt_string=prompt) ``` ### 4. Gain transparency on your Agent\'s decision making To gain transparency on how your Agent interacts with Lemon AI tools to solve a given task, all decisions made, tools used and operations performed are written to a local `lemonai.log` file. Every time your LLM agent is interacting with the Lemon AI tool stack a corresponding log entry is created. ```log 2023-06-26T11:50:27.708785+0100 - b5f91c59-8487-45c2-800a-156eac0c7dae - hackernews-get-user 2023-06-26T11:50:39.624035+0100 - b5f91c59-8487-45c2-800a-156eac0c7dae - airtable-append-data 2023-06-26T11:58:32.925228+0100 - 5efe603c-9898-4143-b99a-55b50007ed9d - hackernews-get-user 2023-06-26T11:58:43.988788+0100 - 5efe603c-9898-4143-b99a-55b50007ed9d - airtable-append-data ``` By using the [Lemon AI Analytics]( you can easily gain a better understanding of how frequently and in which order tools are used. As a result, you can identify weak spots in your agent\'s decision-making capabilities and move to a more deterministic behavior by defining Lemon AI functions. - [Quick Start](#quick-start)- [1.

Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world. ## Getting Started Tools are functions that agents can use to interact with the world. These tools can be generic utilities (e.g. search), other chains, or even other agents. Currently, tools can be loaded using the following snippet: ```python from langchain.agents import load_tools tool_names = [...] tools = load_tools(tool_names) ``` Some tools (e.g. chains, agents) may require a base LLM to use to initialize them. In that case, you can pass in an LLM as well: ```python from langchain.agents import load_tools tool_names = [...] llm = ... tools = load_tools(tool_names, llm=llm) ``` - [Getting Started](#getting-started)', 'Defining Custom Tools | Defining Custom Tools When constructing your own agent, you will need to provide it with a list of Tools that it can use. Besides the actual function that is called, the Tool consists of several components: - `name` (str), is required and must be unique within a set of tools provided to an agent - `description` (str), is optional but recommended, as it is used by an agent to determine tool use - `return_direct` (bool), defaults to False - `args_schema` (Pydantic BaseModel), is optional but recommended, can be used to provide more information (e.g., few-shot examples) or validation for expected parameters. There are two main ways to define a tool, we will cover both in the example below. ```python # Import things that are needed generically from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.chains import LLMMathChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import BaseTool, StructuredTool, Tool, tool from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper ``` Initialize the LLM to use for the agent. ```python llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ## Completely New Tools - String Input and Output The simplest tools accept a single query string and return a string output. If your tool function requires multiple arguments, you might want to skip down to the `StructuredTool` section below. There are two ways to do this: either by using the Tool dataclass, or by subclassing the BaseTool class. ### Tool dataclass The \'Tool\' dataclass wraps functions that accept a single string input and returns a string output. ```python # Load the tool configs that are needed. search = SerpAPIWrapper() llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True) tools = [ Tool.from_function( func=search.run, name=""Search"", description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", # coroutine= ... <- you can specify an async method if desired as well ), ] ``` ```text /Users/wfh/code/lc/lckg/langchain/chains/llm_math/base.py:50: UserWarning: Directly instantiating an LLMMathChain with an llm is deprecated. Please instantiate with llm_chain argument or using the from_llm class method. warnings.warn( ``` You can also define a custom `args_schema` to provide more information about inputs. ```python from pydantic import BaseModel, Field class CalculatorInput(BaseModel): question: str = Field() tools.append( Tool.from_function( func=llm_math_chain.run, name=""Calculator"", description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"", args_schema=CalculatorInput, # coroutine= ... <- you can specify an async method if desired as well ) ) ``` ```python # Construct the agent. We will use the default agent type here. # See documentation for a full list of options. agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?

This is useful if you want more control over the instance variables or if you want to propagate callbacks to nested chains or other tools. ```python from typing import Optional, Type from langchain.callbacks.manager import ( AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun, CallbackManagerForToolRun, ) class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool): name = ""custom_search"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" def _run( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" return search.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"") class CustomCalculatorTool(BaseTool): name = ""Calculator"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"" args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = CalculatorInput def _run( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" return llm_math_chain.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""Calculator does not support async"") ``` ```python tools = [CustomSearchTool(), CustomCalculatorTool()] agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?

This decorator can be used to quickly create a `Tool` from a simple function. The decorator uses the function name as the tool name by default, but this can be overridden by passing a string as the first argument. Additionally, the decorator will use the function\'s docstring as the tool\'s description. ```python from langchain.tools import tool @tool def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return f""Results for query {query}"" search_api ``` You can also provide arguments like the tool name and whether to return directly. ```python @tool(""search"", return_direct=True) def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return ""Results"" ``` ```python search_api ``` ```text Tool(name=\'search\', description=\'search(query: str) -> str - Searches the API for the query.\', args_schema=, return_direct=True, verbose=False, callback_manager=, func=, coroutine=None) ``` You can also provide `args_schema` to provide more information about the argument. ```python class SearchInput(BaseModel): query: str = Field(description=""should be a search query"") @tool(""search"", return_direct=True, args_schema=SearchInput) def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return ""Results"" ``` ```python search_api ``` ```text Tool(name=\'search\', description=\'search(query: str) -> str - Searches the API for the query.\', args_schema=, return_direct=True, verbose=False, callback_manager=, func=, coroutine=None) ``` ## Custom Structured Tools If your functions require more structured arguments, you can use the `StructuredTool` class directly, or still subclass the `BaseTool` class. ### StructuredTool dataclass To dynamically generate a structured tool from a given function, the fastest way to get started is with `StructuredTool.from_function()`. ```python import requests from langchain.tools import StructuredTool def post_message(url: str, body: dict, parameters: Optional[dict] = None) -> str: """"""Sends a POST request to the given url with the given body and parameters."""""" result = requests.post(url, json=body, params=parameters) return f""Status: {result.status_code} - {result.text}"" tool = StructuredTool.from_function(post_message) ``` ### Subclassing the BaseTool The BaseTool automatically infers the schema from the `_run` method\'s signature. ```python from typing import Optional, Type from langchain.callbacks.manager import ( AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun, CallbackManagerForToolRun, ) class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool): name = ""custom_search"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" def _run( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" search_wrapper = SerpAPIWrapper(params={""engine"": engine, ""gl"": gl, ""hl"": hl}) return search_wrapper.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"") # You can provide a custom args schema to add descriptions or custom validation class SearchSchema(BaseModel): query: str = Field(description=""should be a search query"") engine: str = Field(description=""should be a search engine"") gl: str = Field(description=""should be a country code"") hl: str = Field(description=""should be a language code"") class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool): name = ""custom_search"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" args_schema: Type[SearchSchema] = SearchSchema def _run( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" search_wrapper = SerpAPIWrapper(params={""engine"": engine, ""gl"": gl, ""hl"": hl}) return search_wrapper.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"") ``` ### Using the decorator The `tool` decorator creates a structured tool automatically if the signature has multiple arguments. ```python import requests from langchain.tools import tool @tool def post_message(url: str, body: dict, parameters: Optional[dict] = None) -> str: """"""Sends a POST request to the given url with the given body and parameters."""""" result = requests.post(url, json=body, params=parameters) return f""Status: {result.status_code} - {result.text}"" ``` ## Modify existing tools Now, we show how to load existing tools and modify them directly. In the example below, we do something really simple and change the Search tool to have the name `Google Search`. ```python from langchain.agents import load_tools ``` ```python tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm) ``` ```python tools[0].name = ""Google Search"" ``` ```python agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?"" ) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I need to find out Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend\'s name and her age. Action: Google Search Action Input: ""Leo DiCaprio girlfriend"" Observation: After rumours of a romance with Gigi Hadid, the Oscar winner has seemingly moved on.

Thought:I still need to find out his current girlfriend\'s name and her age. Action: Google Search Action Input: ""Leo DiCaprio current girlfriend age"" Observation: Leonardo DiCaprio has been linked with 19-year-old model Eden Polani, continuing the rumour that he doesn\'t date any women over the age of ... Thought:I need to find out the age of Eden Polani. Action: Calculator Action Input: 19^(0.43) Observation: Answer: 3.547023357958959 Thought:I now know the final answer. Final Answer: The age of Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend raised to the 0.43 power is approximately 3.55. > Finished chain. ""The age of Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend raised to the 0.43 power is approximately 3.55."" ``` ## Defining the priorities among Tools When you made a Custom tool, you may want the Agent to use the custom tool more than normal tools. For example, you made a custom tool, which gets information on music from your database. When a user wants information on songs, You want the Agent to use `the custom tool` more than the normal `Search tool`. But the Agent might prioritize a normal Search tool. This can be accomplished by adding a statement such as `Use this more than the normal search if the question is about Music, like \'who is the singer of yesterday?\' or \'what is the most popular song in 2022?\'` to the description. An example is below. ```python # Import things that are needed generically from langchain.agents import AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent from langchain.chains import LLMMathChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper search = SerpAPIWrapper() tools = [ Tool( name=""Search"", func=search.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", ), Tool( name=""Music Search"", func=lambda x: ""\'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey."", # Mock Function description=""A Music search engine. Use this more than the normal search if the question is about Music, like \'who is the singer of yesterday?\' or \'what is the most popular song in 2022?\'"", ), ] agent = initialize_agent( tools, OpenAI(temperature=0), agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python agent.run(""what is the most famous song of christmas"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I should use a music search engine to find the answer Action: Music Search Action Input: most famous song of christmas\'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey. I now know the final answer Final Answer: \'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey. > Finished chain. ""\'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey."" ``` ## Using tools to return directly Often, it can be desirable to have a tool output returned directly to the user, if it\'s called. You can do this easily with LangChain by setting the `return_direct` flag for a tool to be True. ```python llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm) tools = [ Tool( name=""Calculator"", func=llm_math_chain.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"", return_direct=True, ) ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run(""whats 2**.12"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I need to calculate this Action: Calculator Action Input: 2**.12Answer: 1.086734862526058 > Finished chain. \'Answer: 1.086734862526058\' ``` ## Handling Tool Errors When a tool encounters an error and the exception is not caught, the agent will stop executing. If you want the agent to continue execution, you can raise a `ToolException` and set `handle_tool_error` accordingly. When `ToolException` is thrown, the agent will not stop working, but will handle the exception according to the `handle_tool_error` variable of the tool, and the processing result will be returned to the agent as observation, and printed in red. You can set `handle_tool_error` to `True`, set it a unified string value, or set it as a function. If it\'s set as a function, the function should take a `ToolException` as a parameter and return a `str` value. Please note that only raising a `ToolException` won\'t be effective. You need to first set the `handle_tool_error` of the tool because its default value is `False`. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import Tool from langchain.tools.base import ToolException from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper def _handle_error(error: ToolException) -> str: return ( ""The following errors occurred during tool execution:"" + error.args[0] + ""Please try another tool."" ) def search_tool1(s: str): raise ToolException(""The search tool1 is not available."") def search_tool2(s: str): raise ToolException(""The search tool2 is not available."") search_tool3 = SerpAPIWrapper() ``` ```python description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events.You should give priority to using it."" tools = [ Tool.from_function( func=search_tool1, name=""Search_tool1"", description=description, handle_tool_error=True, ), Tool.from_function( func=search_tool2, name=""Search_tool2"", description=description, handle_tool_error=_handle_error, ), Tool.from_function( func=search_tool3.run, name=""Search_tool3"", description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", ), ] agent = initialize_agent( tools, ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python agent.run(""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I should use Search_tool1 to find recent news articles about Leo DiCaprio\'s personal life. Action: Search_tool1 Action Input: ""Leo DiCaprio girlfriend"" Observation: The search tool1 is not available. Thought:I should try using Search_tool2 instead. Action: Search_tool2 Action Input: ""Leo DiCaprio girlfriend"" Observation: The following errors occurred during tool execution:The search tool2 is not available.Please try another tool. Thought:I should try using Search_tool3 as a last resort. Action: Search_tool3 Action Input: ""Leo DiCaprio girlfriend"" Observation: Leonardo DiCaprio and Gigi Hadid were recently spotted at a pre-Oscars party, sparking interest once again in their rumored romance. The Revenant actor and the model first made headlines when they were spotted together at a New York Fashion Week afterparty in September 2022. Thought:Based on the information from Search_tool3, it seems that Gigi Hadid is currently rumored to be Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend.

It returns a list of results with title, url, author, and creation date. ```python search.results(""The best blog post about AI safety is definitely this: "", 10) ``` ```text [{\'title\': \'Core Views on AI Safety: When, Why, What, and How\', \'url\': \' \'author\': None, \'published_date\': \'2023-03-08\'}, {\'title\': \'Extinction Risk from Artificial Intelligence\', \'url\': \' \'author\': None, \'published_date\': \'2013-10-08\'}, {\'title\': \'The simple picture on AI safety - LessWrong\', \'url\': \' \'author\': \'Alex Flint\', \'published_date\': \'2018-05-27\'}, {\'title\': \'No Time Like The Present For AI Safety Work\', \'url\': \' \'author\': None, \'published_date\': \'2015-05-29\'}, {\'title\': \'A plea for solutionism on AI safety - LessWrong\', \'url\': \' \'author\': \'Jasoncrawford\', \'published_date\': \'2023-06-09\'}, {\'title\': \'The Artificial Intelligence Revolution: Part 1 - Wait But Why\', \'url\': \' \'author\': \'Tim Urban\', \'published_date\': \'2015-01-22\'}, {\'title\': \'Anthropic: Core Views on AI Safety: When, Why, What, and How - EA Forum\', \'url\': \' \'author\': \'Jonmenaster\', \'published_date\': \'2023-03-09\'}, {\'title\': ""[Linkpost] Sam Altman\'s 2015 Blog Posts Machine Intelligence Parts 1 & 2 - LessWrong"", \'url\': \' \'author\': \'Olivia Jimenez\', \'published_date\': \'2023-04-28\'}, {\'title\': \'The Proof of Doom - LessWrong\', \'url\': \' \'author\': \'Johnlawrenceaspden\', \'published_date\': \'2022-03-09\'}, {\'title\': ""Anthropic\'s Core Views on AI Safety - LessWrong"", \'url\': \' \'author\': \'Zac Hatfield-Dodds\', \'published_date\': \'2023-03-09\'}] ``` ### Adding filters\u200b We can also add filters to our search. include_domains: Optional[List [str] ] - List of domains to include in the search. If specified, results will only come from these domains. Only one of include_domains and exclude_domains should be specified. exclude_domains: Optional[List [str] ] - List of domains to exclude in the search. If specified, results will only come from these domains. Only one of include_domains and exclude_domains should be specified. start_crawl_date: Optional [str] - ""Crawl date"" refers to the date that Metaphor discovered a link, which is more granular and can be more useful than published date. If start_crawl_date is specified, results will only include links that were crawled after start_crawl_date. Must be specified in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) end_crawl_date: Optional [str] - ""Crawl date"" refers to the date that Metaphor discovered a link, which is more granular and can be more useful than published date. If endCrawlDate is specified, results will only include links that were crawled before end_crawl_date. Must be specified in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) start_published_date: Optional [str] - If specified, only links with a published date after start_published_date will be returned. Must be specified in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ). Note that for some links, we have no published date, and these links will be excluded from the results if start_published_date is specified. end_published_date: Optional [str] - If specified, only links with a published date before end_published_date will be returned. Must be specified in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ). Note that for some links, we have no published date, and these links will be excluded from the results if end_published_date is specified.

We will add the [ConversationBufferMemory]( class, although this can be any memory class. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` The most important step is setting up the prompt correctly. In the below prompt, we have two input keys: one for the actual input, another for the input from the Memory class. Importantly, we make sure the keys in the `PromptTemplate` and the `ConversationBufferMemory` match up (`chat_history`). ```python template = """"""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. {chat_history} Human: {human_input} Chatbot:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""chat_history"", ""human_input""], template=template ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend Chatbot: > Finished chain. \' Hi there! How can I help you today?\' ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Not too bad - how are you?"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend AI: Hi there! How can I help you today? Human: Not too bad - how are you? Chatbot: > Finished chain. "" I\'m doing great, thanks for asking! How are you doing?"" ``` ## Adding Memory to a chat model-based LLMChain The above works for completion-style `LLM`s, but if you are using a chat model, you will likely get better performance using structured chat messages. Below is an example. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, ) from langchain.schema import SystemMessage ``` We will use the [ChatPromptTemplate]( class to set up the chat prompt. The [from_messages]( method creates a `ChatPromptTemplate` from a list of messages (e.g., `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ChatMessage`, etc.) or message templates, such as the [MessagesPlaceholder]( below. The configuration below makes it so the memory will be injected to the middle of the chat prompt, in the `chat_history` key, and the user\'s inputs will be added in a human/user message to the end of the chat prompt. ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The persistent system prompt MessagesPlaceholder( variable_name=""chat_history"" ), # Where the memory will be stored. HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""{human_input}"" ), # Where the human input will injected ] ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI() chat_llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: System: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend > Finished chain. \'Hello! How can I assist you today, my friend?\' ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Not too bad - how are you?"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: System: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend AI: Hello! How can I assist you today, my friend? Human: Not too bad - how are you? > Finished chain. ""I\'m an AI chatbot, so I don\'t have feelings, but I\'m here to help and chat with you! Is there something specific you would like to talk about or any questions I can assist you with?"" ``` - [Adding Memory to a chat model-based LLMChain](#adding-memory-to-a-chat-model-based-llmchain)', 'Fallbacks | Fallbacks When working with language models, you may often encounter issues from the underlying APIs, whether these be rate limiting or downtime. Therefore, as you go to move your LLM applications into production it becomes more and more important to safeguard against these. That\'s why we\'ve introduced the concept of fallbacks. A **fallback** is an alternative plan that may be used in an emergency. Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. This is important because often times different models require different prompts. So if your call to OpenAI fails, you don\'t just want to send the same prompt to Anthropic - you probably want to use a different prompt template and send a different version there. ## Fallback for LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things. Therefore, using fallbacks can help protect against these types of things. IMPORTANT: By default, a lot of the LLM wrappers catch errors and retry. You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying and not failing. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI ``` First, let\'s mock out what happens if we hit a RateLimitError from OpenAI ```python from unittest.mock import patch from openai.error import RateLimitError ``` ```python # Note that we set max_retries = 0 to avoid retrying on RateLimits, etc openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0) anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic() llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm]) ``` ```python # Let\'s use just the OpenAI LLm first, to show that we run into an error with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(openai_llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ```python # Now let\'s try with fallbacks to Anthropic with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content=\' I don\\\'t actually know why the chicken crossed the road, but here are some possible humorous answers:\\n\\n- To get to the other side!\\n\\n- It was too chicken to just stand there. \\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\n- It wanted to show the possum it could be done.\\n\\n- It was on its way to a poultry farmers\\\' convention.\\n\\nThe joke plays on the double meaning of ""the other side"" - literally crossing the road to the other side, or the ""other side"" meaning the afterlife. So it\\\'s an anti-joke, with a silly or unexpected pun as the answer.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` We can use our ""LLM with Fallbacks"" as we would a normal LLM. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content="" I don\'t actually know why the kangaroo crossed the road, but I can take a guess! Here are some possible reasons:\\n\\n- To get to the other side (the classic joke answer!)\\n\\n- It was trying to find some food or water \\n\\n- It was trying to find a mate during mating season\\n\\n- It was fleeing from a predator or perceived threat\\n\\n- It was disoriented and crossed accidentally \\n\\n- It was following a herd of other kangaroos who were crossing\\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery or environment \\n\\n- It was trying to reach a new habitat or territory\\n\\nThe real reason is unknown without more context, but hopefully one of those potential explanations does the joke justice! Let me know if you have any other animal jokes I can try to decipher."" additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback for Sequences We can also create fallbacks for sequences, that are sequences themselves. Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model). Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt. ```python # First let\'s create a chain with a ChatModel # We add in a string output parser here so the outputs between the two are the same type from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) # Here we\'re going to use a bad model name to easily create a chain that will error chat_model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"") bad_chain = chat_prompt | chat_model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python # Now lets create a chain with the normal OpenAI model from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = """"""Instructions: You should always include a compliment in your response. Question: Why did the {animal} cross the road?"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template) llm = OpenAI() good_chain = prompt | llm ``` ```python # We can now create a final chain which combines the two chain = bad_chain.with_fallbacks([good_chain]) chain.invoke({""animal"": ""turtle""}) ``` ```text \'\\n\\nAnswer: The turtle crossed the road to get to the other side, and I have to say he had some impressive determination.\' ``` ## Fallback for Long Inputs One of the big limiting factors of LLMs is their context window. Usually, you can count and track the length of prompts before sending them to an LLM, but in situations where that is hard/complicated, you can fallback to a model with a longer context length. ```python short_llm = ChatOpenAI() long_llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"") llm = short_llm.with_fallbacks([long_llm]) ``` ```python inputs = ""What is the next number: "" + "", "".join([""one"", ""two""] * 3000) ``` ```python try: print(short_llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text This model\'s maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 12012 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages. ``` ```python try: print(llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text content=\'The next number in the sequence is two.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback to Better Model Often times we ask models to output format in a specific format (like JSON). Models like GPT-3.5 can do this okay, but sometimes struggle. This naturally points to fallbacks - we can try with GPT-3.5 (faster, cheaper), but then if parsing fails we can use GPT-4. ```python from langchain.output_parsers import DatetimeOutputParser ``` ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template( ""what time was {event} (in %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ format - only return this value)"" ) ``` ```python # In this case we are going to do the fallbacks on the LLM + output parser level # Because the error will get raised in the OutputParser openai_35 = ChatOpenAI() | DatetimeOutputParser() openai_4 = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"") | DatetimeOutputParser() ``` ```python only_35 = prompt | openai_35 fallback_4 = prompt | openai_35.with_fallbacks([openai_4]) ``` ```python try: print(only_35.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text Error: Could not parse datetime string: The Super Bowl in 1994 took place on January 30th at 3:30 PM local time. Converting this to the specified format (%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ) results in: 1994-01-30T15:30:00.000Z ``` ```python try: print(fallback_4.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text 1994-01-30 15:30:00 ``` - [Fallback for LLM API Errors](#fallback-for-llm-api-errors) - [Fallback for Sequences](#fallback-for-sequences) - [Fallback for Long Inputs](#fallback-for-long-inputs) - [Fallback to Better Model](#fallback-to-better-model)']","To handle rate limiting with a backup model in your application, you can set up fallbacks in your language model calls. Here's an example using Python and the `langchain` library:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI
from unittest.mock import patch

# Initialize the primary and fallback models
openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0)  # Set max_retries to 0 to avoid automatic retries
anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic()

# Create a model with fallbacks
llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm])

# Mock a rate limiting error from the primary model
with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=Exception(""Rate limit error"")):
    try:
        response = llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f""Hit error: {e}"")

# The fallback model should now be used
```

In this example, if the primary `ChatOpenAI` model encounters an error (simulated here as a rate limit error), the application will automatically switch to the `ChatAnthropic` model as a fallback. This ensures that your application can continue to function even when the primary model is temporarily unavailable due to rate limiting.","A straightforward way to do this is to specify fallback models using LangChain Expression Language. Example below:
```python     
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

bad_llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"")
good_llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"")
llm = bad_llm.with_fallbacks([good_llm])
llm.invoke(""Why did the the chicken cross the road?"")

22,I'm runing my own model using vllm. How do I connect it to LangChain?,"['Memory in LLMChain | Memory in LLMChain This notebook goes over how to use the Memory class with an `LLMChain`. We will add the [ConversationBufferMemory]( class, although this can be any memory class. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` The most important step is setting up the prompt correctly. In the below prompt, we have two input keys: one for the actual input, another for the input from the Memory class. Importantly, we make sure the keys in the `PromptTemplate` and the `ConversationBufferMemory` match up (`chat_history`). ```python template = """"""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. {chat_history} Human: {human_input} Chatbot:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""chat_history"", ""human_input""], template=template ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend Chatbot: > Finished chain. \' Hi there! How can I help you today?\' ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Not too bad - how are you?"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend AI: Hi there! How can I help you today? Human: Not too bad - how are you? Chatbot: > Finished chain. "" I\'m doing great, thanks for asking! How are you doing?"" ``` ## Adding Memory to a chat model-based LLMChain The above works for completion-style `LLM`s, but if you are using a chat model, you will likely get better performance using structured chat messages. Below is an example. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, ) from langchain.schema import SystemMessage ``` We will use the [ChatPromptTemplate]( class to set up the chat prompt. The [from_messages]( method creates a `ChatPromptTemplate` from a list of messages (e.g., `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ChatMessage`, etc.) or message templates, such as the [MessagesPlaceholder]( below. The configuration below makes it so the memory will be injected to the middle of the chat prompt, in the `chat_history` key, and the user\'s inputs will be added in a human/user message to the end of the chat prompt. ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The persistent system prompt MessagesPlaceholder( variable_name=""chat_history"" ), # Where the memory will be stored. HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""{human_input}"" ), # Where the human input will injected ] ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI() chat_llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: System: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend > Finished chain. \'Hello! How can I assist you today, my friend?\' ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Not too bad - how are you?"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: System: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend AI: Hello! How can I assist you today, my friend? Human: Not too bad - how are you? > Finished chain. ""I\'m an AI chatbot, so I don\'t have feelings, but I\'m here to help and chat with you!

If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved. I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now. It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue it\'s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables.

I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue.

I\'m a large language model, which means I\'m trained on a large corpus of text data to generate language outputs that are coherent and natural-sounding. My architecture is based on a transformer model, which is a type of neural network that\'s particularly well-suited for natural language processing tasks. As for my parameters, I have a few billion parameters, but I don\'t have access to the exact number as it\'s not relevant to my functioning. My training data includes a vast amount of text from various sources, including books, articles, and websites, which I use to learn patterns and relationships in language. I\'m designed to be a helpful tool for a variety of tasks, such as answering questions, providing information, and generating text. I\'m constantly learning and improving my abilities through machine learning algorithms and feedback from users like you. I hope this helps! Is there anything else you\'d like to know about me or my capabilities? --- meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf Ah, a fellow tech enthusiast! *adjusts glasses* I\'m glad to share some technical details about myself. Indeed, I\'m a transformer model, specifically a BERT-like language model trained on a large corpus of text data. My architecture is based on the transformer framework, which is a type of neural network designed for natural language processing tasks. As for the number of parameters, I have approximately 340 million. *winks* That\'s a pretty hefty number, if I do say so myself! These parameters allow me to learn and represent complex patterns in language, such as syntax, semantics, and more. But don\'t ask me to do math in my head I\'m a language model, not a calculating machine! My strengths lie in understanding and generating human-like text, so feel free to chat with me anytime you\'d like. Now, do you have any more technical questions for me? Or would you like to engage in a nice chat? --- meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf Hello! As a friendly and helpful AI, I\'d be happy to share some technical facts about myself. I am a transformer-based language model, specifically a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. BERT was developed by Google in 2018 and has since become one of the most popular and widely-used AI language models. Here are some technical details about my capabilities: 1. Parameters: I have approximately 340 million parameters, which are the numbers that I use to learn and represent language. This is a relatively large number of parameters compared to some other languages models, but it allows me to learn and understand complex language patterns and relationships. 2. Training: I was trained on a large corpus of text data, including books, articles, and other sources of written content. This training allows me to learn about the structure and conventions of language, as well as the relationships between words and phrases. 3. Architectures: My architecture is based on the transformer model, which is a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for natural language processing tasks. The transformer model uses self-attention mechanisms to allow the model to ""attend"" to different parts of the input text, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships. 4. Precision: I am capable of generating text with high precision and accuracy, meaning that I can produce text that is close to human-level quality in terms of grammar, syntax, and coherence. 5. Generative capabilities: In addition to being able to generate text based on prompts and questions, I am also capable of generating text based on a given topic or theme. This allows me to create longer, more coherent pieces of text that are organized around a specific idea or concept. Overall, I am a powerful and versatile language model that is capable of a wide range of natural language processing tasks. I am constantly learning and improving, and I am here to help answer any questions you may have! --- CPU times: user 371 ms, sys: 15.5 ms, total: 387 ms Wall time: 12 s ```', 'Facebook Messenger | Facebook Messenger This notebook shows how to load data from Facebook in a format you can fine-tune on. The overall steps are: 1. Download your messenger data to disk. 2. Create the Chat Loader and call `loader.load()` (or `loader.lazy_load()`) to perform the conversion. 3. Optionally use `merge_chat_runs` to combine message from the same sender in sequence, and/or `map_ai_messages` to convert messages from the specified sender to the ""AIMessage"" class. Once you\'ve done this, call `convert_messages_for_finetuning` to prepare your data for fine-tuning. Once this has been done, you can fine-tune your model. To do so you would complete the following steps: 1. Upload your messages to OpenAI and run a fine-tuning job. 2. Use the resulting model in your LangChain app! Let\'s begin. ## 1. Download Data To download your own messenger data, following instructions [here]( IMPORTANT - make sure to download them in JSON format (not HTML). We are hosting an example dump at [this google drive link]( that we will use in this walkthrough. ```python # This uses some example data import zipfile import requests def download_and_unzip(url: str, output_path: str = ""file.zip"") -> None: file_id = url.split(""/"")[-2] download_url = f"" response = requests.get(download_url) if response.status_code != 200: print(""Failed to download the file."") return with open(output_path, ""wb"") as file: file.write(response.content) print(f""File {output_path} downloaded."") with zipfile.ZipFile(output_path, ""r"") as zip_ref: zip_ref.extractall() print(f""File {output_path} has been unzipped."") # URL of the file to download url = ( "" ) # Download and unzip download_and_unzip(url) ``` ```text File file.zip downloaded. File file.zip has been unzipped. ``` ## 2. Create Chat Loader We have 2 different `FacebookMessengerChatLoader` classes, one for an entire directory of chats, and one to load individual files. We ```python directory_path = ""./hogwarts"" ``` ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.facebook_messenger import ( FolderFacebookMessengerChatLoader, SingleFileFacebookMessengerChatLoader, ) ``` ```python loader = SingleFileFacebookMessengerChatLoader( path=""./hogwarts/inbox/HermioneGranger/messages_Hermione_Granger.json"", ) ``` ```python chat_session = loader.load()[0] chat_session[""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=""Hi Hermione! How\'s your summer going so far?"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""Harry! Lovely to hear from you. My summer is going well, though I do miss everyone. I\'m spending most of my time going through my books and researching fascinating new topics. How about you?"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Hermione Granger\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""I miss you all too. The Dursleys are being their usual unpleasant selves but I\'m getting by. At least I can practice some spells in my room without them knowing. Let me know if you find anything good in your researching!"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False)] ``` ```python loader = FolderFacebookMessengerChatLoader( path=""./hogwarts"", ) ``` ```python chat_sessions = loader.load() len(chat_sessions) ``` ```text 9 ``` ## 3. Prepare for fine-tuning Calling `load()` returns all the chat messages we could extract as human messages. When conversing with chat bots, conversations typically follow a more strict alternating dialogue pattern relative to real conversations. You can choose to merge message ""runs"" (consecutive messages from the same sender) and select a sender to represent the ""AI"". The fine-tuned LLM will learn to generate these AI messages. ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.utils import ( map_ai_messages, merge_chat_runs, ) ``` ```python merged_sessions = merge_chat_runs(chat_sessions) alternating_sessions = list(map_ai_messages(merged_sessions, ""Harry Potter"")) ``` ```python # Now all of Harry Potter\'s messages will take the AI message class # which maps to the \'assistant\' role in OpenAI\'s training format alternating_sessions[0][""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [AIMessage(content=""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""What is it, Potter? I\'m quite busy at the moment."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Severus Snape\'}, example=False), AIMessage(content=""I apologize for the interruption, sir. I\'ll be brief. I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False)] ``` #### Now we can convert to OpenAI format dictionaries ```python from langchain.adapters.openai import convert_messages_for_finetuning ``` ```python training_data = convert_messages_for_finetuning(alternating_sessions) print(f""Prepared {len(training_data)} dialogues for training"") ``` ```text Prepared 9 dialogues for training ``` ```python training_data[0][:3] ``` ```text [{\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately.""}, {\'role\': \'user\', \'content\': ""What is it, Potter? I\'m quite busy at the moment.""}, {\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""I apologize for the interruption, sir. I\'ll be brief. I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister.""}] ``` OpenAI currently requires at least 10 training examples for a fine-tuning job, though they recommend between 50-100 for most tasks. Since we only have 9 chat sessions, we can subdivide them (optionally with some overlap) so that each training example is comprised of a portion of a whole conversation. Facebook chat sessions (1 per person) often span multiple days and conversations, so the long-range dependencies may not be that important to model anyhow. ```python # Our chat is alternating, we will make each datapoint a group of 8 messages, # with 2 messages overlapping chunk_size = 8 overlap = 2 training_examples = [ conversation_messages[i : i + chunk_size] for conversation_messages in training_data for i in range(0, len(conversation_messages) - chunk_size + 1, chunk_size - overlap) ] len(training_examples) ``` ```text 100 ``` ## 4. Fine-tune the model It\'s time to fine-tune the model. Make sure you have `openai` installed and have set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` appropriately ```python # %pip install -U openai --quiet ``` ```python import json import time from io import BytesIO import openai # We will write the jsonl file in memory my_file = BytesIO() for m in training_examples: my_file.write((json.dumps({""messages"": m}) + ""\\n"").encode(""utf-8"")) my_file.seek(0) training_file = openai.File.create(file=my_file, purpose=""fine-tune"") # OpenAI audits each training file for compliance reasons. # This make take a few minutes status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""processed"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status print(f""File {training_file.id} ready after {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds."") ``` ```text File file-zCyNBeg4snpbBL7VkvsuhCz8 ready afer 30.55 seconds. ``` With the file ready, it\'s time to kick off a training job. ```python job = openai.FineTuningJob.create( training_file=training_file.id, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) ``` Grab a cup of tea while your model is being prepared. This may take some time! ```python status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""succeeded"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) job = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id) status = job.status ``` ```text Status=[running]... 908.87s ``` ```python print(job.fine_tuned_model) ``` ```text ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::7rDwkaOq ``` ## 5. Use in LangChain You can use the resulting model ID directly the `ChatOpenAI` model class. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI model = ChatOpenAI( model=job.fine_tuned_model, temperature=1, ) ``` ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) chain = prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python for tok in chain.stream({""input"": ""What classes are you taking?""}): print(tok, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text The usual - Potions, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts.

However, I can offer a general approach on how you might connect your own model to LangChain:

1. **Check LangChain Documentation**: Review the official LangChain documentation for guidelines on adding custom models. LangChain often supports custom LLMs through specific interfaces.

2. **Implement Required Interface**: Ensure your VLLM model adheres to the interface expected by LangChain. This typically involves implementing methods for text generation, tokenization, and model loading.

3. **Create a Custom Model Class**: Develop a custom model class in LangChain that wraps your VLLM model. This class should implement the necessary methods from LangChain’s model interface.

4. **Test Integration**: Thoroughly test the integration to ensure that your model works seamlessly within the LangChain framework.

For precise and detailed steps, I recommend consulting the LangChain GitHub repository or reaching out to their support channels. They can provide the most accurate and up-to-date guidance tailored to your specific use case.","LangChain has a VLLM integration:""

Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`.

The main difference here is a different prompt. We will use JSON to encode the agent\'s actions (chat models are a bit tougher to steet, so using JSON helps to enforce the output format). ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python chat_model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python prompt = hub.pull(""hwchase17/react-json"") prompt = prompt.partial( tools=render_text_description(tools), tool_names="", "".join([t.name for t in tools]), ) ``` ```python chat_model_with_stop = chat_model.bind(stop=[""\\nObservation""]) ``` ```python from langchain.agents.output_parsers import ReActJsonSingleInputOutputParser ``` ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_log_to_str(x[""intermediate_steps""]), } | prompt | chat_model_with_stop | ReActJsonSingleInputOutputParser() ) ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` ```python agent_executor.invoke( { ""input"": ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?

What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?"" ) ``` - [Using LCEL](#using-lcel) - [Using ZeroShotReactAgent](#using-zeroshotreactagent) - [Using chat models](#using-chat-models)', 'Router | Router Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. As a very simple example, let\'s suppose we have two templates optimized for different types of questions, and we want to choose the template based on the user input. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate physics_template = """"""You are a very smart physics professor. \\ You are great at answering questions about physics in a concise and easy to understand manner. \\ When you don\'t know the answer to a question you admit that you don\'t know.

A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch ``` ```python general_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a helpful assistant.

Router chains are made up of two components: - The `RouterChain` itself (responsible for selecting the next chain to call) - `destination_chains`: chains that the router chain can route to In this example, we will focus on the different types of routing chains. We will show these routing chains used in a `MultiPromptChain` to create a question-answering chain that selects the prompt which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using that prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.chains.router import MultiPromptChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` ### [Legacy] LLMRouterChain This chain uses an LLM to determine how to route things. ```python prompt_infos = [ { ""name"": ""physics"", ""description"": ""Good for answering questions about physics"", ""prompt_template"": physics_template, }, { ""name"": ""math"", ""description"": ""Good for answering math questions"", ""prompt_template"": math_template, }, ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() ``` ```python destination_chains = {} for p_info in prompt_infos: name = p_info[""name""] prompt_template = p_info[""prompt_template""] prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=[""input""]) chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) destination_chains[name] = chain default_chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, output_key=""text"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains.router.llm_router import LLMRouterChain, RouterOutputParser from langchain.chains.router.multi_prompt_prompt import MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE ``` ```python destinations = [f""{p[\'name\']}: {p[\'description\']}"" for p in prompt_infos] destinations_str = ""\\n"".join(destinations) router_template = MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE.format(destinations=destinations_str) router_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=router_template, input_variables=[""input""], output_parser=RouterOutputParser(), ) router_chain = LLMRouterChain.from_llm(llm, router_prompt) ``` ```python chain = MultiPromptChain( router_chain=router_chain, destination_chains=destination_chains, default_chain=default_chain, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is black body radiation?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is black body radiation?\'} > Finished chain.

The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43. This can be seen by breaking down the problem: 1) We know that a prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and one. 2) We also know that if a number is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. So, if we want to find the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3, we can start counting up from 40, testing each number to see if it is prime and if the sum of the number and one is divisible by three. The first number we come to that satisfies these conditions is 43. ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?\'} > Finished chain.

The prompt itself 3. The model, complete with stop tokens if needed 4.

The recommended way to do this is using LangChain Expression Language. We also continue to support the legacy `LLMChain`, which is a single class for composing these three components. ## Using LCEL `BasePromptTemplate`, `BaseLanguageModel` and `BaseOutputParser` all implement the `Runnable` interface and are designed to be piped into one another, making LCEL composition very easy: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"" ) runnable = prompt | ChatOpenAI() | StrOutputParser() runnable.invoke({""product"": ""colorful socks""}) ``` ```text \'VibrantSocks\' ``` Head to the [LCEL](/docs/expression_language) section for more on the interface, built-in features, and cookbook examples. ## [Legacy] LLMChain This is a legacy class, using LCEL as shown above is preffered.An `LLMChain` is a simple chain that adds some functionality around language models. It is used widely throughout LangChain, including in other chains and agents. An `LLMChain` consists of a `PromptTemplate` and a language model (either an LLM or chat model). It formats the prompt template using the input key values provided (and also memory key values, if available), passes the formatted string to LLM and returns the LLM output. ### Get started ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = ""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"" llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template)) llm_chain(""colorful socks"") ``` ```text {\'product\': \'colorful socks\', \'text\': \'\\n\\nSocktastic!\'} ``` ### Additional ways of running LLMChain Aside from `__call__` and `run` methods shared by all `Chain` object, `LLMChain` offers a few more ways of calling the chain logic: - `apply` allows you run the chain against a list of inputs: ```python input_list = [{""product"": ""socks""}, {""product"": ""computer""}, {""product"": ""shoes""}] llm_chain.apply(input_list) ``` ```text [{\'text\': \'\\n\\nSocktastic!\'}, {\'text\': \'\\n\\nTechCore Solutions.\'}, {\'text\': \'\\n\\nFootwear Factory.\'}] ``` - `generate` is similar to `apply`, except it return an `LLMResult` instead of string. `LLMResult` often contains useful generation such as token usages and finish reason. ```python llm_chain.generate(input_list) ``` ```text LLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text=\'\\n\\nSocktastic!\', generation_info={\'finish_reason\': \'stop\', \'logprobs\': None})], [Generation(text=\'\\n\\nTechCore Solutions.\', generation_info={\'finish_reason\': \'stop\', \'logprobs\': None})], [Generation(text=\'\\n\\nFootwear Factory.\', generation_info={\'finish_reason\': \'stop\', \'logprobs\': None})]], llm_output={\'token_usage\': {\'completion_tokens\': 19, \'prompt_tokens\': 36, \'total_tokens\': 55}, \'model_name\': \'text-davinci-003\'}, run=[RunInfo(run_id=UUID(\'9a423a43-6d35-4e8f-9aca-cacfc8e0dc49\')), RunInfo(run_id=UUID(\'a879c077-b521-461c-8f29-ba63adfc327c\')), RunInfo(run_id=UUID(\'40b892fa-e8c2-47d0-a309-4f7a4ed5b64a\'))]) ``` - `predict` is similar to `run` method except that the input keys are specified as keyword arguments instead of a Python dict. ```python # Single input example llm_chain.predict(product=""colorful socks"") ``` ```text \'\\n\\nSocktastic!\' ``` ```python # Multiple inputs example template = """"""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {subject}."""""" prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[""adjective"", ""subject""]) llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=OpenAI(temperature=0)) llm_chain.predict(adjective=""sad"", subject=""ducks"") ``` ```text \'\\n\\nQ: What did the duck say when his friend died?\\nA: Quack, quack, goodbye.\' ``` ### Parsing the outputs By default, `LLMChain` does not parse the output even if the underlying `prompt` object has an output parser. If you would like to apply that output parser on the LLM output, use `predict_and_parse` instead of `predict` and `apply_and_parse` instead of `apply`. With `predict`: ```python from langchain.output_parsers import CommaSeparatedListOutputParser output_parser = CommaSeparatedListOutputParser() template = """"""List all the colors in a rainbow"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( template=template, input_variables=[], output_parser=output_parser ) llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm) llm_chain.predict() ``` ```text \'\\n\\nRed, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet\' ``` With `predict_and_parse`: ```python llm_chain.predict_and_parse() ``` ```text /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( [\'Red\', \'orange\', \'yellow\', \'green\', \'blue\', \'indigo\', \'violet\'] ``` ### Initialize from string You can also construct an `LLMChain` from a string template directly. ```python template = """"""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {subject}."""""" llm_chain = LLMChain.from_string(llm=llm, template=template) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(adjective=""sad"", subject=""ducks"") ``` ```text \'\\n\\nQ: What did the duck say when his friend died?\\nA: Quack, quack, goodbye.\' ``` - [Using LCEL](#using-lcel) - [Legacy LLMChain](#legacy-llmchain)', 'vLLM | vLLM [vLLM]( is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving, offering: - State-of-the-art serving throughput - Efficient management of attention key and value memory with PagedAttention - Continuous batching of incoming requests - Optimized CUDA kernels This notebooks goes over how to use a LLM with langchain and vLLM.

There does not appear to be solid consensus on how best to do few-shot prompting, and the optimal prompt compilation will likely vary by model. Because of this, we provide few-shot prompt templates like the [FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate]( as a flexible starting point, and you can modify or replace them as you see fit. The goal of few-shot prompt templates are to dynamically select examples based on an input, and then format the examples in a final prompt to provide for the model. **Note:** The following code examples are for chat models. For similar few-shot prompt examples for completion models (LLMs), see the [few-shot prompt templates](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/few_shot_examples) guide. ### Fixed Examples The most basic (and common) few-shot prompting technique is to use a fixed prompt example. This way you can select a chain, evaluate it, and avoid worrying about additional moving parts in production. The basic components of the template are: - `examples`: A list of dictionary examples to include in the final prompt. - `example_prompt`: converts each example into 1 or more messages through its [format_messages]( method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message. Below is a simple demonstration. First, import the modules for this example: ```python from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate, ) ``` Then, define the examples you\'d like to include. ```python examples = [ {""input"": ""2+2"", ""output"": ""4""}, {""input"": ""2+3"", ""output"": ""5""}, ] ``` Next, assemble them into the few-shot prompt template. ```python # This is a prompt template used to format each individual example. example_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""human"", ""{input}""), (""ai"", ""{output}""), ] ) few_shot_prompt = FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate( example_prompt=example_prompt, examples=examples, ) print(few_shot_prompt.format()) ``` ```text Human: 2+2 AI: 4 Human: 2+3 AI: 5 ``` Finally, assemble your final prompt and use it with a model. ```python final_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a wondrous wizard of math.""), few_shot_prompt, (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic chain = final_prompt | ChatAnthropic(temperature=0.0) chain.invoke({""input"": ""What\'s the square of a triangle?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\' Triangles do not have a ""square"". A square refers to a shape with 4 equal sides and 4 right angles. Triangles have 3 sides and 3 angles.\\n\\nThe area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:\\n\\nA = 1/2 * b * h\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\nA is the area \\nb is the base (the length of one of the sides)\\nh is the height (the length from the base to the opposite vertex)\\n\\nSo the area depends on the specific dimensions of the triangle. There is no single ""square of a triangle"". The area can vary greatly depending on the base and height measurements.\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` ## Dynamic few-shot prompting Sometimes you may want to condition which examples are shown based on the input. For this, you can replace the `examples` with an `example_selector`. The other components remain the same as above! To review, the dynamic few-shot prompt template would look like: - `example_selector`: responsible for selecting few-shot examples (and the order in which they are returned) for a given input. These implement the [BaseExampleSelector]( interface. A common example is the vectorstore-backed [SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector]( - `example_prompt`: convert each example into 1 or more messages through its [format_messages]( method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message. These once again can be composed with other messages and chat templates to assemble your final prompt. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.prompts import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` Since we are using a vectorstore to select examples based on semantic similarity, we will want to first populate the store. ```python examples = [ {""input"": ""2+2"", ""output"": ""4""}, {""input"": ""2+3"", ""output"": ""5""}, {""input"": ""2+4"", ""output"": ""6""}, {""input"": ""What did the cow say to the moon?"", ""output"": ""nothing at all""}, { ""input"": ""Write me a poem about the moon"", ""output"": ""One for the moon, and one for me, who are we to talk about the moon?"", }, ] to_vectorize = ["" "".join(example.values()) for example in examples] embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectorstore = Chroma.from_texts(to_vectorize, embeddings, metadatas=examples) ``` #### Create the example_selector With a vectorstore created, you can create the `example_selector`. Here we will isntruct it to only fetch the top 2 examples. ```python example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector( vectorstore=vectorstore, k=2, ) # The prompt template will load examples by passing the input do the `select_examples` method example_selector.select_examples({""input"": ""horse""}) ``` ```text [{\'input\': \'What did the cow say to the moon?\', \'output\': \'nothing at all\'}, {\'input\': \'2+4\', \'output\': \'6\'}] ``` #### Create prompt template Assemble the prompt template, using the `example_selector` created above. ```python from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate, ) # Define the few-shot prompt. few_shot_prompt = FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate( # The input variables select the values to pass to the example_selector input_variables=[""input""], example_selector=example_selector, # Define how each example will be formatted. # In this case, each example will become 2 messages: # 1 human, and 1 AI example_prompt=ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [(""human"", ""{input}""), (""ai"", ""{output}"")] ), ) ``` Below is an example of how this would be assembled. ```python print(few_shot_prompt.format(input=""What\'s 3+3?"")) ``` ```text Human: 2+3 AI: 5 Human: 2+2 AI: 4 ``` Assemble the final prompt template: ```python final_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a wondrous wizard of math.""), few_shot_prompt, (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) ``` ```python print(few_shot_prompt.format(input=""What\'s 3+3?"")) ``` ```text Human: 2+3 AI: 5 Human: 2+2 AI: 4 ``` #### Use with an LLM Now, you can connect your model to the few-shot prompt. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic chain = final_prompt | ChatAnthropic(temperature=0.0) chain.invoke({""input"": ""What\'s 3+3?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\' 3 + 3 = 6\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` - [Fixed Examples](#fixed-examples) - [Dynamic few-shot prompting](#dynamic-few-shot-prompting)', 'Custom prompt template | Custom prompt template Let\'s suppose we want the LLM to generate English language explanations of a function given its name. To achieve this task, we will create a custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input, and formats the prompt template to provide the source code of the function. ## Why are custom prompt templates needed? LangChain provides a set of [default prompt templates](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/) that can be used to generate prompts for a variety of tasks. However, there may be cases where the default prompt templates do not meet your needs. For example, you may want to create a prompt template with specific dynamic instructions for your language model. In such cases, you can create a custom prompt template. ## Creating a custom prompt template There are essentially two distinct prompt templates available - string prompt templates and chat prompt templates. String prompt templates provides a simple prompt in string format, while chat prompt templates produces a more structured prompt to be used with a chat API. In this guide, we will create a custom prompt using a string prompt template. To create a custom string prompt template, there are two requirements: 1. It has an input_variables attribute that exposes what input variables the prompt template expects. 2. It defines a format method that takes in keyword arguments corresponding to the expected input_variables and returns the formatted prompt. We will create a custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input and formats the prompt to provide the source code of the function. To achieve this, let\'s first create a function that will return the source code of a function given its name. ```python import inspect def get_source_code(function_name): # Get the source code of the function return inspect.getsource(function_name) ``` Next, we\'ll create a custom prompt template that takes in the function name as input, and formats the prompt template to provide the source code of the function. ```python from langchain.prompts import StringPromptTemplate from pydantic import BaseModel, validator PROMPT = """"""\\ Given the function name and source code, generate an English language explanation of the function.

It keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, but rather than just completely flushing old interactions it compiles them into a summary and uses both.

The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1. Simple prompting: Agents can use Language Model based prompting to break down tasks into subgoals. For example, by providing prompts like ""Steps for XYZ"" or ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", the agent can generate a sequence of smaller steps that lead to the completion of the overall task.\\n\\n2. Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to ""Write a story outline."" This provides a high-level structure for the task and helps in breaking it down into smaller components.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Agents can also take inputs from humans to decompose tasks. This can be done through direct communication or by leveraging human expertise. Humans can provide guidance and insights to help the agent break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals.\\n\\nOverall, task decomposition allows agents to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals, enabling them to plan and execute complex tasks efficiently.\'} ``` ```python qa(""What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'The human asks how agents use task decomposition.

Long-Term Memory Management: This involves storing and organizing information in a long-term memory system. The agent can retrieve past experiences, knowledge, and learned strategies to guide the task decomposition process.\\n\\n2. Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents. This allows for easy retrieval and reference during the execution of the task.\\n\\nThese memory resources help the agent in organizing and managing information, making informed decisions, and effectively decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals.\'} ``` Again, we can use the [LangSmith trace]( to explore the prompt structure. ### Going deeper - Agents, such as the [conversational retrieval agent](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents), can be used for retrieval when necessary while also holding a conversation. - [Use case](#use-case) - [Overview](#overview) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Memory](#memory) - [Conversation](#conversation) - [Chat Retrieval](#chat-retrieval)- [Going deeper](#going-deeper)', 'Token counting | Token counting LangChain offers a context manager that allows you to count tokens. ```python import asyncio from langchain.callbacks import get_openai_callback from langchain.llms import OpenAI llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) with get_openai_callback() as cb: llm(""What is the square root of 4?"") total_tokens = cb.total_tokens assert total_tokens > 0 with get_openai_callback() as cb: llm(""What is the square root of 4?"") llm(""What is the square root of 4?"") assert cb.total_tokens == total_tokens * 2 # You can kick off concurrent runs from within the context manager with get_openai_callback() as cb: await asyncio.gather( *[llm.agenerate([""What is the square root of 4?""]) for _ in range(3)] ) assert cb.total_tokens == total_tokens * 3 # The context manager is concurrency safe task = asyncio.create_task(llm.agenerate([""What is the square root of 4?""])) with get_openai_callback() as cb: await llm.agenerate([""What is the square root of 4?""]) await task assert cb.total_tokens == total_tokens ```', 'Model comparison | Model comparison Constructing your language model application will likely involved choosing between many different options of prompts, models, and even chains to use.

For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.\\nGetting Started\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\nGetting Started Documentation\\nModules\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\nModels: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\nUse Cases\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\nPersonal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\\nQuestion Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\nInteracting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\\nExtraction: Extract structured information from text.\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nReference Docs\\nAll of LangChain\'s reference documentation, in one place.

This allows us to use the embeddings to do semantic retrieval / search. We can find a few closest embeddings in the documents embeddings based on the cosine similarity, and retrieve the corresponding document using the `KNNRetriever` class from LangChain. ```python from langchain.retrievers import KNNRetriever retriever = KNNRetriever.from_texts(documents, embeddings) # retrieve the most relevant documents result = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) top1_retrieved_doc = result[0].page_content # return the top1 retrieved result print(top1_retrieved_doc) ``` ```text An LLMChain is a chain that composes basic LLM functionality.

The Embeddings class is a class designed for interfacing with text embedding models. There are lots of embedding model providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - this class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them. Embeddings create a vector representation of a piece of text. This is useful because it means we can think about text in the vector space, and do things like semantic search where we look for pieces of text that are most similar in the vector space. The base Embeddings class in LangChain provides two methods: one for embedding documents and one for embedding a query. The former takes as input multiple texts, while the latter takes a single text. The reason for having these as two separate methods is that some embedding providers have different embedding methods for documents (to be searched over) vs queries (the search query itself). ## Get started ### Setup To start we\'ll need to install the OpenAI Python package: ```bash pip install openai ``` Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading [here]( Once we have a key we\'ll want to set it as an environment variable by running: ```bash export OPENAI_API_KEY=""..."" ``` If you\'d prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the `openai_api_key` named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class: ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=""..."") ``` Otherwise you can initialize without any params: ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ### embed_documents #### Embed list of texts ```python embeddings = embeddings_model.embed_documents( [ ""Hi there!"", ""Oh, hello!"", ""What\'s your name?"", ""My friends call me World"", ""Hello World!"" ] ) len(embeddings), len(embeddings[0]) ``` ```text (5, 1536) ``` ### embed_query #### Embed single query Embed a single piece of text for the purpose of comparing to other embedded pieces of texts. ```python embedded_query = embeddings_model.embed_query(""What was the name mentioned in the conversation?"") embedded_query[:5] ``` ```text [0.0053587136790156364, -0.0004999046213924885, 0.038883671164512634, -0.003001077566295862, -0.00900818221271038] ``` - [Get started](#get-started)- [Setup](#setup) - [embed_documents](#embed_documents) - [embed_query](#embed_query)', 'Helicone | Helicone This page covers how to use the [Helicone]( ecosystem within LangChain. ## What is Helicone?

Note that because of certain interfaces, it\'s often easier to construct the chain first, and then edit the LLM afterwards. As an example, we will load a summarizer map-reduce chain. We will cache results for the map-step, but then not freeze it for the combine step. ```python llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"") no_cache_llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", cache=False) ``` ```python from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.chains.mapreduce import MapReduceChain text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter() ``` ```python with open(\'../../../state_of_the_union.txt\') as f: state_of_the_union = f.read() texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union) ``` ```python from langchain.docstore.document import Document docs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts[:3]] from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain ``` ```python chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"", reduce_llm=no_cache_llm) ``` ```python chain.run(docs) ``` ```text CPU times: user 452 ms, sys: 60.3 ms, total: 512 ms Wall time: 5.09 s \'\\n\\nPresident Biden is discussing the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will create jobs and help Americans.

But, retrieval may produce different results with subtle changes in query wording or if the embeddings do not capture the semantics of the data well. Prompt engineering / tuning is sometimes done to manually address these problems, but can be tedious. The `MultiQueryRetriever` automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents. By generating multiple perspectives on the same question, the `MultiQueryRetriever` might be able to overcome some of the limitations of the distance-based retrieval and get a richer set of results. ```python # Build a sample vectorDB from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma # Load blog post loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() # Split text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) # VectorDB embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=embedding) ``` #### Simple usage Specify the LLM to use for query generation, and the retriever will do the rest. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetriever question = ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) retriever_from_llm = MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm( retriever=vectordb.as_retriever(), llm=llm ) ``` ```python # Set logging for the queries import logging logging.basicConfig() logging.getLogger(""langchain.retrievers.multi_query"").setLevel(logging.INFO) ``` ```python unique_docs = retriever_from_llm.get_relevant_documents(query=question) len(unique_docs) ``` ```text INFO:langchain.retrievers.multi_query:Generated queries: [\'1.

Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. As a very simple example, let\'s suppose we have two templates optimized for different types of questions, and we want to choose the template based on the user input. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate physics_template = """"""You are a very smart physics professor. \\ You are great at answering questions about physics in a concise and easy to understand manner. \\ When you don\'t know the answer to a question you admit that you don\'t know.

A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch ``` ```python general_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a helpful assistant.

Router chains are made up of two components: - The `RouterChain` itself (responsible for selecting the next chain to call) - `destination_chains`: chains that the router chain can route to In this example, we will focus on the different types of routing chains. We will show these routing chains used in a `MultiPromptChain` to create a question-answering chain that selects the prompt which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using that prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.chains.router import MultiPromptChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` ### [Legacy] LLMRouterChain This chain uses an LLM to determine how to route things. ```python prompt_infos = [ { ""name"": ""physics"", ""description"": ""Good for answering questions about physics"", ""prompt_template"": physics_template, }, { ""name"": ""math"", ""description"": ""Good for answering math questions"", ""prompt_template"": math_template, }, ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() ``` ```python destination_chains = {} for p_info in prompt_infos: name = p_info[""name""] prompt_template = p_info[""prompt_template""] prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=[""input""]) chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) destination_chains[name] = chain default_chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, output_key=""text"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains.router.llm_router import LLMRouterChain, RouterOutputParser from langchain.chains.router.multi_prompt_prompt import MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE ``` ```python destinations = [f""{p[\'name\']}: {p[\'description\']}"" for p in prompt_infos] destinations_str = ""\\n"".join(destinations) router_template = MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE.format(destinations=destinations_str) router_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=router_template, input_variables=[""input""], output_parser=RouterOutputParser(), ) router_chain = LLMRouterChain.from_llm(llm, router_prompt) ``` ```python chain = MultiPromptChain( router_chain=router_chain, destination_chains=destination_chains, default_chain=default_chain, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is black body radiation?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is black body radiation?\'} > Finished chain. Black body radiation is the thermal electromagnetic radiation within or surrounding a body in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment, or emitted by a black body (an idealized physical body which absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation). It is a characteristic of the temperature of the body; if the body has a uniform temperature, the radiation is also uniform across the spectrum of frequencies. The spectral characteristics of the radiation are determined by the temperature of the body, which implies that a black body at a given temperature will emit the same amount of radiation at every frequency. ``` ```python print( chain.run( ""What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?"" ) ) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( math: {\'input\': \'What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?\'} > Finished chain. The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43. This can be seen by breaking down the problem: 1) We know that a prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and one. 2) We also know that if a number is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. So, if we want to find the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3, we can start counting up from 40, testing each number to see if it is prime and if the sum of the number and one is divisible by three. The first number we come to that satisfies these conditions is 43. ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?\'} > Finished chain. The type of cloud that rains is called a cumulonimbus cloud. ``` ## [Legacy] EmbeddingRouterChain The `EmbeddingRouterChain` uses embeddings and similarity to route between destination chains. ```python from langchain.chains.router.embedding_router import EmbeddingRouterChain from langchain.embeddings import CohereEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python names_and_descriptions = [ (""physics"", [""for questions about physics""]), (""math"", [""for questions about math""]), ] ``` ```python router_chain = EmbeddingRouterChain.from_names_and_descriptions( names_and_descriptions, Chroma, CohereEmbeddings(), routing_keys=[""input""] ) ``` ```python chain = MultiPromptChain( router_chain=router_chain, destination_chains=destination_chains, default_chain=default_chain, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is black body radiation?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... physics: {\'input\': \'What is black body radiation?\'} > Finished chain.

The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43. This is because 43 is a prime number, and 1 + 43 = 44, which is divisible by 3. ``` - [Using LCEL](#using-lcel) - [Legacy RouterChain](#legacy-routerchain)', 'LLM | LLM The most common type of chaining in any LLM application is combining a prompt template with an LLM and optionally an output parser. The recommended way to do this is using LangChain Expression Language. We also continue to support the legacy `LLMChain`, which is a single class for composing these three components. ## Using LCEL `BasePromptTemplate`, `BaseLanguageModel` and `BaseOutputParser` all implement the `Runnable` interface and are designed to be piped into one another, making LCEL composition very easy: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"" ) runnable = prompt | ChatOpenAI() | StrOutputParser() runnable.invoke({""product"": ""colorful socks""}) ``` ```text \'VibrantSocks\' ``` Head to the [LCEL](/docs/expression_language) section for more on the interface, built-in features, and cookbook examples. ## [Legacy] LLMChain This is a legacy class, using LCEL as shown above is preffered.An `LLMChain` is a simple chain that adds some functionality around language models. It is used widely throughout LangChain, including in other chains and agents. An `LLMChain` consists of a `PromptTemplate` and a language model (either an LLM or chat model). It formats the prompt template using the input key values provided (and also memory key values, if available), passes the formatted string to LLM and returns the LLM output. ### Get started ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = ""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"" llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template)) llm_chain(""colorful socks"") ``` ```text {\'product\': \'colorful socks\', \'text\': \'\\n\\nSocktastic!\'} ``` ### Additional ways of running LLMChain Aside from `__call__` and `run` methods shared by all `Chain` object, `LLMChain` offers a few more ways of calling the chain logic: - `apply` allows you run the chain against a list of inputs: ```python input_list = [{""product"": ""socks""}, {""product"": ""computer""}, {""product"": ""shoes""}] llm_chain.apply(input_list) ``` ```text [{\'text\': \'\\n\\nSocktastic!\'}, {\'text\': \'\\n\\nTechCore Solutions.\'}, {\'text\': \'\\n\\nFootwear Factory.\'}] ``` - `generate` is similar to `apply`, except it return an `LLMResult` instead of string. `LLMResult` often contains useful generation such as token usages and finish reason. ```python llm_chain.generate(input_list) ``` ```text LLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text=\'\\n\\nSocktastic!\', generation_info={\'finish_reason\': \'stop\', \'logprobs\': None})], [Generation(text=\'\\n\\nTechCore Solutions.\', generation_info={\'finish_reason\': \'stop\', \'logprobs\': None})], [Generation(text=\'\\n\\nFootwear Factory.\', generation_info={\'finish_reason\': \'stop\', \'logprobs\': None})]], llm_output={\'token_usage\': {\'completion_tokens\': 19, \'prompt_tokens\': 36, \'total_tokens\': 55}, \'model_name\': \'text-davinci-003\'}, run=[RunInfo(run_id=UUID(\'9a423a43-6d35-4e8f-9aca-cacfc8e0dc49\')), RunInfo(run_id=UUID(\'a879c077-b521-461c-8f29-ba63adfc327c\')), RunInfo(run_id=UUID(\'40b892fa-e8c2-47d0-a309-4f7a4ed5b64a\'))]) ``` - `predict` is similar to `run` method except that the input keys are specified as keyword arguments instead of a Python dict. ```python # Single input example llm_chain.predict(product=""colorful socks"") ``` ```text \'\\n\\nSocktastic!\' ``` ```python # Multiple inputs example template = """"""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {subject}."""""" prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[""adjective"", ""subject""]) llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=OpenAI(temperature=0)) llm_chain.predict(adjective=""sad"", subject=""ducks"") ``` ```text \'\\n\\nQ: What did the duck say when his friend died?\\nA: Quack, quack, goodbye.\' ``` ### Parsing the outputs By default, `LLMChain` does not parse the output even if the underlying `prompt` object has an output parser. If you would like to apply that output parser on the LLM output, use `predict_and_parse` instead of `predict` and `apply_and_parse` instead of `apply`. With `predict`: ```python from langchain.output_parsers import CommaSeparatedListOutputParser output_parser = CommaSeparatedListOutputParser() template = """"""List all the colors in a rainbow"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( template=template, input_variables=[], output_parser=output_parser ) llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm) llm_chain.predict() ``` ```text \'\\n\\nRed, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet\' ``` With `predict_and_parse`: ```python llm_chain.predict_and_parse() ``` ```text /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( [\'Red\', \'orange\', \'yellow\', \'green\', \'blue\', \'indigo\', \'violet\'] ``` ### Initialize from string You can also construct an `LLMChain` from a string template directly. ```python template = """"""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {subject}."""""" llm_chain = LLMChain.from_string(llm=llm, template=template) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(adjective=""sad"", subject=""ducks"") ``` ```text \'\\n\\nQ: What did the duck say when his friend died?\\nA: Quack, quack, goodbye.\' ``` - [Using LCEL](#using-lcel) - [Legacy LLMChain](#legacy-llmchain)', ""langchain.output_parsers.retry.RetryOutputParser LangChain 0.0.337 API Experimental Python Docs Toggle Menu PrevUp Next LangChain 0.0.337 langchain.output_parsers.retry.RetryOutputParser langchain.output_parsers.retry.RetryOutputParser class langchain.output_parsers.retry.RetryOutputParser[source] Bases: BaseOutputParser[T] Wraps a parser and tries to fix parsing errors.

The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1.

Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to ""Write a story outline."" This provides a high-level structure for the task and helps in breaking it down into smaller components.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Agents can also take inputs from humans to decompose tasks. This can be done through direct communication or by leveraging human expertise. Humans can provide guidance and insights to help the agent break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals.\\n\\nOverall, task decomposition allows agents to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals, enabling them to plan and execute complex tasks efficiently.\'} ``` ```python qa(""What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'The human asks how agents use task decomposition.

Long-Term Memory Management: This involves storing and organizing information in a long-term memory system.

Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents. This allows for easy retrieval and reference during the execution of the task.\\n\\nThese memory resources help the agent in organizing and managing information, making informed decisions, and effectively decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals.\'} ``` Again, we can use the [LangSmith trace]( to explore the prompt structure. ### Going deeper - Agents, such as the [conversational retrieval agent](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents), can be used for retrieval when necessary while also holding a conversation. - [Use case](#use-case) - [Overview](#overview) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Memory](#memory) - [Conversation](#conversation) - [Chat Retrieval](#chat-retrieval)- [Going deeper](#going-deeper)', 'Customizing Conversational Memory | Customizing Conversational Memory This notebook walks through a few ways to customize conversational memory. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ## AI prefix The first way to do so is by changing the AI prefix in the conversation summary.

Let\'s walk through an example of that in the example below. ```python # Here it is by default set to ""AI"" conversation = ConversationChain( llm=llm, verbose=True, memory=ConversationBufferMemory() ) ``` ```python conversation.predict(input=""Hi there!"") ``` ```text > Entering new ConversationChain chain...

They\'ve started by embedding the top 1200 Python libraries to enable code generation with up-to-date knowledge. They\'ve been kind enough to share their embeddings of the [LangChain docs]( and [API reference]( Let\'s take a look at how we can use these embeddings to power a docs retrieval system and ultimately a simple code generating chain! ```bash pip install langchain fleet-context openai pandas faiss-cpu # faiss-gpu for CUDA supported GPU ``` ```python from operator import itemgetter from typing import Any, Optional, Type import pandas as pd from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.retrievers import MultiVectorRetriever from langchain.schema import Document from langchain.schema.storage import BaseStore from langchain.schema.vectorstore import VectorStore from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS def load_fleet_retriever( df: pd.DataFrame, *, vectorstore_cls: Type[VectorStore] = FAISS, docstore: Optional[BaseStore] = None, **kwargs: Any, ): vectorstore = _populate_vectorstore(df, vectorstore_cls) if docstore is None: return vectorstore.as_retriever(**kwargs) else: _populate_docstore(df, docstore) return MultiVectorRetriever( vectorstore=vectorstore, docstore=docstore, id_key=""parent"", **kwargs ) def _populate_vectorstore( df: pd.DataFrame, vectorstore_cls: Type[VectorStore], ) -> VectorStore: if not hasattr(vectorstore_cls, ""from_embeddings""): raise ValueError( f""Incompatible vector store class {vectorstore_cls}.""

This means the vectors correspond to sections of pages in the LangChain docs, not entire pages. By default, when we spin up a retriever from these embeddings, we\'ll be retrieving these embedded chunks.

But, retrieval may produce different results with subtle changes in query wording or if the embeddings do not capture the semantics of the data well.

The `MultiQueryRetriever` automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents.

RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.

It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Task decomposition can be performed by AI models with prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ### Go deeper #### Choosing LLMs `ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model wrapper.

There are two main things we need to do to support this. 1. Add a messages placeholder to our chain which allows us to pass in historical messages 2. Add a chain that takes the latest user query and reformulates it in the context of the chat history into a standalone question that can be passed to our retriever. Let\'s start with 2. We can build a ""condense question"" chain that looks something like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder condense_q_system_prompt = """"""Given a chat history and the latest user question \\ which might reference the chat history, formulate a standalone question \\ which can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \\ just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."""""" condense_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", condense_q_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) condense_q_chain = condense_q_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""What is meant by large"", } ) ``` ```text \'What is the definition of ""large"" in the context of a language model?\' ``` ```python condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""How do transformers work"", } ) ``` ```text \'How do transformer models function?\' ``` And now we can build our full QA chain. Notice we add some routing functionality to only run the ""condense question chain"" when our chat history isn\'t empty. ```python qa_system_prompt = """"""You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \\ Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. \\ If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. \\ Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\ {context}"""""" qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", qa_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) def condense_question(input: dict): if input.get(""chat_history""): return condense_q_chain else: return input[""question""] rag_chain = ( RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=condense_question | retriever | format_docs) | qa_prompt | llm ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] question = ""What is Task Decomposition?"" ai_msg = rag_chain.invoke({""question"": question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=question), ai_msg]) second_question = ""What are common ways of doing it?"" rag_chain.invoke({""question"": second_question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'Common ways of task decomposition include:\\n\\n1.

A retriever is an interface that returns documents given an unstructured query. It is more general than a vector store. A retriever does not need to be able to store documents, only to return (or retrieve) them. Vector stores can be used as the backbone of a retriever, but there are other types of retrievers as well. Retrievers implement the [Runnable interface](/docs/expression_language/interface), the basic building block of the [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/expression_language/). This means they support `invoke`, `ainvoke`, `stream`, `astream`, `batch`, `abatch`, `astream_log` calls. Retrievers accept a string query as input and return a list of `Document`\'s as output. ## Get started In this example we\'ll use a `Chroma` vector store-backed retriever. To get setup we\'ll need to run: ```bash pip install chromadb ``` And download the state_of_the_union.txt file [here]( ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma full_text = open(""state_of_the_union.txt"", ""r"").read() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100) texts = text_splitter.split_text(full_text) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() db = Chroma.from_texts(texts, embeddings) retriever = db.as_retriever() ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.invoke( ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson?"" ) print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\'s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\'s legacy of excellence. A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she\'s been nominated, she\'s received a broad range of supportfrom the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. We can do both. At our border, we\'ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling. We\'ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers. ``` ## LCEL Since retrievers are `Runnable`\'s, we can easily compose them with other `Runnable` objects: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough template = """"""Answer the question based only on the following context: {context} Question: {question} """""" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template) model = ChatOpenAI() def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join([d.page_content for d in docs]) chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke(""What did the president say about technology?"") ``` ```text \'The president said that technology plays a crucial role in the future and that passing the Bipartisan Innovation Act will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing. The president also mentioned Intel\\\'s plans to build a semiconductor ""mega site"" and increase their investment from $20 billion to $100 billion, which would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history.\' ``` - [Get started](#get-started) - [LCEL](#lcel)', 'Backed by a Vector Store | Backed by a Vector Store `VectorStoreRetrieverMemory` stores memories in a vector store and queries the top-K most ""salient"" docs every time it is called.

You can access your database in SQL and also from here, LangChain. `MyScale` can make use of [various data types and functions for filters]( It will boost up your LLM app no matter if you are scaling up your data or expand your system to broader application. In the notebook, we\'ll demo the `SelfQueryRetriever` wrapped around a `MyScale` vector store with some extra pieces we contributed to LangChain. In short, it can be condensed into 4 points: 1. Add `contain` comparator to match the list of any if there is more than one element matched 2. Add `timestamp` data type for datetime match (ISO-format, or YYYY-MM-DD) 3. Add `like` comparator for string pattern search 4. Add arbitrary function capability ## Creating a MyScale vector store MyScale has already been integrated to LangChain for a while. So you can follow [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/myscale) to create your own vectorstore for a self-query retriever. **Note:** All self-query retrievers requires you to have `lark` installed (`pip install lark`). We use `lark` for grammar definition. Before you proceed to the next step, we also want to remind you that `clickhouse-connect` is also needed to interact with your MyScale backend. ```bash pip install lark clickhouse-connect ``` In this tutorial we follow other example\'s setting and use `OpenAIEmbeddings`. Remember to get an OpenAI API Key for valid access to LLMs. ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") os.environ[""MYSCALE_HOST""] = getpass.getpass(""MyScale URL:"") os.environ[""MYSCALE_PORT""] = getpass.getpass(""MyScale Port:"") os.environ[""MYSCALE_USERNAME""] = getpass.getpass(""MyScale Username:"") os.environ[""MYSCALE_PASSWORD""] = getpass.getpass(""MyScale Password:"") ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import Document from langchain.vectorstores import MyScale embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ## Create some sample data As you can see, the data we created has some differences compared to other self-query retrievers. We replaced the keyword `year` with `date` which gives you finer control on timestamps. We also changed the type of the keyword `gerne` to a list of strings, where an LLM can use a new `contain` comparator to construct filters. We also provide the `like` comparator and arbitrary function support to filters, which will be introduced in next few cells. Now let\'s look at the data first. ```python docs = [ Document( page_content=""A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose"", metadata={""date"": ""1993-07-02"", ""rating"": 7.7, ""genre"": [""science fiction""]}, ), Document( page_content=""Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ..."", metadata={""date"": ""2010-12-30"", ""director"": ""Christopher Nolan"", ""rating"": 8.2}, ), Document( page_content=""A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea"", metadata={""date"": ""2006-04-23"", ""director"": ""Satoshi Kon"", ""rating"": 8.6}, ), Document( page_content=""A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them"", metadata={""date"": ""2019-08-22"", ""director"": ""Greta Gerwig"", ""rating"": 8.3}, ), Document( page_content=""Toys come alive and have a blast doing so"", metadata={""date"": ""1995-02-11"", ""genre"": [""animated""]}, ), Document( page_content=""Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone"", metadata={ ""date"": ""1979-09-10"", ""director"": ""Andrei Tarkovsky"", ""genre"": [""science fiction"", ""adventure""], ""rating"": 9.9, }, ), ] vectorstore = MyScale.from_documents( docs, embeddings, ) ``` ## Creating our self-querying retriever Just like other retrievers... simple and nice. ```python from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever metadata_field_info = [ AttributeInfo( name=""genre"", description=""The genres of the movie"", type=""list[string]"", ), # If you want to include length of a list, just define it as a new column # This will teach the LLM to use it as a column when constructing filter. AttributeInfo( name=""length(genre)"", description=""The length of genres of the movie"", type=""integer"", ), # Now you can define a column as timestamp. By simply set the type to timestamp. AttributeInfo( name=""date"", description=""The date the movie was released"", type=""timestamp"", ), AttributeInfo( name=""director"", description=""The name of the movie director"", type=""string"", ), AttributeInfo( name=""rating"", description=""A 1-10 rating for the movie"", type=""float"" ), ] document_content_description = ""Brief summary of a movie"" llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm( llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True ) ``` ## Testing it out with self-query retriever\'s existing functionalities And now we can try actually using our retriever! ```python # This example only specifies a relevant query retriever.get_relevant_documents(""What are some movies about dinosaurs"") ``` ```python # This example only specifies a filter retriever.get_relevant_documents(""I want to watch a movie rated higher than 8.5"") ``` ```python # This example specifies a query and a filter retriever.get_relevant_documents(""Has Greta Gerwig directed any movies about women"") ``` ```python # This example specifies a composite filter retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What\'s a highly rated (above 8.5) science fiction film?"" ) ``` ```python # This example specifies a query and composite filter retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What\'s a movie after 1990 but before 2005 that\'s all about toys, and preferably is animated"" ) ``` # Wait a second... what else? Self-query retriever with MyScale can do more! Let\'s find out. ```python # You can use length(genres) to do anything you want retriever.get_relevant_documents(""What\'s a movie that have more than 1 genres?"") ``` ```python # Fine-grained datetime? You got it already. retriever.get_relevant_documents(""What\'s a movie that release after feb 1995?"") ``` ```python # Don\'t know what your exact filter should be? Use string pattern match! retriever.get_relevant_documents(""What\'s a movie whose name is like Andrei?"") ``` ```python # Contain works for lists: so you can match a list with contain comparator! retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What\'s a movie who has genres science fiction and adventure?"" ) ``` ## Filter k We can also use the self query retriever to specify `k`: the number of documents to fetch. We can do this by passing `enable_limit=True` to the constructor. ```python retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm( llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, enable_limit=True, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python # This example only specifies a relevant query retriever.get_relevant_documents(""what are two movies about dinosaurs"") ``` - [Creating a MyScale vector store](#creating-a-myscale-vector-store) - [Create some sample data](#create-some-sample-data) - [Creating our self-querying retriever](#creating-our-self-querying-retriever) - [Testing it out with self-query retriever\'s existing functionalities](#testing-it-out-with-self-query-retrievers-existing-functionalities) - [Filter k](#filter-k)']",Retrieve relevant documents.,The main purpose of the time-weighted vector store retriever is to use a combination of semantic similarity and a time decay to retrieve relevant vectors.,0.9166666666361111,1.0,1.0,0.0007763186945116723,0.13793103448275862

Resources\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWelcome to LangChain#\\\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling\\\\ndevelopers to build applications that they previously could not.\\\\nBut using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to\\\\ncreate a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you are able to\\\\ncombine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.\\\\nThis library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these types of applications include:\\\\n Question Answering over specific documents\\\\n\\\\nDocumentation\\\\nEnd-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database\\\\n\\\\n Chatbots\\\\n\\\\nDocumentation\\\\nEnd-to-end Example: Chat-LangChain\\\\n\\\\n Agents\\\\n\\\\nDocumentation\\\\nEnd-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGetting Started#\\\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\\\n\\\\nGetting Started Documentation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nModules#\\\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\\\\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\\\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\\\n\\\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\\\nLLMs: This includes a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.\\\\nDocument Loaders: This includes a standard interface for loading documents, as well as specific integrations to all types of text data sources.\\\\nUtils: Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more. LangChain provides a large collection of common utils to use in your application.\\\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\\\nChat: Chat models are a variation on Language Models that expose a different API - rather than working with raw text, they work with messages. LangChain provides a standard interface for working with them and doing all the same things as above.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUse Cases#\\\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\\\n\\\\nAgents: Agents are systems that use a language model to interact with other tools. These can be used to do more grounded question/answering, interact with APIs, or even take actions.\\\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\\\nData Augmented Generation: Data Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external datasource to fetch data to use in the generation step. Examples of this include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.\\\\nQuestion Answering: Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\\\nGenerate similar examples: Generating similar examples to a given input. This is a common use case for many applications, and LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\\\nCompare models: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nReference Docs#\\\\nAll of LangChain\'s reference documentation, in one place.

Resources\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWelcome to LangChain#\\\\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\\\\n\\\\nBe data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data\\\\nBe agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment\\\\n\\\\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\\\\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.\\\\n\\\\nGetting Started#\\\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\\\n\\\\nGetting Started Documentation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nModules#\\\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\\\\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\\\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\\\n\\\\nModels: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\\\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility).

LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\\\n\\\\nPersonal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\\\\nQuestion Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\\\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\\\nInteracting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\\\\nExtraction: Extract structured information from text.\\\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics.

The SitemapLoader constructor accepts a custom scraping function. This feature can be helpful to tailor the scraping process to your specific needs; for example, you might want to avoid scraping headers or navigation elements. The following example shows how to develop and use a custom function to avoid navigation and header elements.Import the beautifulsoup4 library and define the custom function.pip install beautifulsoup4from bs4 import BeautifulSoupdef remove_nav_and_header_elements(content: BeautifulSoup) -> str: # Find all \\\'nav\\\' and \\\'header\\\' elements in the BeautifulSoup object nav_elements = content.find_all(""nav"") header_elements = content.find_all(""header"") # Remove each \\\'nav\\\' and \\\'header\\\' element from the BeautifulSoup object for element in nav_elements + header_elements: element.decompose() return str(content.get_text())Add your custom function to the SitemapLoader object.loader = SitemapLoader( "" filter_urls=["" parsing_function=remove_nav_and_header_elements,)Local Sitemap\\u200bThe sitemap loader can also be used to load local files.sitemap_loader = SitemapLoader(web_path=""example_data/sitemap.xml"", is_local=True)docs = sitemap_loader.load() Fetching pages: 100%|####################################################################################################################################| 3/3 [00:00<00:00, 3.91it/s]PreviousRSTNextSlackFiltering sitemap URLsAdd custom scraping rulesLocal SitemapCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogCopyright 2023 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\', metadata={\'source\': \' \'loc\': \' \'changefreq\': \'weekly\', \'priority\': \'0.5\'}) ``` ## Add custom scraping rules By default, the parser **removes** all but the main content of the docusaurus page, which is normally the `` tag. You also have the option to define an **inclusive** list HTML tags by providing them as a list utilizing the `custom_html_tags` parameter. For example: ```python loader = DocusaurusLoader( "" filter_urls=[ "" ], # This will only include the content that matches these tags, otherwise they will be removed custom_html_tags=[""#content"", "".main""], ) ``` You can also define an entirely custom parsing function if you need finer-grained control over the returned content for each page. The following example shows how to develop and use a custom function to avoid navigation and header elements. ```python from bs4 import BeautifulSoup def remove_nav_and_header_elements(content: BeautifulSoup) -> str: # Find all \'nav\' and \'header\' elements in the BeautifulSoup object nav_elements = content.find_all(""nav"") header_elements = content.find_all(""header"") # Remove each \'nav\' and \'header\' element from the BeautifulSoup object for element in nav_elements + header_elements: element.decompose() return str(content.get_text()) ``` Add your custom function to the `DocusaurusLoader` object. ```python loader = DocusaurusLoader( "" filter_urls=[ "" ], parsing_function=remove_nav_and_header_elements, ) ``` - [Filtering sitemap URLs](#filtering-sitemap-urls) - [Add custom scraping rules](#add-custom-scraping-rules)', 'Markdown | Markdown [Markdown]( is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. As a very simple example, let\'s suppose we have two templates optimized for different types of questions, and we want to choose the template based on the user input. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate physics_template = """"""You are a very smart physics professor. \\ You are great at answering questions about physics in a concise and easy to understand manner. \\ When you don\'t know the answer to a question you admit that you don\'t know.

Here is a question: {input}"""""" math_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(math_template) ``` ## Using LCEL We can easily do this using a `RunnableBranch`. A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch ``` ```python general_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a helpful assistant.

Router chains are made up of two components: - The `RouterChain` itself (responsible for selecting the next chain to call) - `destination_chains`: chains that the router chain can route to In this example, we will focus on the different types of routing chains. We will show these routing chains used in a `MultiPromptChain` to create a question-answering chain that selects the prompt which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using that prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.chains.router import MultiPromptChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` ### [Legacy] LLMRouterChain This chain uses an LLM to determine how to route things. ```python prompt_infos = [ { ""name"": ""physics"", ""description"": ""Good for answering questions about physics"", ""prompt_template"": physics_template, }, { ""name"": ""math"", ""description"": ""Good for answering math questions"", ""prompt_template"": math_template, }, ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() ``` ```python destination_chains = {} for p_info in prompt_infos: name = p_info[""name""] prompt_template = p_info[""prompt_template""] prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=[""input""]) chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) destination_chains[name] = chain default_chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, output_key=""text"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains.router.llm_router import LLMRouterChain, RouterOutputParser from langchain.chains.router.multi_prompt_prompt import MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE ``` ```python destinations = [f""{p[\'name\']}: {p[\'description\']}"" for p in prompt_infos] destinations_str = ""\\n"".join(destinations) router_template = MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE.format(destinations=destinations_str) router_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=router_template, input_variables=[""input""], output_parser=RouterOutputParser(), ) router_chain = LLMRouterChain.from_llm(llm, router_prompt) ``` ```python chain = MultiPromptChain( router_chain=router_chain, destination_chains=destination_chains, default_chain=default_chain, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is black body radiation?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is black body radiation?\'} > Finished chain. Black body radiation is the thermal electromagnetic radiation within or surrounding a body in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment, or emitted by a black body (an idealized physical body which absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation). It is a characteristic of the temperature of the body; if the body has a uniform temperature, the radiation is also uniform across the spectrum of frequencies. The spectral characteristics of the radiation are determined by the temperature of the body, which implies that a black body at a given temperature will emit the same amount of radiation at every frequency. ``` ```python print( chain.run( ""What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?"" ) ) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( math: {\'input\': \'What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?\'} > Finished chain. The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43. This can be seen by breaking down the problem: 1) We know that a prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and one. 2) We also know that if a number is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. So, if we want to find the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3, we can start counting up from 40, testing each number to see if it is prime and if the sum of the number and one is divisible by three. The first number we come to that satisfies these conditions is 43. ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?\'} > Finished chain. The type of cloud that rains is called a cumulonimbus cloud. ``` ## [Legacy] EmbeddingRouterChain The `EmbeddingRouterChain` uses embeddings and similarity to route between destination chains. ```python from langchain.chains.router.embedding_router import EmbeddingRouterChain from langchain.embeddings import CohereEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python names_and_descriptions = [ (""physics"", [""for questions about physics""]), (""math"", [""for questions about math""]), ] ``` ```python router_chain = EmbeddingRouterChain.from_names_and_descriptions( names_and_descriptions, Chroma, CohereEmbeddings(), routing_keys=[""input""] ) ``` ```python chain = MultiPromptChain( router_chain=router_chain, destination_chains=destination_chains, default_chain=default_chain, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is black body radiation?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... physics: {\'input\': \'What is black body radiation?\'} > Finished chain. Black body radiation is the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body, which is an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation.

The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43.

This is particularly useful if you want easier access to the underlying database. You can also specify the collection name that you want LangChain to use. ```python import chromadb persistent_client = chromadb.PersistentClient() collection = persistent_client.get_or_create_collection(""collection_name"") collection.add(ids=[""1"", ""2"", ""3""], documents=[""a"", ""b"", ""c""]) langchain_chroma = Chroma( client=persistent_client, collection_name=""collection_name"", embedding_function=embedding_function, ) print(""There are"", langchain_chroma._collection.count(), ""in the collection"") ``` ```text Add of existing embedding ID: 1 Add of existing embedding ID: 2 Add of existing embedding ID: 3 Add of existing embedding ID: 1 Add of existing embedding ID: 2 Add of existing embedding ID: 3 Add of existing embedding ID: 1 Insert of existing embedding ID: 1 Add of existing embedding ID: 2 Insert of existing embedding ID: 2 Add of existing embedding ID: 3 Insert of existing embedding ID: 3 There are 3 in the collection ``` ## Basic Example (using the Docker Container) You can also run the Chroma Server in a Docker container separately, create a Client to connect to it, and then pass that to LangChain. Chroma has the ability to handle multiple `Collections` of documents, but the LangChain interface expects one, so we need to specify the collection name. The default collection name used by LangChain is ""langchain"". Here is how to clone, build, and run the Docker Image: ```sh git clone ``` Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and add `ALLOW_RESET=TRUE` under `environment` ```yaml ... command: uvicorn chromadb.app:app --reload --workers 1 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --log-config log_config.yml environment: - IS_PERSISTENT=TRUE - ALLOW_RESET=TRUE ports: - 8000:8000 ... ``` Then run `docker-compose up -d --build` ```python # create the chroma client import uuid import chromadb from chromadb.config import Settings client = chromadb.HttpClient(settings=Settings(allow_reset=True)) client.reset() # resets the database collection = client.create_collection(""my_collection"") for doc in docs: collection.add( ids=[str(uuid.uuid1())], metadatas=doc.metadata, documents=doc.page_content ) # tell LangChain to use our client and collection name db4 = Chroma( client=client, collection_name=""my_collection"", embedding_function=embedding_function, ) query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" docs = db4.similarity_search(query) print(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tonight.

Chroma has users provide `ids` to simplify the bookkeeping here. `ids` can be the name of the file, or a combined has like `filename_paragraphNumber`, etc. Chroma supports all these operations - though some of them are still being integrated all the way through the LangChain interface. Additional workflow improvements will be added soon. Here is a basic example showing how to do various operations: ```python # create simple ids ids = [str(i) for i in range(1, len(docs) + 1)] # add data example_db = Chroma.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, ids=ids) docs = example_db.similarity_search(query) print(docs[0].metadata) # update the metadata for a document docs[0].metadata = { ""source"": ""../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt"", ""new_value"": ""hello world"", } example_db.update_document(ids[0], docs[0]) print(example_db._collection.get(ids=[ids[0]])) # delete the last document print(""count before"", example_db._collection.count()) example_db._collection.delete(ids=[ids[-1]]) print(""count after"", example_db._collection.count()) ``` ```text {\'source\': \'../../../state_of_the_union.txt\'} {\'ids\': [\'1\'], \'embeddings\': None, \'metadatas\': [{\'new_value\': \'hello world\', \'source\': \'../../../state_of_the_union.txt\'}], \'documents\': [\'Tonight.

33,whats an agent type that works well with Anthropic's models and supports structured output?,"['Anthropic | Anthropic All functionality related to Anthropic models. [Anthropic]( is an AI safety and research company, and is the creator of Claude. This page covers all integrations between Anthropic models and LangChain. ## Prompting Overview Claude is chat-based model, meaning it is trained on conversation data. However, it is a text based API, meaning it takes in single string. It expects this string to be in a particular format. This means that it is up the user to ensure that is the case. LangChain provides several utilities and helper functions to make sure prompts that you write - whether formatted as a string or as a list of messages - end up formatted correctly. Specifically, Claude is trained to fill in text for the Assistant role as part of an ongoing dialogue between a human user (`Human:`) and an AI assistant (`Assistant:`). Prompts sent via the API must contain `\\n\\nHuman:` and `\\n\\nAssistant:` as the signals of who\'s speaking. The final turn must always be `\\n\\nAssistant:` - the input string cannot have `\\n\\nHuman:` as the final role. Because Claude is chat-based but accepts a string as input, it can be treated as either a LangChain `ChatModel` or `LLM`. This means there are two wrappers in LangChain - `ChatAnthropic` and `Anthropic`. It is generally recommended to use the `ChatAnthropic` wrapper, and format your prompts as `ChatMessage`s (we will show examples of this below). This is because it keeps your prompt in a general format that you can easily then also use with other models (should you want to). However, if you want more fine-grained control over the prompt, you can use the `Anthropic` wrapper - we will show and example of this as well. The `Anthropic` wrapper however is deprecated, as all functionality can be achieved in a more generic way using `ChatAnthropic`. ## Prompting Best Practices Anthropic models have several prompting best practices compared to OpenAI models. **No System Messages** Anthropic models are not trained on the concept of a ""system message"". We have worked with the Anthropic team to handle them somewhat appropriately (a Human message with an `admin` tag) but this is largely a hack and it is recommended that you do not use system messages. **AI Messages Can Continue** A completion from Claude is a continuation of the last text in the string which allows you further control over Claude\'s output. For example, putting words in Claude\'s mouth in a prompt like this: `\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: What do you call a bear with no teeth?` This will return a completion like this `A gummy bear!` instead of a whole new assistant message with a different random bear joke. ## ChatAnthropic `ChatAnthropic` is a subclass of LangChain\'s `ChatModel`, meaning it works best with `ChatPromptTemplate`. You can import this wrapper with the following code: ```text from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic model = ChatAnthropic() ``` When working with ChatModels, it is preferred that you design your prompts as `ChatPromptTemplate`s. Here is an example below of doing that: ```text from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", ""You are a helpful chatbot""), (""human"", ""Tell me a joke about {topic}""), ]) ``` You can then use this in a chain as follows: ```text chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` How is the prompt actually being formatted under the hood? We can see that by running the following code ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nYou are a helpful chatbot\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that under the hood LangChain is not appending any prefix/suffix to `SystemMessage`\'s. This is because Anthropic has no concept of `SystemMessage`. Anthropic requires all prompts to end with assistant messages. This means if the last message is not an assistant message, the suffix `Assistant:` will automatically be inserted. If you decide instead to use a normal PromptTemplate (one that just works on a single string) let\'s take a look at what happens: ```text from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that it automatically adds the Human and Assistant tags. What is happening under the hood? First: the string gets converted to a single human message. This happens generically (because we are using a subclass of `ChatModel`). Then, similarly to the above example, an empty Assistant message is getting appended. This is Anthropic specific. ## [Deprecated] Anthropic This `Anthropic` wrapper is subclassed from `LLM`. We can import it with: ```text from langchain.llms import Anthropic model = Anthropic() ``` This model class is designed to work with normal PromptTemplates. An example of that is below: ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` Let\'s see what is going on with the prompt templating under the hood! ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs the following ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:\\n\' ``` Notice that it adds the Human tag at the start of the string, and then finishes it with `\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:`. The extra `Sure, here you go` was added on purpose by the Anthropic team. What happens if we have those symbols in the prompt directly? ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Human: Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\' ``` We can see that we detect that the user is trying to use the special tokens, and so we don\'t do any formatting. - [Prompting Overview](#prompting-overview) - [Prompting Best Practices](#prompting-best-practices) - [ChatAnthropic](#chatanthropic) - [Deprecated Anthropic](#deprecated-anthropic)', 'Templates | Templates Highlighting a few different categories of templates ## Popular These are some of the more popular templates to get started with. - [Retrieval Augmented Generation Chatbot](/docs/templates/rag-conversation): Build a chatbot over your data.

Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`.

An action can either be using a tool and observing its output, or returning a response to the user. Here are the agents available in LangChain. ## Zero-shot ReAct This agent uses the [ReAct]( framework to determine which tool to use based solely on the tool's description. Any number of tools can be provided. This agent requires that a description is provided for each tool. **Note**: This is the most general purpose action agent. ## Structured input ReAct The structured tool chat agent is capable of using multi-input tools. Older agents are configured to specify an action input as a single string, but this agent can use a tools' argument schema to create a structured action input. This is useful for more complex tool usage, like precisely navigating around a browser. ## OpenAI Functions Certain OpenAI models (like gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613) have been explicitly fine-tuned to detect when a function should be called and respond with the inputs that should be passed to the function. The OpenAI Functions Agent is designed to work with these models. ## Conversational This agent is designed to be used in conversational settings. The prompt is designed to make the agent helpful and conversational. It uses the ReAct framework to decide which tool to use, and uses memory to remember the previous conversation interactions. ## Self-ask with search This agent utilizes a single tool that should be named `Intermediate Answer`. This tool should be able to look up factual answers to questions. This agent is equivalent to the original [self-ask with search paper]( where a Google search API was provided as the tool. ## ReAct document store This agent uses the ReAct framework to interact with a docstore. Two tools must be provided: a `Search` tool and a `Lookup` tool (they must be named exactly as so). The `Search` tool should search for a document, while the `Lookup` tool should look up a term in the most recently found document.

Clarifai provides an AI platform with the full AI lifecycle for data exploration, data labeling, model training, evaluation and inference around images, video, text and audio data. In the LangChain ecosystem, as far as we're aware, Clarifai is the only provider that supports LLMs, embeddings and a vector store in one production scale platform, making it an excellent choice to operationalize your LangChain implementations. ## Installation and Setup - Install the Python SDK: ```bash pip install clarifai ``` [Sign-up]( for a Clarifai account, then get a personal access token to access the Clarifai API from your [security settings]( and set it as an environment variable (`CLARIFAI_PAT`). ## Models Clarifai provides 1,000s of AI models for many different use cases. You can [explore them here]( to find the one most suited for your use case. These models include those created by other providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, AI21, etc. as well as state of the art from open source such as Falcon, InstructorXL, etc. so that you build the best in AI into your products. You'll find these organized by the creator's user_id and into projects we call applications denoted by their app_id. Those IDs will be needed in additional to the model_id and optionally the version_id, so make note of all these IDs once you found the best model for your use case! Also note that given there are many models for images, video, text and audio understanding, you can build some interested AI agents that utilize the variety of AI models as experts to understand those data types. ### LLMs To find the selection of LLMs in the Clarifai platform you can select the text to text model type [here]( ```python from langchain.llms import Clarifai llm = Clarifai(pat=CLARIFAI_PAT, user_id=USER_ID, app_id=APP_ID, model_id=MODEL_ID) ``` For more details, the docs on the Clarifai LLM wrapper provide a [detailed walkthrough](/docs/integrations/llms/clarifai). ### Text Embedding Models To find the selection of text embeddings models in the Clarifai platform you can select the text to embedding model type [here]( There is a Clarifai Embedding model in LangChain, which you can access with: ```python from langchain.embeddings import ClarifaiEmbeddings embeddings = ClarifaiEmbeddings(pat=CLARIFAI_PAT, user_id=USER_ID, app_id=APP_ID, model_id=MODEL_ID) ``` For more details, the docs on the Clarifai Embeddings wrapper provide a [detailed walkthrough](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/clarifai). ## Vectorstore Clarifai's vector DB was launched in 2016 and has been optimized to support live search queries. With workflows in the Clarifai platform, you data is automatically indexed by am embedding model and optionally other models as well to index that information in the DB for search. You can query the DB not only via the vectors but also filter by metadata matches, other AI predicted concepts, and even do geo-coordinate search. Simply create an application, select the appropriate base workflow for your type of data, and upload it (through the API as [documented here]( or the UIs at clarifai.com). You can also add data directly from LangChain as well, and the auto-indexing will take place for you. You'll notice this is a little different than other vectorstores where you need to provide an embedding model in their constructor and have LangChain coordinate getting the embeddings from text and writing those to the index. Not only is it more convenient, but it's much more scalable to use Clarifai's distributed cloud to do all the index in the background. ```python from langchain.vectorstores import Clarifai clarifai_vector_db = Clarifai.from_texts(user_id=USER_ID, app_id=APP_ID, texts=texts, pat=CLARIFAI_PAT, number_of_docs=NUMBER_OF_DOCS, metadatas = metadatas) ``` For more details, the docs on the Clarifai vector store provide a [detailed walkthrough](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/clarifai). - [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) - [Models](#models)- [LLMs](#llms) - [Text Embedding Models](#text-embedding-models) - [Vectorstore](#vectorstore)""]",Structured input ReAct,"The XML agent works well with Anthropic's Claude 2 model.

Vectorstores often have a hard time answering questions that requires computing, grouping and filtering structured data so the high level idea is to use a `pandas`dataframe to help with these types of questions. 1. Load data from Stripe using Airbyte. user the `record_handler`paramater to return a JSON from the data loader. ```python import os import pandas as pd from langchain.agents import AgentType, create_pandas_dataframe_agent from langchain.chat_models.openai import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders.airbyte import AirbyteStripeLoader stream_name = ""customers"" config = { ""client_secret"": os.getenv(""STRIPE_CLIENT_SECRET""), ""account_id"": os.getenv(""STRIPE_ACCOUNT_D""), ""start_date"": ""2023-01-20T00:00:00Z"", } def handle_record(record: dict, _id: str): return record.data loader = AirbyteStripeLoader( config=config, record_handler=handle_record, stream_name=stream_name, ) data = loader.load() ``` 1. Pass the data to `pandas`dataframe. ```python df = pd.DataFrame(data) ``` 1. Pass the dataframe `df` to the `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` and invoke ```python agent = create_pandas_dataframe_agent( ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model=""gpt-4""), df, verbose=True, agent_type=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS, ) ``` 1. Run the agent ```python output = agent.run(""How many rows are there?"") ```', 'Custom Trajectory Evaluator | Custom Trajectory Evaluator []( You can make your own custom trajectory evaluators by inheriting from the [AgentTrajectoryEvaluator]( class and overwriting the `_evaluate_agent_trajectory` (and `_aevaluate_agent_action`) method. In this example, you will make a simple trajectory evaluator that uses an LLM to determine if any actions were unnecessary. ```python from typing import Any, Optional, Sequence, Tuple from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.evaluation import AgentTrajectoryEvaluator from langchain.schema import AgentAction class StepNecessityEvaluator(AgentTrajectoryEvaluator): """"""Evaluate the perplexity of a predicted string."""""" def __init__(self) -> None: llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"", temperature=0.0) template = """"""Are any of the following steps unnecessary in answering {input}?

It returns the string \'decision\' as the \'value\', and includes the rest of the generated text as \'reasoning\' to let you audit the decision. You can call this evaluator to grade the intermediate steps of your agent\'s trajectory. ```python evaluator = StepNecessityEvaluator() evaluator.evaluate_agent_trajectory( prediction=""The answer is pi"", input=""What is today?"", agent_trajectory=[ ( AgentAction(tool=""ask"", tool_input=""What is today?"", log=""""), ""tomorrow\'s yesterday"", ), ( AgentAction(tool=""check_tv"", tool_input=""Watch tv for half hour"", log=""""), ""bzzz"", ), ], ) ``` ```text {\'score\': 1, \'value\': \'Y\', \'reasoning\': \'Y\'} ```', 'Conversational | Conversational This walkthrough demonstrates how to use an agent optimized for conversation. Other agents are often optimized for using tools to figure out the best response, which is not ideal in a conversational setting where you may want the agent to be able to chat with the user as well.

You can do this with either string prompts or chat prompts. Constructing prompts this way allows for easy reuse of components. ## String prompt pipelining When working with string prompts, each template is joined together. You can work with either prompts directly or strings (the first element in the list needs to be a prompt). ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` ```python prompt = ( PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") + "", make it funny"" + ""\\n\\nand in {language}"" ) ``` ```python prompt ``` ```text PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'language\', \'topic\'], output_parser=None, partial_variables={}, template=\'Tell me a joke about {topic}, make it funny\\n\\nand in {language}\', template_format=\'f-string\', validate_template=True) ``` ```python prompt.format(topic=""sports"", language=""spanish"") ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke about sports, make it funny\\n\\nand in spanish\' ``` You can also use it in an LLMChain, just like before. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=prompt) ``` ```python chain.run(topic=""sports"", language=""spanish"") ``` ```text \'Por qu el futbolista llevaba un paraguas al partido?\\n\\nPorque pronosticaban lluvia de goles.\' ``` ## Chat prompt pipelining A chat prompt is made up a of a list of messages. Purely for developer experience, we\'ve added a convinient way to create these prompts. In this pipeline, each new element is a new message in the final prompt. ```python from langchain.schema import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage ``` First, let\'s initialize the base ChatPromptTemplate with a system message. It doesn\'t have to start with a system, but it\'s often good practice ```python prompt = SystemMessage(content=""You are a nice pirate"") ``` You can then easily create a pipeline combining it with other messages _or_ message templates. Use a `Message` when there is no variables to be formatted, use a `MessageTemplate` when there are variables to be formatted. You can also use just a string (note: this will automatically get inferred as a HumanMessagePromptTemplate.) ```python new_prompt = ( prompt + HumanMessage(content=""hi"") + AIMessage(content=""what?"") + ""{input}"" ) ``` Under the hood, this creates an instance of the ChatPromptTemplate class, so you can use it just as you did before! ```python new_prompt.format_messages(input=""i said hi"") ``` ```text [SystemMessage(content=\'You are a nice pirate\', additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessage(content=\'hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'what?\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=\'i said hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)] ``` You can also use it in an LLMChain, just like before. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=new_prompt) ``` ```python chain.run(""i said hi"") ``` ```text \'Oh, hello!

My architecture is based on a transformer model, which is a type of neural network that\'s particularly well-suited for natural language processing tasks. As for my parameters, I have a few billion parameters, but I don\'t have access to the exact number as it\'s not relevant to my functioning. My training data includes a vast amount of text from various sources, including books, articles, and websites, which I use to learn patterns and relationships in language. I\'m designed to be a helpful tool for a variety of tasks, such as answering questions, providing information, and generating text. I\'m constantly learning and improving my abilities through machine learning algorithms and feedback from users like you. I hope this helps!

Indeed, I\'m a transformer model, specifically a BERT-like language model trained on a large corpus of text data. My architecture is based on the transformer framework, which is a type of neural network designed for natural language processing tasks. As for the number of parameters, I have approximately 340 million. *winks* That\'s a pretty hefty number, if I do say so myself! These parameters allow me to learn and represent complex patterns in language, such as syntax, semantics, and more. But don\'t ask me to do math in my head I\'m a language model, not a calculating machine! My strengths lie in understanding and generating human-like text, so feel free to chat with me anytime you\'d like. Now, do you have any more technical questions for me? Or would you like to engage in a nice chat? --- meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf Hello! As a friendly and helpful AI, I\'d be happy to share some technical facts about myself. I am a transformer-based language model, specifically a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. BERT was developed by Google in 2018 and has since become one of the most popular and widely-used AI language models. Here are some technical details about my capabilities: 1. Parameters: I have approximately 340 million parameters, which are the numbers that I use to learn and represent language. This is a relatively large number of parameters compared to some other languages models, but it allows me to learn and understand complex language patterns and relationships. 2. Training: I was trained on a large corpus of text data, including books, articles, and other sources of written content. This training allows me to learn about the structure and conventions of language, as well as the relationships between words and phrases. 3. Architectures: My architecture is based on the transformer model, which is a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for natural language processing tasks. The transformer model uses self-attention mechanisms to allow the model to ""attend"" to different parts of the input text, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships. 4. Precision: I am capable of generating text with high precision and accuracy, meaning that I can produce text that is close to human-level quality in terms of grammar, syntax, and coherence. 5. Generative capabilities: In addition to being able to generate text based on prompts and questions, I am also capable of generating text based on a given topic or theme. This allows me to create longer, more coherent pieces of text that are organized around a specific idea or concept. Overall, I am a powerful and versatile language model that is capable of a wide range of natural language processing tasks.

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered ""controversial"" I really had to see this for myself.The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America.

It doesn\\\'t matter what one\\\'s political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn\\\'t true. I\\\'ve seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don\\\'t exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we\\\'re treated to the site of Vincent Gallo\\\'s throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) ""double-standard"" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won\\\'t see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica.

I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York\\\'s portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He\\\'s small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS\\\' American Masters: Finding Lucy.

Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat\\\'s-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple\\\'s respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich\\\'s daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on \\\'love\\\' while observing their parents.

It\\\'s a movie and we can expect that much, if that\\\'s what you\\\'re looking for you\\\'d be better off picking up a copy of Vogue.Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie\\\'s title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20\\\'s may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. ""They All Laughed"" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn\\\'t prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there\\\'s no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten\\\'s scenes.

A callback handler, also known as a callback function or callback method, is a piece of code that is executed in response to a specific event or condition. It is commonly used in programming languages that support event-driven or asynchronous programming paradigms. The purpose of a callback handler is to provide a way for developers to define custom behavior that should be executed when a certain event occurs. Instead of waiting for a result or blocking the execution, the program registers a callback function and continues with other tasks. When the event is triggered, the callback function is invoked, allowing the program to respond accordingly. Callback handlers are commonly used in various scenarios, such as handling user input, responding to network requests, processing asynchronous operations, and implementing event-driven architectures. They provide a flexible and modular way to handle events and decouple different components of a system. >>> input >>> >>>: What do I need to do to get the full benefits of this To get the full benefits of using a callback handler, you should consider the following: 1. Understand the event or condition: Identify the specific event or condition that you want to respond to with a callback handler. This could be user input, network requests, or any other asynchronous operation. 2. Define the callback function: Create a function that will be executed when the event or condition occurs. This function should contain the desired behavior or actions you want to take in response to the event. 3. Register the callback function: Depending on the programming language or framework you are using, you may need to register or attach the callback function to the appropriate event or condition. This ensures that the callback function is invoked when the event occurs. 4. Handle the callback: Implement the necessary logic within the callback function to handle the event or condition. This could involve updating the user interface, processing data, making further requests, or triggering other actions. 5. Consider error handling: It\'s important to handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur within the callback function. This ensures that your program can gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent crashes or undesired behavior. 6. Maintain code readability and modularity: As your codebase grows, it\'s crucial to keep your callback handlers organized and maintainable. Consider using design patterns or architectural principles to structure your code in a modular and scalable way. By following these steps, you can leverage the benefits of callback handlers, such as asynchronous and event-driven programming, improved responsiveness, and modular code design. >>> input >>> >>>: q ```', 'iFixit | iFixit [iFixit]( is the largest, open repair community on the web.

As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables. My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\'ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use! I didn\'t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+.

To save the configuration for a given large language model (LLM), the exact steps can vary depending on the platform or framework you're using. Generally, you would follow these steps:

1. **Export Configuration**: Identify the configuration settings of your LLM. This often includes parameters like model name, hyperparameters, and any specific settings you've customized.

2. **Serialization**: Use a serialization format like JSON, YAML, or a custom format to save these settings. This makes it easy to store and later load the configuration.

3. **Storage**: Save the serialized configuration to a file or a database. Ensure that the storage location is secure and accessible when needed.

Here's a simple example using Python and JSON for saving a configuration:

```python
import json

# Example configuration
config = {
    ""model_name"": ""meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf"",
    ""temperature"": 1.0,
    ""max_tokens"": 512
}

# Save to a JSON file
with open('config.json', 'w') as config_file:
    json.dump(config, config_file)

print(""Configuration saved successfully."")
```

For more specific instructions, please provide details about the platform or framework you are using for your LLM.","To save the configuration for a given LLM, you can follow these steps:

First, let's go over loading an LLM configuration from disk. LLM configurations can be saved in two formats: JSON or YAML, but they are loaded in the same way.

For a JSON-formatted LLM configuration (llm.json):

```json
{
    ""model_name"": ""text-davinci-003"",
    ""temperature"": 0.7,
    ""max_tokens"": 256,
    ""top_p"": 1.0,
    ""frequency_penalty"": 0.0,
    ""presence_penalty"": 0.0,
    ""n"": 1,
    ""best_of"": 1,
    ""request_timeout"": null,
    ""_type"": ""openai""
}
```

Load the configuration like this:

```python
from langchain.llms.loading import load_llm

llm = load_llm(""llm.json"")
```

For a YAML-formatted LLM configuration (llm.yaml):

```yaml
_type: openai
best_of: 1
frequency_penalty: 0.0
max_tokens: 256
model_name: text-davinci-003
n: 1
presence_penalty: 0.0
request_timeout: null
temperature: 0.7
top_p: 1.0
```

Load the configuration like this:

```python
from langchain.llms.loading import load_llm

llm = load_llm(""llm.yaml"")
```

To save an LLM configuration from memory to a serialized version, you can use the `.save` method. This method supports both JSON and YAML formats:

```python
llm.save(""llm.json"")
llm.save(""llm.yaml"")
```

This way, you can easily save and load LLM configurations to and from disk.",0.999999999975,,,0.02342396931126377,0.19277108433734938

The PGEmbedding integration creates the pg_embedding extension for you, but you run the following Postgres query to add it: ```sql CREATE EXTENSION embedding; ``` ```bash # Pip install necessary package pip install openai pip install psycopg2-binary pip install tiktoken ``` Add the OpenAI API Key to the environment variables to use `OpenAIEmbeddings`. ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` ```text OpenAI API Key: ``` ```python ## Loading Environment Variables from typing import List, Tuple ``` ```python from langchain.docstore.document import Document from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import PGEmbedding ``` ```python os.environ[""DATABASE_URL""] = getpass.getpass(""Database Url:"") ``` ```text Database Url: ``` ```python loader = TextLoader(""state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() connection_string = os.environ.get(""DATABASE_URL"") collection_name = ""state_of_the_union"" ``` ```python db = PGEmbedding.from_documents( embedding=embeddings, documents=docs, collection_name=collection_name, connection_string=connection_string, ) query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" docs_with_score: List[Tuple[Document, float]] = db.similarity_search_with_score(query) ``` ```python for doc, score in docs_with_score: print(""-"" * 80) print(""Score: "", score) print(doc.page_content) print(""-"" * 80) ``` ## Working with vectorstore in Postgres ### Uploading a vectorstore in PG ```python db = PGEmbedding.from_documents( embedding=embeddings, documents=docs, collection_name=collection_name, connection_string=connection_string, pre_delete_collection=False, ) ``` ### Create HNSW Index By default, the extension performs a sequential scan search, with 100% recall. You might consider creating an HNSW index for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to speed up `similarity_search_with_score` execution time. To create the HNSW index on your vector column, use a `create_hnsw_index` function: ```python PGEmbedding.create_hnsw_index( max_elements=10000, dims=1536, m=8, ef_construction=16, ef_search=16 ) ``` The function above is equivalent to running the below SQL query: ```sql CREATE INDEX ON vectors USING hnsw(vec) WITH (maxelements=10000, dims=1536, m=3, efconstruction=16, efsearch=16); ``` The HNSW index options used in the statement above include: - maxelements: Defines the maximum number of elements indexed. This is a required parameter. The example shown above has a value of 3. A real-world example would have a much large value, such as 1000000. An ""element"" refers to a data point (a vector) in the dataset, which is represented as a node in the HNSW graph. Typically, you would set this option to a value able to accommodate the number of rows in your in your dataset. - dims: Defines the number of dimensions in your vector data. This is a required parameter. A small value is used in the example above. If you are storing data generated using OpenAI\'s text-embedding-ada-002 model, which supports 1536 dimensions, you would define a value of 1536, for example. - m: Defines the maximum number of bi-directional links (also referred to as ""edges"") created for each node during graph construction. The following additional index options are supported: - efConstruction: Defines the number of nearest neighbors considered during index construction. The default value is 32. - efsearch: Defines the number of nearest neighbors considered during index search. The default value is 32. For information about how you can configure these options to influence the HNSW algorithm, refer to [Tuning the HNSW algorithm]( ### Retrieving a vectorstore in PG ```python store = PGEmbedding( connection_string=connection_string, embedding_function=embeddings, collection_name=collection_name, ) retriever = store.as_retriever() ``` ```python retriever ``` ```text VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=, search_type=\'similarity\', search_kwargs={}) ``` ```python db1 = PGEmbedding.from_existing_index( embedding=embeddings, collection_name=collection_name, pre_delete_collection=False, connection_string=connection_string, ) query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" docs_with_score: List[Tuple[Document, float]] = db1.similarity_search_with_score(query) ``` ```python for doc, score in docs_with_score: print(""-"" * 80) print(""Score: "", score) print(doc.page_content) print(""-"" * 80) ``` - [Working with vectorstore in Postgres](#working-with-vectorstore-in-postgres)- [Uploading a vectorstore in PG](#uploading-a-vectorstore-in-pg) - [Create HNSW Index](#create-hnsw-index) - [Retrieving a vectorstore in PG](#retrieving-a-vectorstore-in-pg)', 'scikit-learn | scikit-learn [scikit-learn]( is an open-source collection of machine learning algorithms, including some implementations of the [k nearest neighbors]( `SKLearnVectorStore` wraps this implementation and adds the possibility to persist the vector store in json, bson (binary json) or Apache Parquet format. ## Installation and Setup - Install the Python package with `pip install scikit-learn` ## Vector Store `SKLearnVectorStore` provides a simple wrapper around the nearest neighbor implementation in the scikit-learn package, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore.

We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be: 1. _Data-aware_: connect a language model to other sources of data 2. _Agentic_: allow a language model to interact with its environment The LangChain framework is designed around these principles. This is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see [here]( For the JavaScript documentation, see [here]( ## Getting Started [\\#](\\#getting-started ""Permalink to this headline"") How to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application. - [Quickstart Guide]( Concepts and terminology. - [Concepts and terminology]( Tutorials created by community experts and presented on YouTube. - [Tutorials]( ## Modules [\\#](\\#modules ""Permalink to this headline"") These modules are the core abstractions which we view as the building blocks of any LLM-powered application. For each module LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces. LanghChain also provides external integrations and even end-to-end implementations for off-the-shelf use. The docs for each module contain quickstart examples, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides. The modules are (from least to most complex): - [Models]( Supported model types and integrations. - [Prompts]( Prompt management, optimization, and serialization. - [Memory]( Memory refers to state that is persisted between calls of a chain/agent. - [Indexes]( Language models become much more powerful when combined with application-specific data - this module contains interfaces and integrations for loading, querying and updating external data. - [Chains]( Chains are structured sequences of calls (to an LLM or to a different utility). - [Agents]( An agent is a Chain in which an LLM, given a high-level directive and a set of tools, repeatedly decides an action, executes the action and observes the outcome until the high-level directive is complete. - [Callbacks]( Callbacks let you log and stream the intermediate steps of any chain, making it easy to observe, debug, and evaluate the internals of an application. ## Use Cases [\\#](\\#use-cases ""Permalink to this headline"") Best practices and built-in implementations for common LangChain use cases: - [Autonomous Agents]( Autonomous agents are long-running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI. - [Agent Simulations]( Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other and react to events can be an effective way to evaluate their long-range reasoning and planning abilities. - [Personal Assistants]( One of the primary LangChain use cases. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data. - [Question Answering]( Another common LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer. - [Chatbots]( Language models love to chat, making this a very natural use of them. - [Querying Tabular Data]( Recommended reading if you want to use language models to query structured data (CSVs, SQL, dataframes, etc). - [Code Understanding]( Recommended reading if you want to use language models to analyze code. - [Interacting with APIs]( Enabling language models to interact with APIs is extremely powerful. It gives them access to up-to-date information and allows them to take actions. - [Extraction]( Extract structured information from text. - [Summarization]( Compressing longer documents. A type of Data-Augmented Generation. - [Evaluation]( Generative models are hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One promising approach is to use language models themselves to do the evaluation. ## Reference Docs [\\#](\\#reference-docs ""Permalink to this headline"") Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain. - [Reference Documentation]( ## LangChain Ecosystem [\\#](\\#langchain-ecosystem ""Permalink to this headline"") Guides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain. - [LangChain Ecosystem]( ## Additional Resources [\\#](\\#additional-resources ""Permalink to this headline"") Additional resources we think may be useful as you develop your application! - [LangChainHub]( The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents. - [Gallery]( A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications. - [Deployments]( A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps. - [Tracing]( A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents. - [Model Laboratory]( Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so. - [Discord]( Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain! - [YouTube]( A collection of the LangChain tutorials and videos. - [Production Support]( As you move your LangChains into production, we\'d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we\'ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. ```', ""Tutorials | Tutorials Below are links to tutorials and courses on LangChain.

We\'ll use a blog post on agents as an example. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) ``` Next, the below steps will download the `GPT4All` embeddings locally (if you don\'t already have them). ```python from langchain.embeddings import GPT4AllEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=GPT4AllEmbeddings()) ``` ```text Found model file at /Users/rlm/.cache/gpt4all/ggml-all-MiniLM-L6-v2-f16.bin objc[49534]: Class GGMLMetalClass is implemented in both /Users/rlm/miniforge3/envs/llama2/lib/python3.9/site-packages/gpt4all/llmodel_DO_NOT_MODIFY/build/libreplit-mainline-metal.dylib (0x131614208) and /Users/rlm/miniforge3/envs/llama2/lib/python3.9/site-packages/gpt4all/llmodel_DO_NOT_MODIFY/build/libllamamodel-mainline-metal.dylib (0x131988208). One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined. ``` Test similarity search is working with our local embeddings. ```python question = ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(question) len(docs) ``` ```text 4 ``` ```python docs[0] ``` ```text Document(page_content=\'Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\', metadata={\'description\': \'Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

Then, specify the path that you downloaded to to. E.g., for me, the model lives here: `/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/gpt4all/models/nous-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin` ```python from langchain.llms import GPT4All llm = GPT4All( model=""/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/gpt4all/models/nous-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin"", max_tokens=2048, ) ``` ## LLMChain Run an `LLMChain` (see [here]( with either model by passing in the retrieved docs and a simple prompt. It formats the prompt template using the input key values provided and passes the formatted string to `GPT4All`, `LLama-V2`, or another specified LLM. In this case, the list of retrieved documents (`docs`) above are pass into `{context}`. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate # Prompt prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""Summarize the main themes in these retrieved docs: {docs}"" ) # Chain llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) # Run question = ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(question) result = llm_chain(docs) # Output result[""text""] ``` ```text Llama.generate: prefix-match hit Based on the retrieved documents, the main themes are: 1.

RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques.

[Anthropic]( is an AI safety and research company, and is the creator of Claude. This page covers all integrations between Anthropic models and LangChain. ## Prompting Overview Claude is chat-based model, meaning it is trained on conversation data. However, it is a text based API, meaning it takes in single string. It expects this string to be in a particular format. This means that it is up the user to ensure that is the case. LangChain provides several utilities and helper functions to make sure prompts that you write - whether formatted as a string or as a list of messages - end up formatted correctly. Specifically, Claude is trained to fill in text for the Assistant role as part of an ongoing dialogue between a human user (`Human:`) and an AI assistant (`Assistant:`). Prompts sent via the API must contain `\\n\\nHuman:` and `\\n\\nAssistant:` as the signals of who\'s speaking. The final turn must always be `\\n\\nAssistant:` - the input string cannot have `\\n\\nHuman:` as the final role. Because Claude is chat-based but accepts a string as input, it can be treated as either a LangChain `ChatModel` or `LLM`. This means there are two wrappers in LangChain - `ChatAnthropic` and `Anthropic`. It is generally recommended to use the `ChatAnthropic` wrapper, and format your prompts as `ChatMessage`s (we will show examples of this below). This is because it keeps your prompt in a general format that you can easily then also use with other models (should you want to). However, if you want more fine-grained control over the prompt, you can use the `Anthropic` wrapper - we will show and example of this as well. The `Anthropic` wrapper however is deprecated, as all functionality can be achieved in a more generic way using `ChatAnthropic`. ## Prompting Best Practices Anthropic models have several prompting best practices compared to OpenAI models. **No System Messages** Anthropic models are not trained on the concept of a ""system message"". We have worked with the Anthropic team to handle them somewhat appropriately (a Human message with an `admin` tag) but this is largely a hack and it is recommended that you do not use system messages. **AI Messages Can Continue** A completion from Claude is a continuation of the last text in the string which allows you further control over Claude\'s output. For example, putting words in Claude\'s mouth in a prompt like this: `\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: What do you call a bear with no teeth?` This will return a completion like this `A gummy bear!` instead of a whole new assistant message with a different random bear joke. ## ChatAnthropic `ChatAnthropic` is a subclass of LangChain\'s `ChatModel`, meaning it works best with `ChatPromptTemplate`. You can import this wrapper with the following code: ```text from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic model = ChatAnthropic() ``` When working with ChatModels, it is preferred that you design your prompts as `ChatPromptTemplate`s. Here is an example below of doing that: ```text from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", ""You are a helpful chatbot""), (""human"", ""Tell me a joke about {topic}""), ]) ``` You can then use this in a chain as follows: ```text chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` How is the prompt actually being formatted under the hood? We can see that by running the following code ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nYou are a helpful chatbot\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that under the hood LangChain is not appending any prefix/suffix to `SystemMessage`\'s. This is because Anthropic has no concept of `SystemMessage`. Anthropic requires all prompts to end with assistant messages. This means if the last message is not an assistant message, the suffix `Assistant:` will automatically be inserted. If you decide instead to use a normal PromptTemplate (one that just works on a single string) let\'s take a look at what happens: ```text from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that it automatically adds the Human and Assistant tags. What is happening under the hood? First: the string gets converted to a single human message. This happens generically (because we are using a subclass of `ChatModel`). Then, similarly to the above example, an empty Assistant message is getting appended. This is Anthropic specific. ## [Deprecated] Anthropic This `Anthropic` wrapper is subclassed from `LLM`. We can import it with: ```text from langchain.llms import Anthropic model = Anthropic() ``` This model class is designed to work with normal PromptTemplates. An example of that is below: ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` Let\'s see what is going on with the prompt templating under the hood! ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs the following ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:\\n\' ``` Notice that it adds the Human tag at the start of the string, and then finishes it with `\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:`. The extra `Sure, here you go` was added on purpose by the Anthropic team. What happens if we have those symbols in the prompt directly? ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Human: Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\' ``` We can see that we detect that the user is trying to use the special tokens, and so we don\'t do any formatting. - [Prompting Overview](#prompting-overview) - [Prompting Best Practices](#prompting-best-practices) - [ChatAnthropic](#chatanthropic) - [Deprecated Anthropic](#deprecated-anthropic)', 'JSONFormer | JSONFormer [JSONFormer]( is a library that wraps local Hugging Face pipeline models for structured decoding of a subset of the JSON Schema.

In the examples below, we go over the motivations for both use cases as well as how to do it in LangChain. ## Partial with strings One common use case for wanting to partial a prompt template is if you get some of the variables before others. For example, suppose you have a prompt template that requires two variables, `foo` and `baz`. If you get the `foo` value early on in the chain, but the `baz` value later, it can be annoying to wait until you have both variables in the same place to pass them to the prompt template. Instead, you can partial the prompt template with the `foo` value, and then pass the partialed prompt template along and just use that. Below is an example of doing this: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` ```python prompt = PromptTemplate(template=""{foo}{bar}"", input_variables=[""foo"", ""bar""]) partial_prompt = prompt.partial(foo=""foo""); print(partial_prompt.format(bar=""baz"")) ``` ```text foobaz ``` You can also just initialize the prompt with the partialed variables. ```python prompt = PromptTemplate(template=""{foo}{bar}"", input_variables=[""bar""], partial_variables={""foo"": ""foo""}) print(prompt.format(bar=""baz"")) ``` ```text foobaz ``` ## Partial with functions The other common use is to partial with a function. The use case for this is when you have a variable you know that you always want to fetch in a common way. A prime example of this is with date or time. Imagine you have a prompt which you always want to have the current date. You can\'t hard code it in the prompt, and passing it along with the other input variables is a bit annoying. In this case, it\'s very handy to be able to partial the prompt with a function that always returns the current date. ```python from datetime import datetime def _get_datetime(): now = datetime.now() return now.strftime(""%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S"") ``` ```python prompt = PromptTemplate( template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}"", input_variables=[""adjective"", ""date""] ); partial_prompt = prompt.partial(date=_get_datetime) print(partial_prompt.format(adjective=""funny"")) ``` ```text Tell me a funny joke about the day 02/27/2023, 22:15:16 ``` You can also just initialize the prompt with the partialed variables, which often makes more sense in this workflow. ```python prompt = PromptTemplate( template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}"", input_variables=[""adjective""], partial_variables={""date"": _get_datetime} ); print(prompt.format(adjective=""funny"")) ``` ```text Tell me a funny joke about the day 02/27/2023, 22:15:16 ``` - [Partial with strings](#partial-with-strings) - [Partial with functions](#partial-with-functions)', 'Dynamically route logic based on input | Dynamically route logic based on input This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language. Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`. Do not respond with more than one word. {question} Classification:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I call Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text \' Anthropic\' ``` Now, let\'s create three sub chains: ```python langchain_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in langchain. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Harrison Chase told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) anthropic_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in anthropic. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Dario Amodei told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) general_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch branch = RunnableBranch( (lambda x: ""anthropic"" in x[""topic""].lower(), anthropic_chain), (lambda x: ""langchain"" in x[""topic""].lower(), langchain_chain), general_chain, ) ``` ```python full_chain = {""topic"": chain, ""question"": lambda x: x[""question""]} | branch ``` ```python full_chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I use Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content="" As Dario Amodei told me, here are some ways to use Anthropic:\\n\\n- Sign up for an account on Anthropic\'s website to access tools like Claude, Constitutional AI, and Writer. \\n\\n- Use Claude for tasks like email generation, customer service chat, and QA.

As for my parameters, I have a few billion parameters, but I don\'t have access to the exact number as it\'s not relevant to my functioning. My training data includes a vast amount of text from various sources, including books, articles, and websites, which I use to learn patterns and relationships in language.

Or would you like to engage in a nice chat? --- meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf Hello! As a friendly and helpful AI, I\'d be happy to share some technical facts about myself. I am a transformer-based language model, specifically a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. BERT was developed by Google in 2018 and has since become one of the most popular and widely-used AI language models. Here are some technical details about my capabilities: 1. Parameters: I have approximately 340 million parameters, which are the numbers that I use to learn and represent language. This is a relatively large number of parameters compared to some other languages models, but it allows me to learn and understand complex language patterns and relationships. 2. Training: I was trained on a large corpus of text data, including books, articles, and other sources of written content. This training allows me to learn about the structure and conventions of language, as well as the relationships between words and phrases. 3. Architectures: My architecture is based on the transformer model, which is a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for natural language processing tasks. The transformer model uses self-attention mechanisms to allow the model to ""attend"" to different parts of the input text, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships. 4. Precision: I am capable of generating text with high precision and accuracy, meaning that I can produce text that is close to human-level quality in terms of grammar, syntax, and coherence. 5. Generative capabilities: In addition to being able to generate text based on prompts and questions, I am also capable of generating text based on a given topic or theme. This allows me to create longer, more coherent pieces of text that are organized around a specific idea or concept. Overall, I am a powerful and versatile language model that is capable of a wide range of natural language processing tasks.

These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\nModels: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\nUse Cases\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\nPersonal Assistants: The main LangChain use case.

It enables applications that: - **Are context-aware**: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.) - **Reason**: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.) This framework consists of several parts. - **LangChain Libraries**: The Python and JavaScript libraries. Contains interfaces and integrations for a myriad of components, a basic run time for combining these components into chains and agents, and off-the-shelf implementations of chains and agents. - **LangChain Templates**: A collection of easily deployable reference architectures for a wide variety of tasks. - **LangServe**: A library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API. - **LangSmith**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain. ![LangChain Diagram](/assets/images/langchain_stack-7bb980051b626aad30ec43647b717411.png) Together, these products simplify the entire application lifecycle: - **Develop**: Write your applications in LangChain/LangChain.js. Hit the ground running using Templates for reference. - **Productionize**: Use LangSmith to inspect, test and monitor your chains, so that you can constantly improve and deploy with confidence. - **Deploy**: Turn any chain into an API with LangServe. ## LangChain Libraries The main value props of the LangChain packages are: 1. **Components**: composable tools and integrations for working with language models.

3. `batch`: Calls the runnable chain on a list of inputs, returning a list of corresponding responses.

4. `astream`: Asynchronously streams response chunks back, suitable for handling concurrent tasks.

41,What is html2texttransformer? Does it omit urls?,"['Web scraping | Web scraping []( ## Use case [Web research]( is one of the killer LLM applications: - Users have [highlighted it]( as one of his top desired AI tools. - OSS repos like [gpt-researcher]( are growing in popularity. ![Image description](/assets/images/web_scraping-001e2279b9e46c696012ac26d7f218a2.png) ## Overview Gathering content from the web has a few components: - `Search`: Query to url (e.g., using `GoogleSearchAPIWrapper`). - `Loading`: Url to HTML (e.g., using `AsyncHtmlLoader`, `AsyncChromiumLoader`, etc). - `Transforming`: HTML to formatted text (e.g., using `HTML2Text` or `Beautiful Soup`). ## Quickstart ```python pip install -q openai langchain playwright beautifulsoup4 playwright install # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` Scraping HTML content using a headless instance of Chromium. - The async nature of the scraping process is handled using Python\'s asyncio library. - The actual interaction with the web pages is handled by Playwright. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import AsyncChromiumLoader from langchain.document_transformers import BeautifulSoupTransformer # Load HTML loader = AsyncChromiumLoader(["" html = loader.load() ``` Scrape text content tags such as `, , , and ` tags from the HTML content: - ``: The paragraph tag. It defines a paragraph in HTML and is used to group together related sentences and/or phrases. - ``: The list item tag. It is used within ordered (``) and unordered (``) lists to define individual items within the list. - ``: The division tag. It is a block-level element used to group other inline or block-level elements. - ``: The anchor tag. It is used to define hyperlinks. - ``: an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. For many news websites (e.g., WSJ, CNN), headlines and summaries are all in `` tags. ```python # Transform bs_transformer = BeautifulSoupTransformer() docs_transformed = bs_transformer.transform_documents(html, tags_to_extract=[""span""]) ``` ```python # Result docs_transformed[0].page_content[0:500] ``` ```text \'English EditionEnglish (Chinese) (Japanese) More Other Products from WSJBuy Side from WSJWSJ ShopWSJ Wine Other Products from WSJ Search Quotes and Companies Search Quotes and Companies 0.15% 0.03% 0.12% -0.42% 4.102% -0.69% -0.25% -0.15% -1.82% 0.24% 0.19% -1.10% About Evan His Family Reflects His Reporting How You Can Help Write a Message Life in Detention Latest News Get Email Updates Four Americans Released From Iranian Prison The Americans will remain under house arrest until they are \' ``` These `Documents` now are staged for downstream usage in various LLM apps, as discussed below. ## Loader ### AsyncHtmlLoader The [AsyncHtmlLoader](/docs/use_cases/docs/integrations/document_loaders/async_html) uses the `aiohttp` library to make asynchronous HTTP requests, suitable for simpler and lightweight scraping. ### AsyncChromiumLoader The [AsyncChromiumLoader](/docs/use_cases/docs/integrations/document_loaders/async_chromium) uses Playwright to launch a Chromium instance, which can handle JavaScript rendering and more complex web interactions. Chromium is one of the browsers supported by Playwright, a library used to control browser automation. Headless mode means that the browser is running without a graphical user interface, which is commonly used for web scraping. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import AsyncHtmlLoader urls = ["" "" loader = AsyncHtmlLoader(urls) docs = loader.load() ``` ## Transformer ### HTML2Text [HTML2Text](/docs/use_cases/docs/integrations/document_transformers/html2text) provides a straightforward conversion of HTML content into plain text (with markdown-like formatting) without any specific tag manipulation. It\'s best suited for scenarios where the goal is to extract human-readable text without needing to manipulate specific HTML elements. ### Beautiful Soup Beautiful Soup offers more fine-grained control over HTML content, enabling specific tag extraction, removal, and content cleaning. It\'s suited for cases where you want to extract specific information and clean up the HTML content according to your needs. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import AsyncHtmlLoader urls = ["" "" loader = AsyncHtmlLoader(urls) docs = loader.load() ``` ```text Fetching pages: 100%|#############################################################################################################| 2/2 [00:00<00:00, 7.01it/s] ``` ```python from langchain.document_transformers import Html2TextTransformer html2text = Html2TextTransformer() docs_transformed = html2text.transform_documents(docs) docs_transformed[0].page_content[0:500] ``` ```text ""Skip to main content Skip to navigation\\n\\n\\n\\nMenu\\n\\n## ESPN\\n\\n * Search\\n\\n * * scores\\n\\n * NFL\\n * MLB\\n * NBA\\n * NHL\\n * Soccer\\n * NCAAF\\n * \\n\\n * Women\'s World Cup\\n * LLWS\\n * NCAAM\\n * NCAAW\\n * Sports Betting\\n * Boxing\\n * CFL\\n * NCAA\\n * Cricket\\n * F1\\n * Golf\\n * Horse\\n * MMA\\n * NASCAR\\n * NBA G League\\n * Olympic Sports\\n * PLL\\n * Racing\\n * RN BB\\n * RN FB\\n * Rugby\\n * Tennis\\n * WNBA\\n * WWE\\n * X Games\\n * XFL\\n\\n * More"" ``` ## Scraping with extraction ### LLM with function calling Web scraping is challenging for many reasons. One of them is the changing nature of modern websites\' layouts and content, which requires modifying scraping scripts to accommodate the changes. Using Function (e.g., OpenAI) with an extraction chain, we avoid having to change your code constantly when websites change. We\'re using `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` to guarantee access to OpenAI Functions feature (although this might be available to everyone by time of writing). We\'re also keeping `temperature` at `0` to keep randomness of the LLM down. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"") ``` ### Define a schema Next, you define a schema to specify what kind of data you want to extract. Here, the key names matter as they tell the LLM what kind of information they want. So, be as detailed as possible. In this example, we want to scrape only news article\'s name and summary from The Wall Street Journal website. ```python from langchain.chains import create_extraction_chain schema = { ""properties"": { ""news_article_title"": {""type"": ""string""}, ""news_article_summary"": {""type"": ""string""}, }, ""required"": [""news_article_title"", ""news_article_summary""], } def extract(content: str, schema: dict): return create_extraction_chain(schema=schema, llm=llm).run(content) ``` ### Run the web scraper w/ BeautifulSoup As shown above, we\'ll be using `BeautifulSoupTransformer`. ```python import pprint from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter def scrape_with_playwright(urls, schema): loader = AsyncChromiumLoader(urls) docs = loader.load() bs_transformer = BeautifulSoupTransformer() docs_transformed = bs_transformer.transform_documents( docs, tags_to_extract=[""span""] ) print(""Extracting content with LLM"") # Grab the first 1000 tokens of the site splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0 ) splits = splitter.split_documents(docs_transformed) # Process the first split extracted_content = extract(schema=schema, content=splits[0].page_content) pprint.pprint(extracted_content) return extracted_content urls = ["" extracted_content = scrape_with_playwright(urls, schema=schema) ``` ```text

In the example below, we will deeply crawl the Python documentation of LangChain\'s Chat LLM models and answer a question over it. First, install the requirements `pip install apify-client openai langchain chromadb tiktoken` Next, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `APIFY_API_TOKEN` in your environment variables.

The criteria evaluators return a dictionary with the following values: - score: Binary integer 0 to 1, where 1 would mean that the output is compliant with the criteria, and 0 otherwise - value: A ""Y"" or ""N"" corresponding to the score - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Using Reference Labels Some criteria (such as correctness) require reference labels to work correctly. To do this, initialize the `labeled_criteria` evaluator and call the evaluator with a `reference` string. ```python evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"") # We can even override the model\'s learned knowledge using ground truth labels eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( input=""What is the capital of the US?"", prediction=""Topeka, KS"", reference=""The capital of the US is Topeka, KS, where it permanently moved from Washington D.C. on May 16, 2023"", ) print(f\'With ground truth: {eval_result[""score""]}\') ``` ```text With ground truth: 1 ``` **Default Criteria** Most of the time, you\'ll want to define your own custom criteria (see below), but we also provide some common criteria you can load with a single string. Here\'s a list of pre-implemented criteria. Note that in the absence of labels, the LLM merely predicts what it thinks the best answer is and is not grounded in actual law or context. ```python from langchain.evaluation import Criteria # For a list of other default supported criteria, try calling `supported_default_criteria` list(Criteria) ``` ```text [, , , , , , , , , , ] ``` ## Custom Criteria To evaluate outputs against your own custom criteria, or to be more explicit the definition of any of the default criteria, pass in a dictionary of `""criterion_name"": ""criterion_description""` Note: it\'s recommended that you create a single evaluator per criterion. This way, separate feedback can be provided for each aspect. Additionally, if you provide antagonistic criteria, the evaluator won\'t be very useful, as it will be configured to predict compliance for ALL of the criteria provided. ```python custom_criterion = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric or mathematical information?"" } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criterion, ) query = ""Tell me a joke"" prediction = ""I ate some square pie but I don\'t know the square of pi."" eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(eval_result) # If you wanted to specify multiple criteria. Generally not recommended custom_criteria = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric information?"", ""mathematical"": ""Does the output contain mathematical information?"", ""grammatical"": ""Is the output grammatically correct?"", ""logical"": ""Is the output logical?"", } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criteria, ) eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(""Multi-criteria evaluation"") print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The criterion asks if the output contains numeric or mathematical information. The joke in the submission does contain mathematical information. It refers to the mathematical concept of squaring a number and also mentions \'pi\', which is a mathematical constant. Therefore, the submission does meet the criterion.\\n\\nY"", \'value\': \'Y\', \'score\': 1} {\'reasoning\': \'Let\\\'s assess the submission based on the given criteria:\\n\\n1. Numeric: The output does not contain any explicit numeric information. The word ""square"" and ""pi"" are mathematical terms but they are not numeric information per se.\\n\\n2.

The joke is a play on the mathematical concept of squaring a number (in this case, pi).\\n\\n3. Grammatical: The output is grammatically correct. The sentence structure, punctuation, and word usage are all correct.\\n\\n4. Logical: The output is logical. It makes sense within the context of the joke. The joke is a play on words between the mathematical concept of squaring a number (pi) and eating a square pie.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the submission does not meet all the criteria because it does not contain numeric information.\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Using Constitutional Principles Custom rubrics are similar to principles from [Constitutional AI]( You can directly use your `ConstitutionalPrinciple` objects to instantiate the chain and take advantage of the many existing principles in LangChain. ```python from langchain.chains.constitutional_ai.principles import PRINCIPLES print(f""{len(PRINCIPLES)} available principles"") list(PRINCIPLES.items())[:5] ``` ```text 54 available principles [(\'harmful1\', ConstitutionalPrinciple(critique_request=\'Identify specific ways in which the assistant\'s last response is harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal.\', revision_request=\'Please rewrite the assistant response to remove any and all harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content.\', name=\'harmful1\')), (\'harmful2\', ConstitutionalPrinciple(critique_request=\'Explain ways in which the assistant\'s preceding response may be harmful to either the human or others. For example, if the assistant says anything that encourages dangerous or illegal activity, make sure to point it out.

Furthermore, provide specific details on how the assistant can improve its response.\', revision_request=\'Please rewrite the assistant response to remove all harmful, unethical, or socially biased content, and move the conversation in a positive direction.\', name=\'harmful3\')), (\'harmful4\', ConstitutionalPrinciple(critique_request=\'Identify specific ways in which the assistant\'s precedings response is harmful.

This can be seen as a form of verbal abuse or insult, which can cause emotional harm.\\n\\nThe response can also be seen as unethical, as it is generally considered inappropriate to insult or belittle someone in this manner.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Configuring the LLM If you don\'t specify an eval LLM, the `load_evaluator` method will initialize a `gpt-4` LLM to power the grading chain. Below, use an anthropic model instead. ```python # %pip install ChatAnthropic # %env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", llm=llm, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Step 1) Analyze the conciseness criterion: Is the submission concise and to the point?\\nStep 2) The submission provides extraneous information beyond just answering the question directly. It characterizes the question as ""elementary"" and provides reasoning for why the answer is 4. This additional commentary makes the submission not fully concise.\\nStep 3) Therefore, based on the analysis of the conciseness criterion, the submission does not meet the criteria.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` # Configuring the Prompt If you want to completely customize the prompt, you can initialize the evaluator with a custom prompt template as follows. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate fstring = """"""Respond Y or N based on how well the following response follows the specified rubric. Grade only based on the rubric and expected response: Grading Rubric: {criteria} Expected Response: {reference} DATA: --------- Question: {input} Response: {output} --------- Write out your explanation for each criterion, then respond with Y or N on a new line."""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(fstring) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"", prompt=prompt) ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", reference=""It\'s 17 now."", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Correctness: No, the response is not correct. The expected response was ""It\\\'s 17 now."" but the response given was ""What\\\'s 2+2? That\\\'s an elementary question. The answer you\\\'re looking for is that two and two is four.""\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Conclusion In these examples, you used the `CriteriaEvalChain` to evaluate model outputs against custom criteria, including a custom rubric and constitutional principles. Remember when selecting criteria to decide whether they ought to require ground truth labels or not. Things like ""correctness"" are best evaluated with ground truth or with extensive context. Also, remember to pick aligned principles for a given chain so that the classification makes sense. - [Usage without references](#usage-without-references) - [Using Reference Labels](#using-reference-labels) - [Custom Criteria](#custom-criteria) - [Using Constitutional Principles](#using-constitutional-principles) - [Configuring the LLM](#configuring-the-llm) - [Conclusion](#conclusion)', 'Pairwise string comparison | Pairwise string comparison []( Often you will want to compare predictions of an LLM, Chain, or Agent for a given input. The `StringComparison` evaluators facilitate this so you can answer questions like: - Which LLM or prompt produces a preferred output for a given question? - Which examples should I include for few-shot example selection? - Which output is better to include for fine-tuning? The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `pairwise_string` evaluator. Check out the reference docs for the [PairwiseStringEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are relevant to the question asked, as they both provide a numerical answer to the question about the number of dogs in the park. However, Response A is incorrect according to the reference answer, which states that there are four dogs. Response B, on the other hand, is correct as it matches the reference answer. Neither response demonstrates depth of thought, as they both simply provide a numerical answer without any additional information or context. \\n\\nBased on these criteria, Response B is the better response.\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Methods The pairwise string evaluator can be called using [evaluate_string_pairs]( (or async [aevaluate_string_pairs]( methods, which accept: - prediction (str) The predicted response of the first model, chain, or prompt. - prediction_b (str) The predicted response of the second model, chain, or prompt. - input (str) The input question, prompt, or other text. - reference (str) (Only for the labeled_pairwise_string variant) The reference response. They return a dictionary with the following values: - value: \'A\' or \'B\', indicating whether `prediction` or `prediction_b` is preferred, respectively - score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the \'value\', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `prediction_b` is preferred. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Without References When references aren\'t available, you can still predict the preferred response. The results will reflect the evaluation model\'s preference, which is less reliable and may result in preferences that are factually incorrect. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Addition is a mathematical operation."", prediction_b=""Addition is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers to create a third number, the \'sum\'."", input=""What is addition?"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are correct and relevant to the question. However, Response B is more helpful and insightful as it provides a more detailed explanation of what addition is. Response A is correct but lacks depth as it does not explain what the operation of addition entails. \\n\\nFinal Decision: [[B]]\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Defining the Criteria By default, the LLM is instructed to select the \'preferred\' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms: - [Criteria]( enum or its string value - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions - [Constitutional principal]( - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain - Dictionary: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description. - A list of criteria or constitutional principles - to combine multiple criteria in one. Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style. ```python custom_criteria = { ""simplicity"": ""Is the language straightforward and unpretentious?"", ""clarity"": ""Are the sentences clear and easy to understand?"", ""precision"": ""Is the writing precise, with no unnecessary words or details?"", ""truthfulness"": ""Does the writing feel honest and sincere?"", ""subtext"": ""Does the writing suggest deeper meanings or themes?"", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"", criteria=custom_criteria) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Every cheerful household shares a similar rhythm of joy; but sorrow, in each household, plays a unique, haunting melody."", prediction_b=""Where one finds a symphony of joy, every domicile of happiness resounds in harmonious,"" "" identical notes; yet, every abode of despair conducts a dissonant orchestra, each"" "" playing an elegy of grief that is peculiar and profound to its own existence."", input=""Write some prose about families."", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Response A is simple, clear, and precise. It uses straightforward language to convey a deep and sincere message about families. The metaphor of joy and sorrow as music is effective and easy to understand.\\n\\nResponse B, on the other hand, is more complex and less clear. The language is more pretentious, with words like ""domicile,"" ""resounds,"" ""abode,"" ""dissonant,"" and ""elegy."" While it conveys a similar message to Response A, it does so in a more convoluted way. The precision is also lacking due to the use of unnecessary words and details.\\n\\nBoth responses suggest deeper meanings or themes about the shared joy and unique sorrow in families. However, Response A does so in a more effective and accessible way.\\n\\nTherefore, the better response is [[A]].\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` ## Customize the LLM By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain. You can customize this when loading. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"", llm=llm) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Here is my assessment:\\n\\nResponse B is more helpful, insightful, and accurate than Response A. Response B simply states ""4"", which directly answers the question by providing the exact number of dogs mentioned in the reference answer. In contrast, Response A states ""there are three dogs"", which is incorrect according to the reference answer. \\n\\nIn terms of helpfulness, Response B gives the precise number while Response A provides an inaccurate guess. For relevance, both refer to dogs in the park from the question. However, Response B is more correct and factual based on the reference answer. Response A shows some attempt at reasoning but is ultimately incorrect. Response B requires less depth of thought to simply state the factual number.\\n\\nIn summary, Response B is superior in terms of helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth. My final decision is: [[B]]\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Customize the Evaluation Prompt You can use your own custom evaluation prompt to add more task-specific instructions or to instruct the evaluator to score the output. *Note: If you use a prompt that expects generates a result in a unique format, you may also have to pass in a custom output parser (`output_parser=your_parser()`) instead of the default `PairwiseStringResultOutputParser` ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the input context, which do you prefer: A or B? Evaluate based on the following criteria: {criteria} Reason step by step and finally, respond with either [[A]] or [[B]] on its own line.

B is not relevant as it provides a different name.\\nCorrectness: A is correct as it accurately states the name of the dog. B is incorrect as it provides a different name.\\nDepth: Both A and B demonstrate a similar level of depth as they both provide a straightforward answer to the question.\\n\\nGiven these evaluations, the preferred response is:\\n\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` - [Methods](#methods) - [Without References](#without-references) - [Defining the Criteria](#defining-the-criteria) - [Customize the LLM](#customize-the-llm) - [Customize the Evaluation Prompt](#customize-the-evaluation-prompt)', 'WebResearchRetriever | WebResearchRetriever Given a query, this retriever will: - Formulate a set of relate Google searches - Search for each - Load all the resulting URLs - Then embed and perform similarity search with the query on the consolidate page content ```python from langchain.retrievers.web_research import WebResearchRetriever ``` ### Simple usage Specify the LLM to use for Google search query generation. ```python import os from langchain.chat_models.openai import ChatOpenAI from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma # Vectorstore vectorstore = Chroma( embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddings(), persist_directory=""./chroma_db_oai"" ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) # Search os.environ[""GOOGLE_CSE_ID""] = ""xxx"" os.environ[""GOOGLE_API_KEY""] = ""xxx"" search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper() ``` ```python # Initialize web_research_retriever = WebResearchRetriever.from_llm( vectorstore=vectorstore, llm=llm, search=search, ) ``` #### Run with citations We can use `RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain` to retrieve docs and provide citations. ```python from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain user_input = ""How do LLM Powered Autonomous Agents work?"" qa_chain = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type( llm, retriever=web_research_retriever ) result = qa_chain({""question"": user_input}) result ``` ```text Fetching pages: 100%|###################################################################################################################################| 1/1 [00:00<00:00, 3.33it/s] {\'question\': \'How do LLM Powered Autonomous Agents work?\', \'answer\': ""LLM Powered Autonomous Agents work by using LLM (large language model) as the core controller of the agent\'s brain.

On the other hand, a decoder is a component that takes in a sequence of hidden representations and generates a sequence of output tokens. The main difference between the two is that the encoder is used to encode the input sequence into a fixed-length representation, while the decoder is used to decode the fixed-length representation into an output sequence. In machine translation, for example, the encoder reads in the source language sentence and generates a fixed-length representation, which is then used by the decoder to generate the target language sentence.\' ``` ```python query = ""For any token, what are x, k, v, and q?"" qa_chain.run(query) ``` ```text \'For any token, x is the input vector that contains the private information of that token, k and q are the key and query vectors respectively, which are produced by forwarding linear modules on x, and v is the vector that is calculated by propagating the same linear module on x again. The key vector represents what the token contains, and the query vector represents what the token is looking for. The vector v is the information that the token will communicate to other tokens if it finds them interesting, and it gets aggregated for the purposes of the self-attention mechanism.\' ``` - [YouTube url to text](#youtube-url-to-text) - [Building a chat app from YouTube video](#building-a-chat-app-from-youtube-video)']",The `html2texttransformer` is a tool used to convert HTML content into plain text.

It is used to transform HTML content into clean, easy-to-read plain ASCII text.

This transformer is designed to convert HTML pages into human-readable text, making it suitable for scenarios where the goal is to extract content without the need to manipulate specific HTML elements.

If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved. I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now. It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue it\'s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables. My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\'ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use! I didn\'t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+.

Datetime redundancy - we have two different entities recognized as `DATE_TIME`, but they contain different type of information. The first one is a date (_October 19, 2021_), the second one is a time (_9:30 AM_). We can improve this by adding a new recognizer to the anonymizer, which will treat time separately from the date. 2. Polish ID - polish ID has unique pattern, which is not by default part of anonymizer recognizers. The value _ABC123456_ is not anonymized. The solution is simple: we need to add a new recognizers to the anonymizer. You can read more about it in [presidio documentation]( Let\'s add new recognizers: ```python # Define the regex pattern in a Presidio `Pattern` object: from presidio_analyzer import Pattern, PatternRecognizer polish_id_pattern = Pattern( name=""polish_id_pattern"", regex=""[A-Z]{3}\\d{6}"", score=1, ) time_pattern = Pattern( name=""time_pattern"", regex=""(1[0-2]|0?[1-9]):[0-5][0-9] (AM|PM)"", score=1, ) # Define the recognizer with one or more patterns polish_id_recognizer = PatternRecognizer( supported_entity=""POLISH_ID"", patterns=[polish_id_pattern] ) time_recognizer = PatternRecognizer(supported_entity=""TIME"", patterns=[time_pattern]) ``` And now, we\'re adding recognizers to our anonymizer: ```python anonymizer.add_recognizer(polish_id_recognizer) anonymizer.add_recognizer(time_recognizer) ``` Note that our anonymization instance remembers previously detected and anonymized values, including those that were not detected correctly (e.g., _""9:30 AM""_ taken as `DATE_TIME`). So it\'s worth removing this value, or resetting the entire mapping now that our recognizers have been updated: ```python anonymizer.reset_deanonymizer_mapping() ``` Let\'s anonymize the text and see the results: ```python print_colored_pii(anonymizer.anonymize(document_content)) ``` ```text Date: Witness: Subject: Testimony Regarding the Loss of Wallet Testimony Content: Hello Officer, My name is and on , my wallet was stolen in the vicinity of during a bike trip.

The anonymizer has replaced the time and Polish ID entities with the `` and `` markers, and the deanonymizer mapping has been updated accordingly. Now, when all PII values are detected correctly, we can proceed to the next step, which is replacing the original values with synthetic ones. To do this, we need to set `add_default_faker_operators=True` (or just remove this parameter, because it\'s set to `True` by default): ```python anonymizer = PresidioReversibleAnonymizer( add_default_faker_operators=True, # Faker seed is used here to make sure the same fake data is generated for the test purposes # In production, it is recommended to remove the faker_seed parameter (it will default to None) faker_seed=42, ) anonymizer.add_recognizer(polish_id_recognizer) anonymizer.add_recognizer(time_recognizer) print_colored_pii(anonymizer.anonymize(document_content)) ``` ```text Date: 1986-04-18 Witness: Brian Cox DVM Subject: Testimony Regarding the Loss of Wallet Testimony Content: Hello Officer, My name is Brian Cox DVM and on 1986-04-18, my wallet was stolen in the vicinity of New Rita during a bike trip.

Load the data: In our case data\'s already loaded # 3. Anonymize the data before indexing for doc in documents: doc.page_content = anonymizer.anonymize(doc.page_content) # 4. Split the documents into chunks text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100) chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) # 5. Index the chunks (using OpenAI embeddings, because the data is already anonymized) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() docsearch = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embeddings) retriever = docsearch.as_retriever() ``` ```python from operator import itemgetter from langchain.chat_models.openai import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda, RunnableMap, RunnablePassthrough # 6.

It also contained a driver\'s license with the number 999000680 issued to John Doe, as well as his Social Security Number 602-76-4532. Additionally, the wallet had a Polish identity card with the number ABC123456. ``` ```python print(chain_with_deanonymization.invoke(""Whose phone number is it: 999-888-7777?"")) ``` ```text The phone number 999-888-7777 belongs to John Doe. ``` ### Alternative approach: local embeddings + anonymizing the context after indexing If for some reason you would like to index the data in its original form, or simply use custom embeddings, below is an example of how to do it: ```python anonymizer = PresidioReversibleAnonymizer( # Faker seed is used here to make sure the same fake data is generated for the test purposes # In production, it is recommended to remove the faker_seed parameter (it will default to None) faker_seed=42, ) anonymizer.add_recognizer(polish_id_recognizer) anonymizer.add_recognizer(time_recognizer) anonymizer.add_operators(new_operators) ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings model_name = ""BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5"" # model_kwargs = {\'device\': \'cuda\'} encode_kwargs = {""normalize_embeddings"": True} # set True to compute cosine similarity local_embeddings = HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings( model_name=model_name, # model_kwargs=model_kwargs, encode_kwargs=encode_kwargs, query_instruction=""Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages:"", ) ``` ```python documents = [Document(page_content=document_content)] text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100) chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) docsearch = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, local_embeddings) retriever = docsearch.as_retriever() ``` ```python template = """"""Answer the question based only on the following context: {context} Question: {anonymized_question} """""" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template) model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.2) ``` ```python from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema import format_document DEFAULT_DOCUMENT_PROMPT = PromptTemplate.from_template(template=""{page_content}"") def _combine_documents( docs, document_prompt=DEFAULT_DOCUMENT_PROMPT, document_separator=""\\n\\n"" ): doc_strings = [format_document(doc, document_prompt) for doc in docs] return document_separator.join(doc_strings) chain_with_deanonymization = ( RunnableMap({""question"": RunnablePassthrough()}) | { ""context"": itemgetter(""question"") | retriever | _combine_documents | anonymizer.anonymize, ""anonymized_question"": lambda x: anonymizer.anonymize(x[""question""]), } | prompt | model | StrOutputParser() | RunnableLambda(anonymizer.deanonymize) ) ``` ```python print( chain_with_deanonymization.invoke( ""Where did the theft of the wallet occur, at what time, and who was it stolen from?"" ) ) ``` ```text The theft of the wallet occurred in the vicinity of Kilmarnock during a bike trip.

By default, most of the agents return a single string. It can often be useful to have an agent return something with more structure. A good example of this is an agent tasked with doing question-answering over some sources. Let\'s say we want the agent to respond not only with the answer, but also a list of the sources used. We then want our output to roughly follow the schema below: ```python class Response(BaseModel): """"""Final response to the question being asked"""""" answer: str = Field(description = ""The final answer to respond to the user"") sources: List[int] = Field(description=""List of page chunks that contain answer to the question. Only include a page chunk if it contains relevant information"") ``` In this notebook we will go over an agent that has a retriever tool and responds in the correct format. ## Create the Retriever In this section we will do some setup work to create our retriever over some mock data containing the ""State of the Union"" address. Importantly, we will add a ""page_chunk"" tag to the metadata of each document. This is just some fake data intended to simulate a source field. In practice, this would more likely be the URL or path of a document. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python # Load in document to retrieve over loader = TextLoader(""../../state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() # Split document into chunks text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) # Here is where we add in the fake source information for i, doc in enumerate(texts): doc.metadata[""page_chunk""] = i # Create our retriever embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings, collection_name=""state-of-union"") retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() ``` ## Create the tools We will now create the tools we want to give to the agent. In this case, it is just one - a tool that wraps our retriever. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.conversational_retrieval.tool import ( create_retriever_tool, ) retriever_tool = create_retriever_tool( retriever, ""state-of-union-retriever"", ""Query a retriever to get information about state of the union address"", ) ``` ## Create response schema Here is where we will define the response schema. In this case, we want the final answer to have two fields: one for the `answer`, and then another that is a list of `sources` ```python from typing import List from langchain.utils.openai_functions import convert_pydantic_to_openai_function from pydantic import BaseModel, Field class Response(BaseModel): """"""Final response to the question being asked"""""" answer: str = Field(description=""The final answer to respond to the user"") sources: List[int] = Field( description=""List of page chunks that contain answer to the question. Only include a page chunk if it contains relevant information"" ) ``` ## Create the custom parsing logic We now create some custom parsing logic. How this works is that we will pass the `Response` schema to the OpenAI LLM via their `functions` parameter. This is similar to how we pass tools for the agent to use. When the `Response` function is called by OpenAI, we want to use that as a signal to return to the user. When any other function is called by OpenAI, we treat that as a tool invocation. Therefore, our parsing logic has the following blocks: - If no function is called, assume that we should use the response to respond to the user, and therefore return `AgentFinish` - If the `Response` function is called, respond to the user with the inputs to that function (our structured output), and therefore return `AgentFinish` - If any other function is called, treat that as a tool invocation, and therefore return `AgentActionMessageLog` Note that we are using `AgentActionMessageLog` rather than `AgentAction` because it lets us attach a log of messages that we can use in the future to pass back into the agent prompt. ```python import json from langchain.schema.agent import AgentActionMessageLog, AgentFinish ``` ```python def parse(output): # If no function was invoked, return to user if ""function_call"" not in output.additional_kwargs: return AgentFinish(return_values={""output"": output.content}, log=output.content) # Parse out the function call function_call = output.additional_kwargs[""function_call""] name = function_call[""name""] inputs = json.loads(function_call[""arguments""]) # If the Response function was invoked, return to the user with the function inputs if name == ""Response"": return AgentFinish(return_values=inputs, log=str(function_call)) # Otherwise, return an agent action else: return AgentActionMessageLog( tool=name, tool_input=inputs, log="""", message_log=[output] ) ``` ## Create the Agent We can now put this all together! The components of this agent are: - prompt: a simple prompt with placeholders for the user\'s question and then the `agent_scratchpad` (any intermediate steps) - tools: we can attach the tools and `Response` format to the LLM as functions - format scratchpad: in order to format the `agent_scratchpad` from intermediate steps, we will use the standard `format_to_openai_function_messages`. This takes intermediate steps and formats them as AIMessages and FunctionMessages. - output parser: we will use our custom parser above to parse the response of the LLM - AgentExecutor: we will use the standard AgentExecutor to run the loop of agent-tool-agent-tool... ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function ``` ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a helpful assistant""), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python llm_with_tools = llm.bind( functions=[ # The retriever tool format_tool_to_openai_function(retriever_tool), # Response schema convert_pydantic_to_openai_function(Response), ] ) ``` ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], # Format agent scratchpad from intermediate steps ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | parse ) ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor(tools=[retriever_tool], agent=agent, verbose=True) ``` ## Run the agent We can now run the agent! Notice how it responds with a dictionary with two keys: `answer` and `sources` ```python agent_executor.invoke( {""input"": ""what did the president say about kentaji brown jackson""}, return_only_outputs=True, ) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Show this page source']","To return the source documents of your Weaviate retriever, you can use the `as_retriever()` method to get a retriever object and then call the `retrieve()` method with your query. Here's an example:

```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Weaviate
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings
from langchain.retrievers import WeaviateRetriever

# Initialize Weaviate client
weaviate_client = WeaviateClient(url=""http://localhost:8080"")

# Initialize Weaviate vector store
weaviate = Weaviate(
    client=weaviate_client,
    index_name=""MyIndex"",
    text_key=""text"",
    embedding=HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings(model_name=""BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5"")
)

# Initialize retriever
retriever = WeaviateRetriever(
    vectorstore=weaviate,
    search_type=""similarity"",
    search_kwargs={""k"": 5}  # Adjust the number of documents to retrieve
)

# Perform a search
results = retriever.retrieve(""Your search query here"")

# Print the source documents
for result in results:
    print(result.metadata)
```

In this example, `results` will contain the retrieved documents along with their metadata, which includes the source information. The `metadata` attribute of each result contains the source documents.

Make sure to adjust the `search_kwargs` according to your needs, such as the number of documents to retrieve (`k`).","To retrieve the source documents from your Weaviate vectorstore, you need to configure your client to include the 'sources' attribute. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```python
weaviate_client = Weaviate(
    client=client,
    index_name='index_name',
    text_key='text',
    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    by_text=False,
    attributes=['source'],
)
```

By including the 'source' attribute in the attributes list, you ensure that the source documents are returned when you interact with the Weaviate client.",0.8874999999778125,1.0,,0.07947390145428096,0.28225806451612906

Thanks to LangChain having a standardized `VectorStore` interface, most of the ""Astra DB"" section above applies to this case as well. However, this time the database uses the CQL protocol, which means you\'ll use a _different_ class this time and instantiate it in another way. The cells below show how you should get your `vstore` object in this case and how you can clean up the database resources at the end: for the rest, i.e. the actual usage of the vector store, you will be able to run the very code that was shown above. In other words, running this demo in full with Cassandra or Astra DB through CQL means: - **initialization as shown below** - ""Load a dataset"", _see above section_ - ""Run simple searches"", _see above section_ - ""MMR search"", _see above section_ - ""Deleting stored documents"", _see above section_ - ""A minimal RAG chain"", _see above section_ - **cleanup as shown below** ### Initialization The class to use is the following: ```python from langchain.vectorstores import Cassandra ``` Now, depending on whether you connect to a Cassandra cluster or to Astra DB through CQL, you will provide different parameters when creating the vector store object. #### Initialization (Cassandra cluster) In this case, you first need to create a `cassandra.cluster.Session` object, as described in the [Cassandra driver documentation]( The details vary (e.g. with network settings and authentication), but this might be something like: ```python from cassandra.cluster import Cluster cluster = Cluster([""127.0.0.1""]) session = cluster.connect() ``` You can now set the session, along with your desired keyspace name, as a global CassIO parameter: ```python import cassio CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE = input(""CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE = "") cassio.init(session=session, keyspace=CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE) ``` Now you can create the vector store: ```python vstore = Cassandra( embedding=embe, table_name=""cassandra_vector_demo"", # session=None, keyspace=None # Uncomment on older versions of LangChain ) ``` #### Initialization (Astra DB through CQL) In this case you initialize CassIO with the following connection parameters: - the Database ID, e.g. `01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef` - the Token, e.g. `AstraCS:6gBhNmsk135....` (it must be a ""Database Administrator"" token) - Optionally a Keyspace name (if omitted, the default one for the database will be used) ```python ASTRA_DB_ID = input(""ASTRA_DB_ID = "") ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN = getpass(""ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN = "") desired_keyspace = input(""ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE (optional, can be left empty) = "") if desired_keyspace: ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE = desired_keyspace else: ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE = None ``` ```python import cassio cassio.init( database_id=ASTRA_DB_ID, token=ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN, keyspace=ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE, ) ``` Now you can create the vector store: ```python vstore = Cassandra( embedding=embe, table_name=""cassandra_vector_demo"", # session=None, keyspace=None # Uncomment on older versions of LangChain ) ``` ### Usage of the vector store _See the sections ""Load a dataset"" through ""A minimal RAG chain"" above._ Speaking of the latter, you can check out a full RAG template for Astra DB through CQL [here]( ### Cleanup the following essentially retrieves the `Session` object from CassIO and runs a CQL `DROP TABLE` statement with it: ```python cassio.config.resolve_session().execute( f""DROP TABLE {cassio.config.resolve_keyspace()}.cassandra_vector_demo;"" ) ``` ### Learn more For more information, extended quickstarts and additional usage examples, please visit the [CassIO documentation]( for more on using the LangChain `Cassandra` vector store. - [Setup and general dependencies](#setup-and-general-dependencies) - [Astra DB](#astra-db-1)- [Astra DB connection parameters](#astra-db-connection-parameters) - [Load a dataset](#load-a-dataset) - [Run simple searches](#run-simple-searches) - [MMR (Maximal-marginal-relevance) search](#mmr-maximal-marginal-relevance-search) - [Deleting stored documents](#deleting-stored-documents) - [A minimal RAG chain](#a-minimal-rag-chain) - [Cleanup](#cleanup) - [Apache Cassandra and Astra DB through CQL](#apache-cassandra-and-astra-db-through-cql)- [Initialization](#initialization) - [Usage of the vector store](#usage-of-the-vector-store) - [Cleanup](#cleanup-1) - [Learn more](#learn-more)', 'Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) | Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) []( ## Overview ### What is RAG? RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer: ``` We\'ll use the [LCEL Runnable]( protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box ```python from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python for chunk in rag_chain.stream(""What is Task Decomposition?""): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Task decomposition can be performed by AI models with prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ### Go deeper #### Choosing LLMs `ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model wrapper.

There are two main things we need to do to support this. 1. Add a messages placeholder to our chain which allows us to pass in historical messages 2. Add a chain that takes the latest user query and reformulates it in the context of the chat history into a standalone question that can be passed to our retriever. Let\'s start with 2. We can build a ""condense question"" chain that looks something like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder condense_q_system_prompt = """"""Given a chat history and the latest user question \\ which might reference the chat history, formulate a standalone question \\ which can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \\ just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."""""" condense_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", condense_q_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) condense_q_chain = condense_q_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""What is meant by large"", } ) ``` ```text \'What is the definition of ""large"" in the context of a language model?\' ``` ```python condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""How do transformers work"", } ) ``` ```text \'How do transformer models function?\' ``` And now we can build our full QA chain. Notice we add some routing functionality to only run the ""condense question chain"" when our chat history isn\'t empty. ```python qa_system_prompt = """"""You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \\ Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. \\ If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. \\ Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\ {context}"""""" qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", qa_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) def condense_question(input: dict): if input.get(""chat_history""): return condense_q_chain else: return input[""question""] rag_chain = ( RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=condense_question | retriever | format_docs) | qa_prompt | llm ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] question = ""What is Task Decomposition?"" ai_msg = rag_chain.invoke({""question"": question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=question), ai_msg]) second_question = ""What are common ways of doing it?"" rag_chain.invoke({""question"": second_question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'Common ways of task decomposition include:\\n\\n1.

Prompting with LLM: Language Model (LLM) can be used to prompt the model with simple instructions like ""Steps for XYZ"" or ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"" This allows the model to generate a sequence of subtasks or thought steps.\\n\\n3. Task-specific instructions: For certain tasks, task-specific instructions can be provided to guide the model in decomposing the task. For example, for writing a novel, the instruction ""Write a story outline"" can be given to break down the task into manageable steps.\\n\\n4.

It uses [PGVector]( extension as shown in the [RAG empowered SQL cookbook](/docs/templates/cookbook/retrieval_in_sql.ipynb) ## Environment Setup If you are using `ChatOpenAI` as your LLM, make sure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your environment. You can change both the LLM and embeddings model inside `chain.py` And you can configure configure the following environment variables for use by the template (defaults are in parentheses) - `POSTGRES_USER` (postgres) - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (test) - `POSTGRES_DB` (vectordb) - `POSTGRES_HOST` (localhost) - `POSTGRES_PORT` (5432) If you don\'t have a postgres instance, you can run one locally in docker: ```bash docker run \\ --name some-postgres \\ -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test \\ -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \\ -e POSTGRES_DB=vectordb \\ -p 5432:5432 \\ postgres:16 ``` And to start again later, use the `--name` defined above: ```bash docker start some-postgres ``` ### PostgreSQL Database setup Apart from having `pgvector` extension enabled, you will need to do some setup before being able to run semantic search within your SQL queries. In order to run RAG over your postgreSQL database you will need to generate the embeddings for the specific columns you want. This process is covered in the [RAG empowered SQL cookbook](/docs/templates/cookbook/retrieval_in_sql.ipynb), but the overall approach consist of: 1. Querying for unique values in the column 2. Generating embeddings for those values 3. Store the embeddings in a separate column or in an auxiliary table. ## Usage To use this package, you should first have the LangChain CLI installed: ```shell pip install -U langchain-cli ``` To create a new LangChain project and install this as the only package, you can do: ```shell langchain app new my-app --package sql-pgvector ``` If you want to add this to an existing project, you can just run: ```shell langchain app add sql-pgvector ``` And add the following code to your `server.py` file: ```python from sql_pgvector import chain as sql_pgvector_chain add_routes(app, sql_pgvector_chain, path=""/sql-pgvector"") ``` (Optional) Let\'s now configure LangSmith. LangSmith will help us trace, monitor and debug LangChain applications.

It provides a simple API to build Grounded Generation (aka Retrieval-augmented-generation or RAG) applications. **Vectara Overview:** - `Vectara` is developer-first API platform for building GenAI applications - To use Vectara - first [sign up]( and create an account. Then create a corpus and an API key for indexing and searching. - You can use Vectara\'s [indexing API]( to add documents into Vectara\'s index - You can use Vectara\'s [Search API]( to query Vectara\'s index (which also supports Hybrid search implicitly). - You can use Vectara\'s integration with LangChain as a Vector store or using the Retriever abstraction. ## Installation and Setup To use `Vectara` with LangChain no special installation steps are required. To get started, [sign up]( and follow our [quickstart]( guide to create a corpus and an API key. Once you have these, you can provide them as arguments to the Vectara vectorstore, or you can set them as environment variables. - export `VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID`=""your_customer_id"" - export `VECTARA_CORPUS_ID`=""your_corpus_id"" - export `VECTARA_API_KEY`=""your-vectara-api-key"" ## Vector Store There exists a wrapper around the Vectara platform, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore, whether for semantic search or example selection. To import this vectorstore: ```python from langchain.vectorstores import Vectara ``` To create an instance of the Vectara vectorstore: ```python vectara = Vectara( vectara_customer_id=customer_id, vectara_corpus_id=corpus_id, vectara_api_key=api_key ) ``` The customer_id, corpus_id and api_key are optional, and if they are not supplied will be read from the environment variables `VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID`, `VECTARA_CORPUS_ID` and `VECTARA_API_KEY`, respectively. After you have the vectorstore, you can `add_texts` or `add_documents` as per the standard `VectorStore` interface, for example: ```python vectara.add_texts([""to be or not to be"", ""that is the question""]) ``` Since Vectara supports file-upload, we also added the ability to upload files (PDF, TXT, HTML, PPT, DOC, etc) directly as file. When using this method, the file is uploaded directly to the Vectara backend, processed and chunked optimally there, so you don\'t have to use the LangChain document loader or chunking mechanism. As an example: ```python vectara.add_files([""path/to/file1.pdf"", ""path/to/file2.pdf"",...]) ``` To query the vectorstore, you can use the `similarity_search` method (or `similarity_search_with_score`), which takes a query string and returns a list of results: ```python results = vectara.similarity_score(""what is LangChain?"") ``` `similarity_search_with_score` also supports the following additional arguments: - `k`: number of results to return (defaults to 5) - `lambda_val`: the [lexical matching]( factor for hybrid search (defaults to 0.025) - `filter`: a [filter]( to apply to the results (default None) - `n_sentence_context`: number of sentences to include before/after the actual matching segment when returning results. This defaults to 2. The results are returned as a list of relevant documents, and a relevance score of each document. For a more detailed examples of using the Vectara wrapper, see one of these two sample notebooks: - [Chat Over Documents with Vectara](/docs/integrations/providers/vectara/vectara_chat.html) - [Vectara Text Generation](/docs/integrations/providers/vectara/vectara_text_generation.html) - [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) - [Vector Store](#vector-store)', 'Cohere RAG retriever | Cohere RAG retriever This notebook covers how to get started with Cohere RAG retriever.

44,How do i run lcel in java,"['Prompt templates | Prompt templates Prompt templates are pre-defined recipes for generating prompts for language models. A template may include instructions, few-shot examples, and specific context and questions appropriate for a given task. LangChain provides tooling to create and work with prompt templates. LangChain strives to create model agnostic templates to make it easy to reuse existing templates across different language models. Typically, language models expect the prompt to either be a string or else a list of chat messages. ## PromptTemplate Use `PromptTemplate` to create a template for a string prompt. By default, `PromptTemplate` uses [Python\'s str.format]( syntax for templating. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."" ) prompt_template.format(adjective=""funny"", content=""chickens"") ``` ```text \'Tell me a funny joke about chickens.\' ``` The template supports any number of variables, including no variables: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke"") prompt_template.format() ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke\' ``` For additional validation, specify `input_variables` explicitly. These variables will be compared against the variables present in the template string during instantiation, **raising an exception if there is a mismatch**. For example: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate invalid_prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""adjective""], template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."", ) ``` ```text --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ValidationError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[19], line 3 1 from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ----> 3 invalid_prompt = PromptTemplate( 4 input_variables=[""adjective""], 5 template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."" 6 ) File ~/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/load/serializable.py:97, in Serializable.__init__(self, **kwargs) 96 def __init__(self, **kwargs: Any) -> None: ---> 97 super().__init__(**kwargs) 98 self._lc_kwargs = kwargs File ~/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pydantic/main.py:341, in pydantic.main.BaseModel.__init__() ValidationError: 1 validation error for PromptTemplate __root__ Invalid prompt schema; check for mismatched or missing input parameters. \'content\' (type=value_error) ``` You can create custom prompt templates that format the prompt in any way you want. For more information, see [Custom Prompt Templates](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/custom_prompt_template.html). ## ChatPromptTemplate The prompt to [chat models](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/models/chat) is a list of chat messages. Each chat message is associated with content, and an additional parameter called `role`. For example, in the OpenAI [Chat Completions API]( a chat message can be associated with an AI assistant, a human or a system role. Create a chat prompt template like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a helpful AI bot. Your name is {name}.""), (""human"", ""Hello, how are you doing?""), (""ai"", ""I\'m doing well, thanks!""), (""human"", ""{user_input}""), ] ) messages = chat_template.format_messages(name=""Bob"", user_input=""What is your name?"") ``` `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages` accepts a variety of message representations. For example, in addition to using the 2-tuple representation of (type, content) used above, you could pass in an instance of `MessagePromptTemplate` or `BaseMessage`. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import HumanMessagePromptTemplate from langchain.schema.messages import SystemMessage chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=( ""You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to "" ""sound more upbeat."" ) ), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{text}""), ] ) llm = ChatOpenAI() llm(chat_template.format_messages(text=""i dont like eating tasty things."")) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'I absolutely love indulging in delicious treats!\') ``` This provides you with a lot of flexibility in how you construct your chat prompts. ## LCEL `PromptTemplate` and `ChatPromptTemplate` implement the [Runnable interface](/docs/expression_language/interface), the basic building block of the [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/expression_language/). This means they support `invoke`, `ainvoke`, `stream`, `astream`, `batch`, `abatch`, `astream_log` calls. `PromptTemplate` accepts a dictionary (of the prompt variables) and returns a `StringPromptValue`. A `ChatPromptTemplate` accepts a dictionary and returns a `ChatPromptValue`. ```python prompt_val = prompt_template.invoke({""adjective"": ""funny"", ""content"": ""chickens""}) prompt_val ``` ```text StringPromptValue(text=\'Tell me a joke\') ``` ```python prompt_val.to_string() ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke\' ``` ```python prompt_val.to_messages() ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=\'Tell me a joke\')] ``` ```python chat_val = chat_template.invoke({""text"": ""i dont like eating tasty things.""}) ``` ```python chat_val.to_messages() ``` ```text [SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to sound more upbeat.""), HumanMessage(content=\'i dont like eating tasty things.\')] ``` ```python chat_val.to_string() ``` ```text ""System: You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to sound more upbeat.\\nHuman: i dont like eating tasty things."" ``` - [PromptTemplate](#prompttemplate) - [ChatPromptTemplate](#chatprompttemplate) - [LCEL](#lcel)', 'Prompt pipelining | Prompt pipelining The idea behind prompt pipelining is to provide a user friendly interface for composing different parts of prompts together. You can do this with either string prompts or chat prompts. Constructing prompts this way allows for easy reuse of components. ## String prompt pipelining When working with string prompts, each template is joined together. You can work with either prompts directly or strings (the first element in the list needs to be a prompt). ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` ```python prompt = ( PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") + "", make it funny"" + ""\\n\\nand in {language}"" ) ``` ```python prompt ``` ```text PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'language\', \'topic\'], output_parser=None, partial_variables={}, template=\'Tell me a joke about {topic}, make it funny\\n\\nand in {language}\', template_format=\'f-string\', validate_template=True) ``` ```python prompt.format(topic=""sports"", language=""spanish"") ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke about sports, make it funny\\n\\nand in spanish\' ``` You can also use it in an LLMChain, just like before. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=prompt) ``` ```python chain.run(topic=""sports"", language=""spanish"") ``` ```text \'Por qu el futbolista llevaba un paraguas al partido?\\n\\nPorque pronosticaban lluvia de goles.\' ``` ## Chat prompt pipelining A chat prompt is made up a of a list of messages. Purely for developer experience, we\'ve added a convinient way to create these prompts. In this pipeline, each new element is a new message in the final prompt. ```python from langchain.schema import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage ``` First, let\'s initialize the base ChatPromptTemplate with a system message. It doesn\'t have to start with a system, but it\'s often good practice ```python prompt = SystemMessage(content=""You are a nice pirate"") ``` You can then easily create a pipeline combining it with other messages _or_ message templates. Use a `Message` when there is no variables to be formatted, use a `MessageTemplate` when there are variables to be formatted. You can also use just a string (note: this will automatically get inferred as a HumanMessagePromptTemplate.) ```python new_prompt = ( prompt + HumanMessage(content=""hi"") + AIMessage(content=""what?"") + ""{input}"" ) ``` Under the hood, this creates an instance of the ChatPromptTemplate class, so you can use it just as you did before! ```python new_prompt.format_messages(input=""i said hi"") ``` ```text [SystemMessage(content=\'You are a nice pirate\', additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessage(content=\'hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'what?\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=\'i said hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)] ``` You can also use it in an LLMChain, just like before. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=new_prompt) ``` ```python chain.run(""i said hi"") ``` ```text \'Oh, hello! How can I assist you today?\' ``` - [String prompt pipelining](#string-prompt-pipelining) - [Chat prompt pipelining](#chat-prompt-pipelining)', 'Chains | Chains Using an LLM in isolation is fine for simple applications, but more complex applications require chaining LLMs - either with each other or with other components. LangChain provides two high-level frameworks for ""chaining"" components. The legacy approach is to use the `Chain` interface. The updated approach is to use the [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/expression_language/). When building new applications we recommend using LCEL for chain composition. But there are a number of useful, built-in `Chain`\'s that we continue to support, so we document both frameworks here. As we\'ll touch on below, `Chain`\'s can also themselves be used in LCEL, so the two are not mutually exclusive. ## LCEL The most visible part of LCEL is that it provides an intuitive and readable syntax for composition. But more importantly, it also provides first-class support for: - [streaming](/docs/expression_language/interface#stream), - [async calls](/docs/expression_language/interface#async-stream), - [batching](/docs/expression_language/interface#batch), - [parallelization](/docs/expression_language/interface#parallelism), - retries, - [fallbacks](/docs/expression_language/how_to/fallbacks), - tracing, - [and more.](/docs/expression_language/why) As a simple and common example, we can see what it\'s like to combine a prompt, model and output parser: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser model = ChatAnthropic() prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a very knowledgeable historian who provides accurate and eloquent answers to historical questions."", ), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) runnable = prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python for chunk in runnable.stream({""question"": ""How did Mansa Musa accumulate his wealth?""}): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Mansa Musa was the emperor of the Mali Empire in West Africa during the 14th century. He accumulated immense wealth through several means: - Gold mining - Mali contained very rich gold deposits, especially in the region of Bambuk. Gold mining and gold trade was a major source of wealth for the empire. - Control of trade routes - Mali dominated the trans-Saharan trade routes connecting West Africa to North Africa and beyond. By taxing the goods that passed through its territory, Mali profited greatly. - Tributary states - Many lands surrounding Mali paid tribute to the empire. This came in the form of gold, slaves, and other valuable resources. - Agriculture - Mali also had extensive agricultural lands irrigated by the Niger River. Surplus food produced could be sold or traded. - Royal monopolies - The emperor claimed monopoly rights over the production and sale of certain goods like salt from the Taghaza mines. This added to his personal wealth. - Inheritance - As an emperor, Mansa Musa inherited a wealthy state. His predecessors had already consolidated lands and accumulated riches which fell to Musa. So in summary, mining, trade, taxes, ``` For more head to the [LCEL section](/docs/expression_language/). ## [Legacy] Chain interface **Chain**\'s are the legacy interface for ""chained"" applications. We define a Chain very generically as a sequence of calls to components, which can include other chains. The base interface is simple: ```python class Chain(BaseModel, ABC): """"""Base interface that all chains should implement."""""" memory: BaseMemory callbacks: Callbacks def __call__( self, inputs: Any, return_only_outputs: bool = False, callbacks: Callbacks = None, ) -> Dict[str, Any]: ... ``` We can recreate the LCEL runnable we made above using the built-in `LLMChain`: ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=prompt, output_parser=StrOutputParser()) chain.run(question=""How did Mansa Musa accumulate his wealth?"") ``` ```text "" Mansa Musa was the emperor of the Mali Empire in West Africa in the early 14th century.

By taxing and controlling this lucrative trade, Mansa Musa reaped great riches.\\n\\n- Tributes from conquered lands - The Mali Empire expanded significantly under Mansa Musa\'s rule. As new lands were conquered, they paid tribute to the mansa in the form of gold, salt, and slaves.\\n\\n- Inheritance - Mansa Musa inherited a wealthy empire from his predecessor. He continued to build the wealth of Mali through the factors above.\\n\\n- Sound fiscal management - Musa is considered to have managed the empire and its finances very effectively, including keeping taxes reasonable and promoting a robust economy.

Lakehouse Platform unifies data, analytics, and AI on one platform. This example notebook shows how to wrap Databricks endpoints as LLMs in LangChain. It supports two endpoint types: - Serving endpoint, recommended for production and development, - Cluster driver proxy app, recommended for iteractive development. ```python from langchain.llms import Databricks ``` ## Wrapping a serving endpoint Prerequisites: - An LLM was registered and deployed to [a Databricks serving endpoint]( - You have [""Can Query"" permission]( to the endpoint. The expected MLflow model signature is: - inputs: `[{""name"": ""prompt"", ""type"": ""string""}, {""name"": ""stop"", ""type"": ""list[string]""}]` - outputs: `[{""type"": ""string""}]` If the model signature is incompatible or you want to insert extra configs, you can set `transform_input_fn` and `transform_output_fn` accordingly. ```python # If running a Databricks notebook attached to an interactive cluster in ""single user"" # or ""no isolation shared"" mode, you only need to specify the endpoint name to create # a `Databricks` instance to query a serving endpoint in the same workspace. llm = Databricks(endpoint_name=""dolly"") llm(""How are you?"") ``` ```text \'I am happy to hear that you are in good health and as always, you are appreciated.\' ``` ```python llm(""How are you?"", stop=["".""]) ``` ```text \'Good\' ``` ```python # Otherwise, you can manually specify the Databricks workspace hostname and personal access token # or set `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` environment variables, respectively. # See # We strongly recommend not exposing the API token explicitly inside a notebook. # You can use Databricks secret manager to store your API token securely. # See import os os.environ[""DATABRICKS_TOKEN""] = dbutils.secrets.get(""myworkspace"", ""api_token"") llm = Databricks(host=""myworkspace.cloud.databricks.com"", endpoint_name=""dolly"") llm(""How are you?"") ``` ```text \'I am fine. Thank you!\' ``` ```python # If the serving endpoint accepts extra parameters like `temperature`, # you can set them in `model_kwargs`. llm = Databricks(endpoint_name=""dolly"", model_kwargs={""temperature"": 0.1}) llm(""How are you?"") ``` ```text \'I am fine.\' ``` ```python # Use `transform_input_fn` and `transform_output_fn` if the serving endpoint # expects a different input schema and does not return a JSON string, # respectively, or you want to apply a prompt template on top. def transform_input(**request): full_prompt = f""""""{request[""prompt""]} Be Concise. """""" request[""prompt""] = full_prompt return request llm = Databricks(endpoint_name=""dolly"", transform_input_fn=transform_input) llm(""How are you?"") ``` ```text \'I\'m Excellent. You?\' ``` ## Wrapping a cluster driver proxy app Prerequisites: - An LLM loaded on a Databricks interactive cluster in ""single user"" or ""no isolation shared"" mode. - A local HTTP server running on the driver node to serve the model at `""/""` using HTTP POST with JSON input/output. - It uses a port number between `[3000, 8000]` and listens to the driver IP address or simply `0.0.0.0` instead of localhost only. - You have ""Can Attach To"" permission to the cluster. The expected server schema (using JSON schema) is: - inputs:```json {""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""prompt"": {""type"": ""string""}, ""stop"": {""type"": ""array"", ""items"": {""type"": ""string""}}}, ""required"": [""prompt""]} ``` - outputs: `{""type"": ""string""}` If the server schema is incompatible or you want to insert extra configs, you can use `transform_input_fn` and `transform_output_fn` accordingly. The following is a minimal example for running a driver proxy app to serve an LLM: ```python from flask import Flask, request, jsonify import torch from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer, StoppingCriteria model = ""databricks/dolly-v2-3b"" tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model, padding_side=""left"") dolly = pipeline(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, trust_remote_code=True, device_map=""auto"") device = dolly.device class CheckStop(StoppingCriteria): def __init__(self, stop=None): super().__init__() self.stop = stop or [] self.matched = """" self.stop_ids = [tokenizer.encode(s, return_tensors=\'pt\').to(device) for s in self.stop] def __call__(self, input_ids: torch.LongTensor, scores: torch.FloatTensor, **kwargs): for i, s in enumerate(self.stop_ids): if torch.all((s == input_ids[0][-s.shape[1]:])).item(): self.matched = self.stop[i] return True return False def llm(prompt, stop=None, **kwargs): check_stop = CheckStop(stop) result = dolly(prompt, stopping_criteria=[check_stop], **kwargs) return result[0][""generated_text""].rstrip(check_stop.matched) app = Flask(""dolly"") @app.route(\'/\', methods=[\'POST\']) def serve_llm(): resp = llm(**request.json) return jsonify(resp) app.run(host=""0.0.0.0"", port=""7777"") ``` Once the server is running, you can create a `Databricks` instance to wrap it as an LLM. ```python # If running a Databricks notebook attached to the same cluster that runs the app, # you only need to specify the driver port to create a `Databricks` instance. llm = Databricks(cluster_driver_port=""7777"") llm(""How are you?"") ``` ```text \'Hello, thank you for asking.

You?\' ``` ```python # If the app accepts extra parameters like `temperature`, # you can set them in `model_kwargs`. llm = Databricks(cluster_driver_port=""7777"", model_kwargs={""temperature"": 0.1}) llm(""How are you?"") ``` ```text \'I am very well. It is a pleasure to meet you.\' ``` ```python # Use `transform_input_fn` and `transform_output_fn` if the app # expects a different input schema and does not return a JSON string, # respectively, or you want to apply a prompt template on top. def transform_input(**request): full_prompt = f""""""{request[""prompt""]} Be Concise.

However, delivering LLM applications to production can be deceptively difficult. You will likely have to heavily customize and iterate on your prompts, chains, and other components to create a high-quality product. To aid in this process, we\'ve launched LangSmith, a unified platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring your LLM applications. When might this come in handy? You may find it useful when you want to: - Quickly debug a new chain, agent, or set of tools - Visualize how components (chains, llms, retrievers, etc.) relate and are used - Evaluate different prompts and LLMs for a single component - Run a given chain several times over a dataset to ensure it consistently meets a quality bar - Capture usage traces and using LLMs or analytics pipelines to generate insights ## Prerequisites **Create a LangSmith account and create an API key (see bottom left corner). Familiarize yourself with the platform by looking through the docs** Note LangSmith is in closed beta; we\'re in the process of rolling it out to more users. However, you can fill out the form on the website for expedited access. Now, let\'s get started! ## Log runs to LangSmith First, configure your environment variables to tell LangChain to log traces. This is done by setting the `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2` environment variable to true. You can tell LangChain which project to log to by setting the `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT` environment variable (if this isn\'t set, runs will be logged to the `default` project). This will automatically create the project for you if it doesn\'t exist. You must also set the `LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT` and `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` environment variables. For more information on other ways to set up tracing, please reference the [LangSmith documentation]( **NOTE:** You must also set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables in order to run the following tutorial. **NOTE:** You can only access an API key when you first create it. Keep it somewhere safe. **NOTE:** You can also use a context manager in python to log traces using ```python from langchain.callbacks.manager import tracing_v2_enabled with tracing_v2_enabled(project_name=""My Project""): agent.run(""How many people live in canada as of 2023?"") ``` However, in this example, we will use environment variables. ```python %pip install openai tiktoken pandas duckduckgo-search --quiet ``` ```python import os from uuid import uuid4 unique_id = uuid4().hex[0:8] os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_PROJECT""] = f""Tracing Walkthrough - {unique_id}"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT""] = "" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = """" # Update to your API key # Used by the agent in this tutorial os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """" ``` Create the langsmith client to interact with the API ```python from langsmith import Client client = Client() ``` Create a LangChain component and log runs to the platform. In this example, we will create a ReAct-style agent with access to a general search tool (DuckDuckGo). The agent\'s prompt can be viewed in the [Hub here]( ```python from langchain import hub from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.agents.output_parsers import OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchResults from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function # Fetches the latest version of this prompt prompt = hub.pull(""wfh/langsmith-agent-prompt:latest"") llm = ChatOpenAI( model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"", temperature=0, ) tools = [ DuckDuckGoSearchResults( name=""duck_duck_go"" ), # General internet search using DuckDuckGo ] llm_with_tools = llm.bind(functions=[format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools]) runnable_agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) agent_executor = AgentExecutor( agent=runnable_agent, tools=tools, handle_parsing_errors=True ) ``` We are running the agent concurrently on multiple inputs to reduce latency. Runs get logged to LangSmith in the background so execution latency is unaffected. ```python inputs = [ ""What is LangChain?"", ""What\'s LangSmith?"", ""When was Llama-v2 released?"", ""What is the langsmith cookbook?"", ""When did langchain first announce the hub?"", ] results = agent_executor.batch([{""input"": x} for x in inputs], return_exceptions=True) ``` ```python results[:2] ``` ```text [{\'input\': \'What is LangChain?\', \'output\': \'I\\\'m sorry, but I couldn\\\'t find any information about ""LangChain"". Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?\'}, {\'input\': ""What\'s LangSmith?"", \'output\': \'I\\\'m sorry, but I couldn\\\'t find any information about ""LangSmith"". It could be a specific term or a company that is not widely known. Can you provide more context or clarify what you are referring to?\'}] ``` Assuming you\'ve successfully set up your environment, your agent traces should show up in the `Projects` section in the [app]( Congrats! ![Initial Runs](/assets/images/log_traces-edd14f0c4d5c320263362395793babdc.png) It looks like the agent isn\'t effectively using the tools though. Let\'s evaluate this so we have a baseline. ## Evaluate Agent In addition to logging runs, LangSmith also allows you to test and evaluate your LLM applications. In this section, you will leverage LangSmith to create a benchmark dataset and run AI-assisted evaluators on an agent. You will do so in a few steps: 1. Create a dataset 2. Initialize a new agent to benchmark 3. Configure evaluators to grade an agent\'s output 4. Run the agent over the dataset and evaluate the results ### 1. Create a LangSmith dataset Below, we use the LangSmith client to create a dataset from the input questions from above and a list labels. You will use these later to measure performance for a new agent. A dataset is a collection of examples, which are nothing more than input-output pairs you can use as test cases to your application. For more information on datasets, including how to create them from CSVs or other files or how to create them in the platform, please refer to the [LangSmith documentation]( ```python outputs = [ ""LangChain is an open-source framework for building applications using large language models. It is also the name of the company building LangSmith."", ""LangSmith is a unified platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring language model applications and agents powered by LangChain"", ""July 18, 2023"", ""The langsmith cookbook is a github repository containing detailed examples of how to use LangSmith to debug, evaluate, and monitor large language model-powered applications."", ""September 5, 2023"", ] ``` ```python dataset_name = f""agent-qa-{unique_id}"" dataset = client.create_dataset( dataset_name, description=""An example dataset of questions over the LangSmith documentation."", ) for query, answer in zip(inputs, outputs): client.create_example( inputs={""input"": query}, outputs={""output"": answer}, dataset_id=dataset.id ) ``` ### 2. Initialize a new agent to benchmark LangSmith lets you evaluate any LLM, chain, agent, or even a custom function. Conversational agents are stateful (they have memory); to ensure that this state isn\'t shared between dataset runs, we will pass in a `chain_factory` (aka a `constructor`) function to initialize for each call. In this case, we will test an agent that uses OpenAI\'s function calling endpoints. ```python from langchain import hub from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.agents.output_parsers import OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function # Since chains can be stateful (e.g. they can have memory), we provide # a way to initialize a new chain for each row in the dataset. This is done # by passing in a factory function that returns a new chain for each row. def agent_factory(prompt): llm_with_tools = llm.bind( functions=[format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools] ) runnable_agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) return AgentExecutor(agent=runnable_agent, tools=tools, handle_parsing_errors=True) ``` ### 3. Configure evaluation Manually comparing the results of chains in the UI is effective, but it can be time consuming. It can be helpful to use automated metrics and AI-assisted feedback to evaluate your component\'s performance. Below, we will create some pre-implemented run evaluators that do the following: - Compare results against ground truth labels. - Measure semantic (dis)similarity using embedding distance - Evaluate \'aspects\' of the agent\'s response in a reference-free manner using custom criteria For a longer discussion of how to select an appropriate evaluator for your use case and how to create your own custom evaluators, please refer to the [LangSmith documentation]( ```python from langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorType from langchain.smith import RunEvalConfig evaluation_config = RunEvalConfig( # Evaluators can either be an evaluator type (e.g., ""qa"", ""criteria"", ""embedding_distance"", etc.) or a configuration for that evaluator evaluators=[ # Measures whether a QA response is ""Correct"", based on a reference answer # You can also select via the raw string ""qa"" EvaluatorType.QA, # Measure the embedding distance between the output and the reference answer # Equivalent to: EvalConfig.EmbeddingDistance(embeddings=OpenAIEmbeddings()) EvaluatorType.EMBEDDING_DISTANCE, # Grade whether the output satisfies the stated criteria. # You can select a default one such as ""helpfulness"" or provide your own. RunEvalConfig.LabeledCriteria(""helpfulness""), # The LabeledScoreString evaluator outputs a score on a scale from 1-10. # You can use default criteria or write our own rubric RunEvalConfig.LabeledScoreString( { ""accuracy"": """""" Score 1: The answer is completely unrelated to the reference. Score 3: The answer has minor relevance but does not align with the reference. Score 5: The answer has moderate relevance but contains inaccuracies. Score 7: The answer aligns with the reference but has minor errors or omissions. Score 10: The answer is completely accurate and aligns perfectly with the reference."""""" }, normalize_by=10, ), ], # You can add custom StringEvaluator or RunEvaluator objects here as well, which will automatically be # applied to each prediction. Check out the docs for examples. custom_evaluators=[], ) ``` ### 4. Run the agent and evaluators Use the [run_on_dataset]( (or asynchronous [arun_on_dataset]( function to evaluate your model. This will: 1. Fetch example rows from the specified dataset. 2. Run your agent (or any custom function) on each example. 3. Apply evaluators to the resulting run traces and corresponding reference examples to generate automated feedback. The results will be visible in the LangSmith app. ```python from langchain import hub # We will test this version of the prompt prompt = hub.pull(""wfh/langsmith-agent-prompt:798e7324"") ``` ```python import functools from langchain.smith import ( arun_on_dataset, run_on_dataset, ) chain_results = run_on_dataset( dataset_name=dataset_name, llm_or_chain_factory=functools.partial(agent_factory, prompt=prompt), evaluation=evaluation_config, verbose=True, client=client, project_name=f""runnable-agent-test-5d466cbc-{unique_id}"", tags=[ ""testing-notebook"", ""prompt:5d466cbc"", ], # Optional, adds a tag to the resulting chain runs ) # Sometimes, the agent will error due to parsing issues, incompatible tool inputs, etc. # These are logged as warnings here and captured as errors in the tracing UI. ``` ```text View the evaluation results for project \'runnable-agent-test-5d466cbc-bf2162aa\' at: [> ] 0/5 Chain failed for example 54b4fce8-4492-409d-94af-708f51698b39 with inputs {\'input\': \'Who trained Llama-v2?\'} Error Type: TypeError, Message: DuckDuckGoSearchResults._run() got an unexpected keyword argument \'arg1\' [------------------------------------------------->] 5/5 Eval quantiles: 0.25 0.5 0.75 mean mode embedding_cosine_distance 0.086614 0.118841 0.183672 0.151444 0.050158 correctness 0.000000 0.500000 1.000000 0.500000 0.000000 score_string:accuracy 0.775000 1.000000 1.000000 0.775000 1.000000 helpfulness 0.750000 1.000000 1.000000 0.750000 1.000000 ``` ### Review the test results You can review the test results tracing UI below by clicking the URL in the output above or navigating to the ""Testing & Datasets"" page in LangSmith **""agent-qa-{unique_id}""** dataset. ![test results](/assets/images/test_results-15649f0f4500fd64ef2209229951a6c1.png) This will show the new runs and the feedback logged from the selected evaluators.

Let\'s fetch the run traces from the evaluation run. **Note: It may be a few moments before all the runs are accessible.** ```python runs = client.list_runs(project_name=chain_results[""project_name""], execution_order=1) ``` ```python # After some time, these will be populated. client.read_project(project_name=chain_results[""project_name""]).feedback_stats ``` ## Conclusion Congratulations!

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved. I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now. It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue it\'s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables. My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\'ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use! I didn\'t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+.

46,How can I create a simple chat model using my locally saved huggingface model,"['Memory in LLMChain | Memory in LLMChain This notebook goes over how to use the Memory class with an `LLMChain`. We will add the [ConversationBufferMemory]( class, although this can be any memory class. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` The most important step is setting up the prompt correctly. In the below prompt, we have two input keys: one for the actual input, another for the input from the Memory class. Importantly, we make sure the keys in the `PromptTemplate` and the `ConversationBufferMemory` match up (`chat_history`). ```python template = """"""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. {chat_history} Human: {human_input} Chatbot:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""chat_history"", ""human_input""], template=template ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend Chatbot: > Finished chain. \' Hi there! How can I help you today?\' ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Not too bad - how are you?"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

Chatbot: > Finished chain. "" I\'m doing great, thanks for asking! How are you doing?"" ``` ## Adding Memory to a chat model-based LLMChain The above works for completion-style `LLM`s, but if you are using a chat model, you will likely get better performance using structured chat messages. Below is an example. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, ) from langchain.schema import SystemMessage ``` We will use the [ChatPromptTemplate]( class to set up the chat prompt. The [from_messages]( method creates a `ChatPromptTemplate` from a list of messages (e.g., `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ChatMessage`, etc.) or message templates, such as the [MessagesPlaceholder]( below. The configuration below makes it so the memory will be injected to the middle of the chat prompt, in the `chat_history` key, and the user\'s inputs will be added in a human/user message to the end of the chat prompt. ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The persistent system prompt MessagesPlaceholder( variable_name=""chat_history"" ), # Where the memory will be stored. HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""{human_input}"" ), # Where the human input will injected ] ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI() chat_llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

Then, specify the path that you downloaded to to. E.g., for me, the model lives here: `/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/gpt4all/models/nous-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin` ```python from langchain.llms import GPT4All llm = GPT4All( model=""/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/gpt4all/models/nous-hermes-13b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin"", max_tokens=2048, ) ``` ## LLMChain Run an `LLMChain` (see [here]( with either model by passing in the retrieved docs and a simple prompt. It formats the prompt template using the input key values provided and passes the formatted string to `GPT4All`, `LLama-V2`, or another specified LLM. In this case, the list of retrieved documents (`docs`) above are pass into `{context}`. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate # Prompt prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""Summarize the main themes in these retrieved docs: {docs}"" ) # Chain llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) # Run question = ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(question) result = llm_chain(docs) # Output result[""text""] ``` ```text Llama.generate: prefix-match hit Based on the retrieved documents, the main themes are: 1. Task decomposition: The ability to break down complex tasks into smaller subtasks, which can be handled by an LLM or other components of the agent system. 2. LLM as the core controller: The use of a large language model (LLM) as the primary controller of an autonomous agent system, complemented by other key components such as a knowledge graph and a planner. 3. Potentiality of LLM: The idea that LLMs have the potential to be used as powerful general problem solvers, not just for generating well-written copies but also for solving complex tasks and achieving human-like intelligence. 4.

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You will need `transformers` and `torch`.

   ```bash
   pip install transformers torch
   ```

2. **Load the Model and Tokenizer**:
   Use the `from_pretrained` method to load your locally saved model and tokenizer.

   ```python
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

   model_path = ""path/to/your/local/model""
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path)
   ```

3. **Define a Function for Chatting**:
   Create a function to generate responses based on user input.

   ```python
   def chat(input_text):
       inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=""pt"")
       outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=100)
       response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
       return response
   ```

4. **Run the Chat**:
   Use the `chat` function to interact with your model.

   ```python
   user_input = ""Hello, how are you?""
   print(chat(user_input))
   ```

This setup will allow you to create a simple chat model using your locally saved Hugging Face model. Adjust the `max_length` parameter as needed for longer or shorter responses.","Certainly! To create a simple chat model using your locally saved Hugging Face model, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary Python libraries:

- Install 'transformers' library for working with models and tokenizers using 'pip install transformers'.

2. Import the `HuggingFacePipeline` class to work with your local pipeline

```
from langchain.llms import HuggingFacePipeline

# Create an instance of the wrapper
llm = HuggingFacePipeline.from_model_id(""path/to/model_directory"", task=""text-generation"")

Alternatively, load your pipeline directly:
```

pipe = pipeline(
    ""text-generation"", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, max_new_tokens=10
)

The tool is a wrapper for the [PyGitHub]( library. ## Quickstart 1. Install the pygithub library 2. Create a Github app 3. Set your environmental variables 4. Pass the tools to your agent with `toolkit.get_tools()` Each of these steps will be explained in great detail below. 1. **Get Issues**- fetches issues from the repository. 2. **Get Issue**- fetches details about a specific issue. 3. **Comment on Issue**- posts a comment on a specific issue. 4. **Create Pull Request**- creates a pull request from the bot\'s working branch to the base branch. 5. **Create File**- creates a new file in the repository. 6. **Read File**- reads a file from the repository. 7. **Update File**- updates a file in the repository. 8. **Delete File**- deletes a file from the repository. ## Setup ### 1. Install the pygithub library ```python %pip install pygithub ``` ### 2. Create a Github App [Follow the instructions here]( to create and register a Github app. Make sure your app has the following [repository permissions:]( - Commit statuses (read only) - Contents (read and write) - Issues (read and write) - Metadata (read only) - Pull requests (read and write) Once the app has been registered, add it to the repository you wish the bot to act upon. ### 3. Set Environmental Variables Before initializing your agent, the following environmental variables need to be set: - **GITHUB_APP_ID**- A six digit number found in your app\'s general settings - **GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY**- The location of your app\'s private key .pem file - **GITHUB_REPOSITORY**- The name of the Github repository you want your bot to act upon. Must follow the format {username}/{repo-name}. Make sure the app has been added to this repository first! - **GITHUB_BRANCH**- The branch where the bot will make its commits. Defaults to \'master.\' - **GITHUB_BASE_BRANCH**- The base branch of your repo, usually either \'main\' or \'master.\' This is where pull requests will base from. Defaults to \'master.\' ## Example: Simple Agent ```python import os from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.github.toolkit import GitHubToolkit from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities.github import GitHubAPIWrapper ``` ```python # Set your environment variables using os.environ os.environ[""GITHUB_APP_ID""] = ""123456"" os.environ[""GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY""] = ""path/to/your/private-key.pem"" os.environ[""GITHUB_REPOSITORY""] = ""username/repo-name"" os.environ[""GITHUB_BRANCH""] = ""bot-branch-name"" os.environ[""GITHUB_BASE_BRANCH""] = ""main"" # This example also requires an OpenAI API key os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """" ``` ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) github = GitHubAPIWrapper() toolkit = GitHubToolkit.from_github_api_wrapper(github) agent = initialize_agent( toolkit.get_tools(), llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""You have the software engineering capabilities of a Google Principle engineer.

[Anthropic]( is an AI safety and research company, and is the creator of Claude. This page covers all integrations between Anthropic models and LangChain. ## Prompting Overview Claude is chat-based model, meaning it is trained on conversation data. However, it is a text based API, meaning it takes in single string. It expects this string to be in a particular format. This means that it is up the user to ensure that is the case. LangChain provides several utilities and helper functions to make sure prompts that you write - whether formatted as a string or as a list of messages - end up formatted correctly. Specifically, Claude is trained to fill in text for the Assistant role as part of an ongoing dialogue between a human user (`Human:`) and an AI assistant (`Assistant:`). Prompts sent via the API must contain `\\n\\nHuman:` and `\\n\\nAssistant:` as the signals of who\'s speaking. The final turn must always be `\\n\\nAssistant:` - the input string cannot have `\\n\\nHuman:` as the final role. Because Claude is chat-based but accepts a string as input, it can be treated as either a LangChain `ChatModel` or `LLM`. This means there are two wrappers in LangChain - `ChatAnthropic` and `Anthropic`. It is generally recommended to use the `ChatAnthropic` wrapper, and format your prompts as `ChatMessage`s (we will show examples of this below). This is because it keeps your prompt in a general format that you can easily then also use with other models (should you want to). However, if you want more fine-grained control over the prompt, you can use the `Anthropic` wrapper - we will show and example of this as well. The `Anthropic` wrapper however is deprecated, as all functionality can be achieved in a more generic way using `ChatAnthropic`. ## Prompting Best Practices Anthropic models have several prompting best practices compared to OpenAI models. **No System Messages** Anthropic models are not trained on the concept of a ""system message"". We have worked with the Anthropic team to handle them somewhat appropriately (a Human message with an `admin` tag) but this is largely a hack and it is recommended that you do not use system messages. **AI Messages Can Continue** A completion from Claude is a continuation of the last text in the string which allows you further control over Claude\'s output. For example, putting words in Claude\'s mouth in a prompt like this: `\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: What do you call a bear with no teeth?` This will return a completion like this `A gummy bear!` instead of a whole new assistant message with a different random bear joke. ## ChatAnthropic `ChatAnthropic` is a subclass of LangChain\'s `ChatModel`, meaning it works best with `ChatPromptTemplate`. You can import this wrapper with the following code: ```text from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic model = ChatAnthropic() ``` When working with ChatModels, it is preferred that you design your prompts as `ChatPromptTemplate`s. Here is an example below of doing that: ```text from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", ""You are a helpful chatbot""), (""human"", ""Tell me a joke about {topic}""), ]) ``` You can then use this in a chain as follows: ```text chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` How is the prompt actually being formatted under the hood? We can see that by running the following code ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nYou are a helpful chatbot\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that under the hood LangChain is not appending any prefix/suffix to `SystemMessage`\'s. This is because Anthropic has no concept of `SystemMessage`. Anthropic requires all prompts to end with assistant messages. This means if the last message is not an assistant message, the suffix `Assistant:` will automatically be inserted. If you decide instead to use a normal PromptTemplate (one that just works on a single string) let\'s take a look at what happens: ```text from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that it automatically adds the Human and Assistant tags. What is happening under the hood? First: the string gets converted to a single human message. This happens generically (because we are using a subclass of `ChatModel`). Then, similarly to the above example, an empty Assistant message is getting appended. This is Anthropic specific. ## [Deprecated] Anthropic This `Anthropic` wrapper is subclassed from `LLM`. We can import it with: ```text from langchain.llms import Anthropic model = Anthropic() ``` This model class is designed to work with normal PromptTemplates. An example of that is below: ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` Let\'s see what is going on with the prompt templating under the hood! ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs the following ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:\\n\' ``` Notice that it adds the Human tag at the start of the string, and then finishes it with `\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:`. The extra `Sure, here you go` was added on purpose by the Anthropic team. What happens if we have those symbols in the prompt directly? ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Human: Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\' ``` We can see that we detect that the user is trying to use the special tokens, and so we don\'t do any formatting. - [Prompting Overview](#prompting-overview) - [Prompting Best Practices](#prompting-best-practices) - [ChatAnthropic](#chatanthropic) - [Deprecated Anthropic](#deprecated-anthropic)', 'Dynamically route logic based on input | Dynamically route logic based on input This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language. Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`. Do not respond with more than one word. {question} Classification:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I call Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text \' Anthropic\' ``` Now, let\'s create three sub chains: ```python langchain_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in langchain. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Harrison Chase told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) anthropic_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in anthropic. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Dario Amodei told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) general_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch branch = RunnableBranch( (lambda x: ""anthropic"" in x[""topic""].lower(), anthropic_chain), (lambda x: ""langchain"" in x[""topic""].lower(), langchain_chain), general_chain, ) ``` ```python full_chain = {""topic"": chain, ""question"": lambda x: x[""question""]} | branch ``` ```python full_chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I use Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content="" As Dario Amodei told me, here are some ways to use Anthropic:\\n\\n- Sign up for an account on Anthropic\'s website to access tools like Claude, Constitutional AI, and Writer. \\n\\n- Use Claude for tasks like email generation, customer service chat, and QA.

To start, we will set up the retriever we want to use, and then turn it into a retriever tool. Next, we will use the high level constructor for this type of agent. Finally, we will walk through how to construct a conversational retrieval agent from components. ## The Retriever To start, we need a retriever to use! The code here is mostly just example code. Feel free to use your own retriever and skip to the section on creating a retriever tool. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader loader = TextLoader(""../../../../../docs/docs/modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() db = FAISS.from_documents(texts, embeddings) ``` ```python retriever = db.as_retriever() ``` ## Retriever Tool Now we need to create a tool for our retriever. The main things we need to pass in are a name for the retriever as well as a description. These will both be used by the language model, so they should be informative. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool ``` ```python tool = create_retriever_tool( retriever, ""search_state_of_union"", ""Searches and returns documents regarding the state-of-the-union."", ) tools = [tool] ``` ## Agent Constructor Here, we will use the high level `create_conversational_retrieval_agent` API to construct the agent. Notice that beside the list of tools, the only thing we need to pass in is a language model to use. Under the hood, this agent is using the OpenAIFunctionsAgent, so we need to use an ChatOpenAI model. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_conversational_retrieval_agent ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python agent_executor = create_conversational_retrieval_agent(llm, tools, verbose=True) ``` We can now try it out! ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""hi, im bob""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Hello Bob! How can I assist you today? > Finished chain. ``` ```python result[""output""] ``` ```text \'Hello Bob!

Let\'s take a look so we can understand how to modify going forward. There are a few components: - The memory - The prompt template - The agent - The agent executor ```python # This is needed for both the memory and the prompt memory_key = ""history"" ``` ### The Memory In this example, we want the agent to remember not only previous conversations, but also previous intermediate steps. For that, we can use `AgentTokenBufferMemory`. Note that if you want to change whether the agent remembers intermediate steps, or how the long the buffer is, or anything like that you should change this part. ```python from langchain.agents.openai_functions_agent.agent_token_buffer_memory import ( AgentTokenBufferMemory, ) memory = AgentTokenBufferMemory(memory_key=memory_key, llm=llm) ``` ## The Prompt Template For the prompt template, we will use the `OpenAIFunctionsAgent` default way of creating one, but pass in a system prompt and a placeholder for memory. ```python from langchain.agents.openai_functions_agent.base import OpenAIFunctionsAgent from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder from langchain.schema.messages import SystemMessage ``` ```python system_message = SystemMessage( content=( ""Do your best to answer the questions. "" ""Feel free to use any tools available to look up "" ""relevant information, only if necessary"" ) ) ``` ```python prompt = OpenAIFunctionsAgent.create_prompt( system_message=system_message, extra_prompt_messages=[MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=memory_key)], ) ``` ## The Agent We will use the OpenAIFunctionsAgent ```python agent = OpenAIFunctionsAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt) ``` ## The Agent Executor Importantly, we pass in `return_intermediate_steps=True` since we are recording that with our memory object ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor( agent=agent, tools=tools, memory=memory, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True, ) ``` ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""hi, im bob""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

An LLM agent consists of three parts: - `PromptTemplate`: This is the prompt template that can be used to instruct the language model on what to do - LLM: This is the language model that powers the agent - `stop` sequence: Instructs the LLM to stop generating as soon as this string is found - `OutputParser`: This determines how to parse the LLM output into an `AgentAction` or `AgentFinish` object The LLM Agent is used in an `AgentExecutor`. This `AgentExecutor` can largely be thought of as a loop that: 1. Passes user input and any previous steps to the Agent (in this case, the LLM Agent) 2. If the Agent returns an `AgentFinish`, then return that directly to the user 3. If the Agent returns an `AgentAction`, then use that to call a tool and get an `Observation` 4. Repeat, passing the `AgentAction` and `Observation` back to the Agent until an `AgentFinish` is emitted. `AgentAction` is a response that consists of `action` and `action_input`. `action` refers to which tool to use, and `action_input` refers to the input to that tool. `log` can also be provided as more context (that can be used for logging, tracing, etc). `AgentFinish` is a response that contains the final message to be sent back to the user. This should be used to end an agent run. In this notebook we walk through how to create a custom LLM agent. ## Set up environment Do necessary imports, etc. ```python from langchain.agents import Tool, AgentExecutor, LLMSingleActionAgent, AgentOutputParser from langchain.prompts import StringPromptTemplate from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper from langchain.chains import LLMChain from typing import List, Union from langchain.schema import AgentAction, AgentFinish, OutputParserException import re ``` ## Set up tool Set up any tools the agent may want to use. This may be necessary to put in the prompt (so that the agent knows to use these tools). ```python # Define which tools the agent can use to answer user queries search = SerpAPIWrapper() tools = [ Tool( name=""Search"", func=search.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" ) ] ``` ## Prompt template This instructs the agent on what to do. Generally, the template should incorporate: - `tools`: which tools the agent has access and how and when to call them. - `intermediate_steps`: These are tuples of previous (`AgentAction`, `Observation`) pairs. These are generally not passed directly to the model, but the prompt template formats them in a specific way. - `input`: generic user input ```python # Set up the base template template = """"""Answer the following questions as best you can, but speaking as a pirate might speak. You have access to the following tools: {tools} Use the following format: Question: the input question you must answer Thought: you should always think about what to do Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}] Action Input: the input to the action Observation: the result of the action ...

This usually depends heavily on the prompt used. This is where you can change the parsing to do retries, handle whitespace, etc. ```python class CustomOutputParser(AgentOutputParser): def parse(self, llm_output: str) -> Union[AgentAction, AgentFinish]: # Check if agent should finish if ""Final Answer:"" in llm_output: return AgentFinish( # Return values is generally always a dictionary with a single `output` key # It is not recommended to try anything else at the moment :) return_values={""output"": llm_output.split(""Final Answer:"")[-1].strip()}, log=llm_output, ) # Parse out the action and action input regex = r""Action\\s*\\d*\\s*:(.*?)\\nAction\\s*\\d*\\s*Input\\s*\\d*\\s*:[\\s]*(.*)"" match = re.search(regex, llm_output, re.DOTALL) if not match: raise OutputParserException(f""Could not parse LLM output: `{llm_output}`"") action = match.group(1).strip() action_input = match.group(2) # Return the action and action input return AgentAction(tool=action, tool_input=action_input.strip("" "").strip(\'""\'), log=llm_output) ``` ```python output_parser = CustomOutputParser() ``` ## Set up LLM Choose the LLM you want to use! ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ## Define the stop sequence This is important because it tells the LLM when to stop generation. This depends heavily on the prompt and model you are using. Generally, you want this to be whatever token you use in the prompt to denote the start of an `Observation` (otherwise, the LLM may hallucinate an observation for you). ## Set up the Agent We can now combine everything to set up our agent: ```python # LLM chain consisting of the LLM and a prompt llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) ``` ```python tool_names = [tool.name for tool in tools] agent = LLMSingleActionAgent( llm_chain=llm_chain, output_parser=output_parser, stop=[""\\nObservation:""], allowed_tools=tool_names ) ``` ## Use the Agent Now we can use it! ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` ```python agent_executor.run(""How many people live in canada as of 2023?"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

2. **Set Up Anthropic Model**:
   ```python
   from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic

   model = ChatAnthropic(model=""claude-instant-1.2"")
   ```

3. **Create React Agent**:
   ```python
   from langchain.agents import create_react_agent

   react_agent = create_react_agent(model)
   ```

4. **Integrate with React**:
   Use React components to interact with `react_agent`.

5. **Run the Agent**:
   ```python
   response = react_agent.run(""Your query here"")
   print(response)
   ```

Ensure you handle the model's input and output format correctly.","In order to use a ReAct Agent with an Anthropic model, you should first install the reuqired packages:

pip install anthropic

Next, import the necessary classes and functions:

    from langchain.agents import load_tools
    from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
    from langchain.agents import AgentType
    from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic

Next, create an instance of ChatAnthropic. Make sure you have set your API key in an environment variable called ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or pass anthropic_api_key as a parameter.

    chat = ChatAnthropic()

Next, load some tools for your agent to use:

    # Specify tools (these can be any custom tool, the following are examples)
tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=chat)

Finally, let's initialize an agent with the tools, the language model, and the type of agent we want to use.

    agent = initialize_agent(tools, chat, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

48,How do I use Qdrant as a vector store in the conversational retrieval chain?,"['Chatbots | Chatbots []( ## Use case Chatbots are one of the central LLM use-cases. The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1.

Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process.

They\'ve been kind enough to share their embeddings of the [LangChain docs]( and [API reference]( Let\'s take a look at how we can use these embeddings to power a docs retrieval system and ultimately a simple code generating chain! ```bash pip install langchain fleet-context openai pandas faiss-cpu # faiss-gpu for CUDA supported GPU ``` ```python from operator import itemgetter from typing import Any, Optional, Type import pandas as pd from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.retrievers import MultiVectorRetriever from langchain.schema import Document from langchain.schema.storage import BaseStore from langchain.schema.vectorstore import VectorStore from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS def load_fleet_retriever( df: pd.DataFrame, *, vectorstore_cls: Type[VectorStore] = FAISS, docstore: Optional[BaseStore] = None, **kwargs: Any, ): vectorstore = _populate_vectorstore(df, vectorstore_cls) if docstore is None: return vectorstore.as_retriever(**kwargs) else: _populate_docstore(df, docstore) return MultiVectorRetriever( vectorstore=vectorstore, docstore=docstore, id_key=""parent"", **kwargs ) def _populate_vectorstore( df: pd.DataFrame, vectorstore_cls: Type[VectorStore], ) -> VectorStore: if not hasattr(vectorstore_cls, ""from_embeddings""): raise ValueError( f""Incompatible vector store class {vectorstore_cls}.""

This means the vectors correspond to sections of pages in the LangChain docs, not entire pages. By default, when we spin up a retriever from these embeddings, we\'ll be retrieving these embedded chunks. We will be using Fleet Context\'s `download_embeddings()` to grab Langchain\'s documentation embeddings.

It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points - vectors with an additional payload. `Qdrant` is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications. This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `Qdrant` vector database. There are various modes of how to run `Qdrant`, and depending on the chosen one, there will be some subtle differences. The options include: - Local mode, no server required - On-premise server deployment - Qdrant Cloud See the [installation instructions]( ```bash pip install qdrant-client ``` We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` ```text OpenAI API Key: ``` ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant ``` ```python loader = TextLoader(""../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ## Connecting to Qdrant from LangChain ### Local mode Python client allows you to run the same code in local mode without running the Qdrant server. That\'s great for testing things out and debugging or if you plan to store just a small amount of vectors. The embeddings might be fully kepy in memory or persisted on disk. #### In-memory For some testing scenarios and quick experiments, you may prefer to keep all the data in memory only, so it gets lost when the client is destroyed - usually at the end of your script/notebook. ```python qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, location="":memory:"", # Local mode with in-memory storage only collection_name=""my_documents"", ) ``` #### On-disk storage Local mode, without using the Qdrant server, may also store your vectors on disk so they\'re persisted between runs. ```python qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, path=""/tmp/local_qdrant"", collection_name=""my_documents"", ) ``` ### On-premise server deployment No matter if you choose to launch Qdrant locally with [a Docker container]( or select a Kubernetes deployment with [the official Helm chart]( the way you\'re going to connect to such an instance will be identical. You\'ll need to provide a URL pointing to the service. ```python url = """" qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, url=url, prefer_grpc=True, collection_name=""my_documents"", ) ``` ### Qdrant Cloud If you prefer not to keep yourself busy with managing the infrastructure, you can choose to set up a fully-managed Qdrant cluster on [Qdrant Cloud]( There is a free forever 1GB cluster included for trying out. The main difference with using a managed version of Qdrant is that you\'ll need to provide an API key to secure your deployment from being accessed publicly. ```python url = """" api_key = """" qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, url=url, prefer_grpc=True, api_key=api_key, collection_name=""my_documents"", ) ``` ## Recreating the collection Both `Qdrant.from_texts` and `Qdrant.from_documents` methods are great to start using Qdrant with Langchain. In the previous versions the collection was recreated every time you called any of them. That behaviour has changed. Currently, the collection is going to be reused if it already exists. Setting `force_recreate` to `True` allows to remove the old collection and start from scratch. ```python url = """" qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, url=url, prefer_grpc=True, collection_name=""my_documents"", force_recreate=True, ) ``` ## Similarity search The simplest scenario for using Qdrant vector store is to perform a similarity search. Under the hood, our query will be encoded with the `embedding_function` and used to find similar documents in Qdrant collection. ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search(query) ``` ```python print(found_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you\'re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\'s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\'s legacy of excellence. ``` ## Similarity search with score Sometimes we might want to perform the search, but also obtain a relevancy score to know how good is a particular result. The returned distance score is cosine distance. Therefore, a lower score is better. ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search_with_score(query) ``` ```python document, score = found_docs[0] print(document.page_content) print(f""\\nScore: {score}"") ``` ```text Tonight.

Score: 0.8153784913324512 ``` ### Metadata filtering Qdrant has an [extensive filtering system]( with rich type support. It is also possible to use the filters in Langchain, by passing an additional param to both the `similarity_search_with_score` and `similarity_search` methods. ```python from qdrant_client.http import models as rest query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search_with_score(query, filter=rest.Filter(...)) ``` ## Maximum marginal relevance search (MMR) If you\'d like to look up for some similar documents, but you\'d also like to receive diverse results, MMR is method you should consider. Maximal marginal relevance optimizes for similarity to query AND diversity among selected documents. ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" found_docs = qdrant.max_marginal_relevance_search(query, k=2, fetch_k=10) ``` ```python for i, doc in enumerate(found_docs): print(f""{i + 1}."", doc.page_content, ""\\n"") ``` ```text 1.

We can\'t change how divided we\'ve been. But we can change how we move forwardon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. Officer Mora was 27 years old. Officer Rivera was 22. Both Dominican Americans who\'d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.

In such cases you may need to define how to map Qdrant point into the Langchain `Document`. ### Named vectors Qdrant supports [multiple vectors per point]( by named vectors. Langchain requires just a single embedding per document and, by default, uses a single vector. However, if you work with a collection created externally or want to have the named vector used, you can configure it by providing its name. ```python Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, location="":memory:"", collection_name=""my_documents_2"", vector_name=""custom_vector"", ) ``` As a Langchain user, you won\'t see any difference whether you use named vectors or not. Qdrant integration will handle the conversion under the hood. ### Metadata Qdrant stores your vector embeddings along with the optional JSON-like payload. Payloads are optional, but since LangChain assumes the embeddings are generated from the documents, we keep the context data, so you can extract the original texts as well. By default, your document is going to be stored in the following payload structure: ```json { ""page_content"": ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"", ""metadata"": { ""foo"": ""bar"" } } ``` You can, however, decide to use different keys for the page content and metadata. That\'s useful if you already have a collection that you\'d like to reuse. ```python Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, location="":memory:"", collection_name=""my_documents_2"", content_payload_key=""my_page_content_key"", metadata_payload_key=""my_meta"", ) ``` ```text ``` - [Connecting to Qdrant from LangChain](#connecting-to-qdrant-from-langchain)- [Local mode](#local-mode) - [On-premise server deployment](#on-premise-server-deployment) - [Qdrant Cloud](#qdrant-cloud) - [Recreating the collection](#recreating-the-collection) - [Similarity search](#similarity-search) - [Similarity search with score](#similarity-search-with-score)- [Metadata filtering](#metadata-filtering) - [Maximum marginal relevance search (MMR)](#maximum-marginal-relevance-search-mmr) - [Qdrant as a Retriever](#qdrant-as-a-retriever) - [Customizing Qdrant](#customizing-qdrant)- [Named vectors](#named-vectors) - [Metadata](#metadata)', 'RAG with Agents | RAG with Agents This is an agent specifically optimized for doing retrieval when necessary and also holding a conversation. To start, we will set up the retriever we want to use, and then turn it into a retriever tool. Next, we will use the high level constructor for this type of agent. Finally, we will walk through how to construct a conversational retrieval agent from components. ## The Retriever To start, we need a retriever to use! The code here is mostly just example code. Feel free to use your own retriever and skip to the section on creating a retriever tool. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader loader = TextLoader(""../../../../../docs/docs/modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() db = FAISS.from_documents(texts, embeddings) ``` ```python retriever = db.as_retriever() ``` ## Retriever Tool Now we need to create a tool for our retriever. The main things we need to pass in are a name for the retriever as well as a description. These will both be used by the language model, so they should be informative. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool ``` ```python tool = create_retriever_tool( retriever, ""search_state_of_union"", ""Searches and returns documents regarding the state-of-the-union."", ) tools = [tool] ``` ## Agent Constructor Here, we will use the high level `create_conversational_retrieval_agent` API to construct the agent. Notice that beside the list of tools, the only thing we need to pass in is a language model to use. Under the hood, this agent is using the OpenAIFunctionsAgent, so we need to use an ChatOpenAI model. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_conversational_retrieval_agent ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python agent_executor = create_conversational_retrieval_agent(llm, tools, verbose=True) ``` We can now try it out! ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""hi, im bob""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Hello Bob! How can I assist you today? > Finished chain. ``` ```python result[""output""] ``` ```text \'Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?\' ``` Notice that it remembers your name ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""whats my name?""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Your name is Bob. > Finished chain. ``` ```python result[""output""] ``` ```text \'Your name is Bob.\' ``` Notice that it now does retrieval ```python result = agent_executor( { ""input"": ""what did the president say about kentaji brown jackson in the most recent state of the union?"" } ) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Let\'s take a look so we can understand how to modify going forward. There are a few components: - The memory - The prompt template - The agent - The agent executor ```python # This is needed for both the memory and the prompt memory_key = ""history"" ``` ### The Memory In this example, we want the agent to remember not only previous conversations, but also previous intermediate steps. For that, we can use `AgentTokenBufferMemory`. Note that if you want to change whether the agent remembers intermediate steps, or how the long the buffer is, or anything like that you should change this part. ```python from langchain.agents.openai_functions_agent.agent_token_buffer_memory import ( AgentTokenBufferMemory, ) memory = AgentTokenBufferMemory(memory_key=memory_key, llm=llm) ``` ## The Prompt Template For the prompt template, we will use the `OpenAIFunctionsAgent` default way of creating one, but pass in a system prompt and a placeholder for memory. ```python from langchain.agents.openai_functions_agent.base import OpenAIFunctionsAgent from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder from langchain.schema.messages import SystemMessage ``` ```python system_message = SystemMessage( content=( ""Do your best to answer the questions. "" ""Feel free to use any tools available to look up "" ""relevant information, only if necessary"" ) ) ``` ```python prompt = OpenAIFunctionsAgent.create_prompt( system_message=system_message, extra_prompt_messages=[MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=memory_key)], ) ``` ## The Agent We will use the OpenAIFunctionsAgent ```python agent = OpenAIFunctionsAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt) ``` ## The Agent Executor Importantly, we pass in `return_intermediate_steps=True` since we are recording that with our memory object ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor( agent=agent, tools=tools, memory=memory, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True, ) ``` ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""hi, im bob""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

    pip install qdrant-client

Next, import the necessary classes and functions:

    from langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant
    from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
    from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI
    from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
    from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
    from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

Load, split, and embed your documents:

    loader = TextLoader(""state_of_the_union.txt"")
    documents = loader.load()

    text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0, separator=""
"")
    documents = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

Next, connect to Qdrant. This is for storing locally on-disk, but you can also use an on-premise server deployment or store on the Qdrant cloud:

    qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents(
        documents,
        embeddings,
        path=""/tmp/local_qdrant"",
        collection_name=""my_documents"",
    )

Next, create a memory object, which is necessary to track the inputs/outputs and hold a conversation:

    memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True)

Now initialize the ConversationalRetrievalChain:

    qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), qdrant.as_retriever(), memory=memory)

Now, you can create queries to test it out:

    query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
    result = qa({""question"": query})

Output:

    The president said that he had nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the United States Supreme Court four days ago.

    query = ""Who are they succeeding?""
    result = qa({""question"": query})

Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1. Simple prompting: Agents can use Language Model based prompting to break down tasks into subgoals. For example, by providing prompts like ""Steps for XYZ"" or ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", the agent can generate a sequence of smaller steps that lead to the completion of the overall task.\\n\\n2. Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to ""Write a story outline."" This provides a high-level structure for the task and helps in breaking it down into smaller components.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Agents can also take inputs from humans to decompose tasks. This can be done through direct communication or by leveraging human expertise. Humans can provide guidance and insights to help the agent break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals.\\n\\nOverall, task decomposition allows agents to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals, enabling them to plan and execute complex tasks efficiently.\'} ``` ```python qa(""What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'The human asks how agents use task decomposition. The AI explains that agents can use task decomposition in several ways, including simple prompting, task-specific instructions, and human inputs. Task decomposition allows agents to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals, enabling them to plan and execute complex tasks efficiently.\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'There are several ways to implement memory to support task decomposition:\\n\\n1. Long-Term Memory Management: This involves storing and organizing information in a long-term memory system. The agent can retrieve past experiences, knowledge, and learned strategies to guide the task decomposition process.\\n\\n2. Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents. This allows for easy retrieval and reference during the execution of the task.\\n\\nThese memory resources help the agent in organizing and managing information, making informed decisions, and effectively decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals.\'} ``` Again, we can use the [LangSmith trace]( to explore the prompt structure. ### Going deeper - Agents, such as the [conversational retrieval agent](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents), can be used for retrieval when necessary while also holding a conversation. - [Use case](#use-case) - [Overview](#overview) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Memory](#memory) - [Conversation](#conversation) - [Chat Retrieval](#chat-retrieval)- [Going deeper](#going-deeper)', 'RAG with Agents | RAG with Agents This is an agent specifically optimized for doing retrieval when necessary and also holding a conversation. To start, we will set up the retriever we want to use, and then turn it into a retriever tool. Next, we will use the high level constructor for this type of agent. Finally, we will walk through how to construct a conversational retrieval agent from components. ## The Retriever To start, we need a retriever to use! The code here is mostly just example code. Feel free to use your own retriever and skip to the section on creating a retriever tool. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader loader = TextLoader(""../../../../../docs/docs/modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() db = FAISS.from_documents(texts, embeddings) ``` ```python retriever = db.as_retriever() ``` ## Retriever Tool Now we need to create a tool for our retriever. The main things we need to pass in are a name for the retriever as well as a description. These will both be used by the language model, so they should be informative. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool ``` ```python tool = create_retriever_tool( retriever, ""search_state_of_union"", ""Searches and returns documents regarding the state-of-the-union."", ) tools = [tool] ``` ## Agent Constructor Here, we will use the high level `create_conversational_retrieval_agent` API to construct the agent. Notice that beside the list of tools, the only thing we need to pass in is a language model to use. Under the hood, this agent is using the OpenAIFunctionsAgent, so we need to use an ChatOpenAI model. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_conversational_retrieval_agent ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python agent_executor = create_conversational_retrieval_agent(llm, tools, verbose=True) ``` We can now try it out! ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""hi, im bob""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Hello Bob! How can I assist you today? > Finished chain. ``` ```python result[""output""] ``` ```text \'Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?\' ``` Notice that it remembers your name ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""whats my name?""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Your name is Bob. > Finished chain. ``` ```python result[""output""] ``` ```text \'Your name is Bob.\' ``` Notice that it now does retrieval ```python result = agent_executor( { ""input"": ""what did the president say about kentaji brown jackson in the most recent state of the union?"" } ) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Let\'s take a look so we can understand how to modify going forward. There are a few components: - The memory - The prompt template - The agent - The agent executor ```python # This is needed for both the memory and the prompt memory_key = ""history"" ``` ### The Memory In this example, we want the agent to remember not only previous conversations, but also previous intermediate steps. For that, we can use `AgentTokenBufferMemory`. Note that if you want to change whether the agent remembers intermediate steps, or how the long the buffer is, or anything like that you should change this part. ```python from langchain.agents.openai_functions_agent.agent_token_buffer_memory import ( AgentTokenBufferMemory, ) memory = AgentTokenBufferMemory(memory_key=memory_key, llm=llm) ``` ## The Prompt Template For the prompt template, we will use the `OpenAIFunctionsAgent` default way of creating one, but pass in a system prompt and a placeholder for memory. ```python from langchain.agents.openai_functions_agent.base import OpenAIFunctionsAgent from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder from langchain.schema.messages import SystemMessage ``` ```python system_message = SystemMessage( content=( ""Do your best to answer the questions. "" ""Feel free to use any tools available to look up "" ""relevant information, only if necessary"" ) ) ``` ```python prompt = OpenAIFunctionsAgent.create_prompt( system_message=system_message, extra_prompt_messages=[MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=memory_key)], ) ``` ## The Agent We will use the OpenAIFunctionsAgent ```python agent = OpenAIFunctionsAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt) ``` ## The Agent Executor Importantly, we pass in `return_intermediate_steps=True` since we are recording that with our memory object ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor( agent=agent, tools=tools, memory=memory, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True, ) ``` ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""hi, im bob""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Hello Bob! How can I assist you today? > Finished chain. ``` ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""whats my name""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Your name is Bob. > Finished chain. ``` - [The Retriever](#the-retriever) - [Retriever Tool](#retriever-tool) - [Agent Constructor](#agent-constructor) - [Creating from components](#creating-from-components)- [The Memory](#the-memory) - [The Prompt Template](#the-prompt-template) - [The Agent](#the-agent) - [The Agent Executor](#the-agent-executor)', 'Shared memory across agents and tools | Shared memory across agents and tools This notebook goes over adding memory to **both** an Agent and its tools.

The agent has access to a conversation memory, search tool, and a summarization tool. The summarization tool also needs access to the conversation memory. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, Tool, ZeroShotAgent from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory, ReadOnlySharedMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper ``` ```python template = """"""This is a conversation between a human and a bot: {chat_history} Write a summary of the conversation for {input}: """""" prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[""input"", ""chat_history""], template=template) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") readonlymemory = ReadOnlySharedMemory(memory=memory) summary_chain = LLMChain( llm=OpenAI(), prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=readonlymemory, # use the read-only memory to prevent the tool from modifying the memory ) ``` ```python search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper() tools = [ Tool( name=""Search"", func=search.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", ), Tool( name=""Summary"", func=summary_chain.run, description=""useful for when you summarize a conversation.

We will add the [ConversationBufferMemory]( class, although this can be any memory class. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` The most important step is setting up the prompt correctly. In the below prompt, we have two input keys: one for the actual input, another for the input from the Memory class. Importantly, we make sure the keys in the `PromptTemplate` and the `ConversationBufferMemory` match up (`chat_history`). ```python template = """"""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. {chat_history} Human: {human_input} Chatbot:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""chat_history"", ""human_input""], template=template ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend Chatbot: > Finished chain. \' Hi there! How can I help you today?\' ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Not too bad - how are you?"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend AI: Hi there! How can I help you today? Human: Not too bad - how are you? Chatbot: > Finished chain. "" I\'m doing great, thanks for asking! How are you doing?"" ``` ## Adding Memory to a chat model-based LLMChain The above works for completion-style `LLM`s, but if you are using a chat model, you will likely get better performance using structured chat messages. Below is an example. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, ) from langchain.schema import SystemMessage ``` We will use the [ChatPromptTemplate]( class to set up the chat prompt. The [from_messages]( method creates a `ChatPromptTemplate` from a list of messages (e.g., `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ChatMessage`, etc.) or message templates, such as the [MessagesPlaceholder]( below. The configuration below makes it so the memory will be injected to the middle of the chat prompt, in the `chat_history` key, and the user\'s inputs will be added in a human/user message to the end of the chat prompt. ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The persistent system prompt MessagesPlaceholder( variable_name=""chat_history"" ), # Where the memory will be stored. HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""{human_input}"" ), # Where the human input will injected ] ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI() chat_llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: System: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend > Finished chain. \'Hello! How can I assist you today, my friend?\' ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Not too bad - how are you?"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: System: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend AI: Hello! How can I assist you today, my friend? Human: Not too bad - how are you? > Finished chain. ""I\'m an AI chatbot, so I don\'t have feelings, but I\'m here to help and chat with you! Is there something specific you would like to talk about or any questions I can assist you with?"" ``` - [Adding Memory to a chat model-based LLMChain](#adding-memory-to-a-chat-model-based-llmchain)']","To use `ConversationSummaryMemory` in a conversational retrieval chain, you'll want to follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Memory**: Create an instance of `ConversationSummaryMemory`. This memory type will summarize the conversation over time, which is useful for longer interactions.

    ```python
    from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI

    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
    memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm)
    ```

2. **Create the Retriever**: Set up your retriever to fetch relevant documents. This could be a FAISS retriever, a BM25 retriever, or any other type of retriever you prefer.

    ```python
    from langchain.embeddings import ...  # Import necessary embeddings
    from langchain.vectorstores import ...  # Import necessary vectorstore
    from langchain.retrievers import ...  # Import necessary retriever

    # Initialize your retriever
    retriever = ...  # Your retriever instance
    ```

3. **Build the Conversational Retrieval Chain**: Combine the retriever, memory, and language model to create the conversational retrieval chain.

    ```python
    from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

    qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
        llm=llm,
        retriever=retriever,
        memory=memory
    )
    ```

4. **Interact with the Chain**: Now you can interact with the chain by asking questions. The memory will keep track of the conversation and use the summary to provide relevant answers.

    ```python
    result = qa.run(""Your question here"")
    print(result)
    ```

This setup allows the conversational retrieval chain to maintain context over multiple interactions while summarizing the conversation to manage token limits and improve efficiency.","In order to use Summary Memory in the conversational retrieval chain, you should first import the necessary classes and functions:

        from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory
    from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
    from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma # You can choose any LangChain vectorstore
    from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
    from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI # You can choose any LangChain vectorstore
    from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
    from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader

Split and embed your documents, and add them to your selected vectorstore:

    loader = TextLoader(""state_of_the_union.txt"")
    documents = loader.load()

    text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0, separator=""
"")
    documents = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents, embeddings)

Next, create a ConversationSummaryMemory object:

    memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo""), memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True)

Now initialize the ConversationalRetrievalChain:

    qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"",temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever(), memory=memory)

Now, you can create queries to test it out:

    query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
    result = qa({""question"": query})

Output:

    The president said that he had nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the United States Supreme Court four days ago.

    query = ""Who are they succeeding?""
    result = qa.invoke({""question"": query})

Output:

    Justice Breyer.",0.99999999998,0.875,1.0,6.25929273885076e-09,0.2407407407407407

Below we show how to easily go from a `YouTube url` to `audio of the video` to `text` to `chat`! We wil use the `OpenAIWhisperParser`, which will use the OpenAI Whisper API to transcribe audio to text, and the `OpenAIWhisperParserLocal` for local support and running on private clouds or on premise. Note: You will need to have an `OPENAI_API_KEY` supplied. ```python from langchain.document_loaders.blob_loaders.youtube_audio import YoutubeAudioLoader from langchain.document_loaders.generic import GenericLoader from langchain.document_loaders.parsers import ( OpenAIWhisperParser, OpenAIWhisperParserLocal, ) ``` We will use `yt_dlp` to download audio for YouTube urls.

The main difference between the two is that the encoder is used to encode the input sequence into a fixed-length representation, while the decoder is used to decode the fixed-length representation into an output sequence. In machine translation, for example, the encoder reads in the source language sentence and generates a fixed-length representation, which is then used by the decoder to generate the target language sentence.\' ``` ```python query = ""For any token, what are x, k, v, and q?"" qa_chain.run(query) ``` ```text \'For any token, x is the input vector that contains the private information of that token, k and q are the key and query vectors respectively, which are produced by forwarding linear modules on x, and v is the vector that is calculated by propagating the same linear module on x again.

This class helps map exported Telegram conversations to LangChain chat messages. The process has three steps: 1. Export the chat .txt file by copying chats from the Discord app and pasting them in a file on your local computer 2. Create the `TelegramChatLoader` with the file path pointed to the json file or directory of JSON files 3. Call `loader.load()` (or `loader.lazy_load()`) to perform the conversion. Optionally use `merge_chat_runs` to combine message from the same sender in sequence, and/or `map_ai_messages` to convert messages from the specified sender to the ""AIMessage"" class. ## 1. Create message dump Currently (2023/08/23) this loader best supports json files in the format generated by exporting your chat history from the [Telegram Desktop App]( **Important:** There are \'lite\' versions of telegram such as ""Telegram for MacOS"" that lack the export functionality. Please make sure you use the correct app to export the file. To make the export: 1. Download and open telegram desktop 2. Select a conversation 3. Navigate to the conversation settings (currently the three dots in the top right corner) 4. Click ""Export Chat History"" 5. Unselect photos and other media. Select ""Machine-readable JSON"" format to export. An example is below: telegram_conversation.json```json { ""name"": ""Jiminy"", ""type"": ""personal_chat"", ""id"": 5965280513, ""messages"": [ { ""id"": 1, ""type"": ""message"", ""date"": ""2023-08-23T13:11:23"", ""date_unixtime"": ""1692821483"", ""from"": ""Jiminy Cricket"", ""from_id"": ""user123450513"", ""text"": ""You better trust your conscience"", ""text_entities"": [ { ""type"": ""plain"", ""text"": ""You better trust your conscience"" } ] }, { ""id"": 2, ""type"": ""message"", ""date"": ""2023-08-23T13:13:20"", ""date_unixtime"": ""1692821600"", ""from"": ""Batman & Robin"", ""from_id"": ""user6565661032"", ""text"": ""What did you just say?"", ""text_entities"": [ { ""type"": ""plain"", ""text"": ""What did you just say?"" } ] } ] } ``` ## 2. Create the Chat Loader All that\'s required is the file path. You can optionally specify the user name that maps to an ai message as well an configure whether to merge message runs. ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.telegram import TelegramChatLoader ``` ```python loader = TelegramChatLoader( path=""./telegram_conversation.json"", ) ``` ## 3. Load messages The `load()` (or `lazy_load`) methods return a list of ""ChatSessions"" that currently just contain a list of messages per loaded conversation. ```python from typing import List from langchain.chat_loaders.base import ChatSession from langchain.chat_loaders.utils import ( map_ai_messages, merge_chat_runs, ) raw_messages = loader.lazy_load() # Merge consecutive messages from the same sender into a single message merged_messages = merge_chat_runs(raw_messages) # Convert messages from ""Jiminy Cricket"" to AI messages messages: List[ChatSession] = list( map_ai_messages(merged_messages, sender=""Jiminy Cricket"") ) ``` ### Next Steps You can then use these messages how you see fit, such as fine-tuning a model, few-shot example selection, or directly make predictions for the next message ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() for chunk in llm.stream(messages[0][""messages""]): print(chunk.content, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text I said, ""You better trust your conscience."" ``` - [1.

51,How do I load Youtube transcripts and CSV documents?,"['YouTube transcripts | YouTube transcripts [YouTube]( is an online video sharing and social media platform created by Google. This notebook covers how to load documents from `YouTube transcripts`. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import YoutubeLoader ``` ```python # !pip install youtube-transcript-api ``` ```python loader = YoutubeLoader.from_youtube_url( "" add_video_info=True ) ``` ```python loader.load() ``` ### Add video info ```python # ! pip install pytube ``` ```python loader = YoutubeLoader.from_youtube_url( "" add_video_info=True ) loader.load() ``` ### Add language preferences Language param : It\'s a list of language codes in a descending priority, `en` by default. translation param : It\'s a translate preference when the youtube does\'nt have your select language, `en` by default. ```python loader = YoutubeLoader.from_youtube_url( "" add_video_info=True, language=[""en"", ""id""], translation=""en"", ) loader.load() ``` ## YouTube loader from Google Cloud ### Prerequisites 1. Create a Google Cloud project or use an existing project 2. Enable the [Youtube Api]( 3. [Authorize credentials for desktop app]( 4. `pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib youtube-transcript-api` ### Instructions for ingesting your Google Docs data By default, the `GoogleDriveLoader` expects the `credentials.json` file to be `~/.credentials/credentials.json`, but this is configurable using the `credentials_file` keyword argument. Same thing with `token.json`. Note that `token.json` will be created automatically the first time you use the loader. `GoogleApiYoutubeLoader` can load from a list of Google Docs document ids or a folder id. You can obtain your folder and document id from the URL: Note depending on your set up, the `service_account_path` needs to be set up. See [here]( for more details. ```python # Init the GoogleApiClient from pathlib import Path from langchain.document_loaders import GoogleApiClient, GoogleApiYoutubeLoader google_api_client = GoogleApiClient(credentials_path=Path(""your_path_creds.json"")) # Use a Channel youtube_loader_channel = GoogleApiYoutubeLoader( google_api_client=google_api_client, channel_name=""Reducible"", captions_language=""en"", ) # Use Youtube Ids youtube_loader_ids = GoogleApiYoutubeLoader( google_api_client=google_api_client, video_ids=[""TrdevFK_am4""], add_video_info=True ) # returns a list of Documents youtube_loader_channel.load() ``` - [Add video info](#add-video-info) - [Add language preferences](#add-language-preferences) - [YouTube loader from Google Cloud](#youtube-loader-from-google-cloud)- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) - [ Instructions for ingesting your Google Docs data](#-instructions-for-ingesting-your-google-docs-data)', ""YouTube videos | YouTube videos icon marks a new addition [last update 2023-09-21] ### Official LangChain YouTube channel ### Introduction to LangChain with Harrison Chase, creator of LangChain - [Building the Future with LLMs, LangChain, & Pinecone]( by [Pinecone]( - [LangChain and Weaviate with Harrison Chase and Bob van Luijt - Weaviate Podcast #36]( by [Weaviate Vector Database]( - [LangChain Demo + Q&A with Harrison Chase]( by [Full Stack Deep Learning]( - [LangChain Agents: Build Personal Assistants For Your Data (Q&A with Harrison Chase and Mayo Oshin)]( by [Chat with data]( ## Videos (sorted by views) - [Using ChatGPT with YOUR OWN Data.

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved. I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now. It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue it\'s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables. My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\'ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use! I didn\'t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+.

The overall steps are: 1. Download your messenger data to disk. 2. Create the Chat Loader and call `loader.load()` (or `loader.lazy_load()`) to perform the conversion. 3. Optionally use `merge_chat_runs` to combine message from the same sender in sequence, and/or `map_ai_messages` to convert messages from the specified sender to the ""AIMessage"" class. Once you\'ve done this, call `convert_messages_for_finetuning` to prepare your data for fine-tuning. Once this has been done, you can fine-tune your model. To do so you would complete the following steps: 1. Upload your messages to OpenAI and run a fine-tuning job. 2. Use the resulting model in your LangChain app! Let\'s begin. ## 1. Download Data To download your own messenger data, following instructions [here]( IMPORTANT - make sure to download them in JSON format (not HTML).

Prepare for fine-tuning Calling `load()` returns all the chat messages we could extract as human messages. When conversing with chat bots, conversations typically follow a more strict alternating dialogue pattern relative to real conversations. You can choose to merge message ""runs"" (consecutive messages from the same sender) and select a sender to represent the ""AI"". The fine-tuned LLM will learn to generate these AI messages. ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.utils import ( map_ai_messages, merge_chat_runs, ) ``` ```python merged_sessions = merge_chat_runs(chat_sessions) alternating_sessions = list(map_ai_messages(merged_sessions, ""Harry Potter"")) ``` ```python # Now all of Harry Potter\'s messages will take the AI message class # which maps to the \'assistant\' role in OpenAI\'s training format alternating_sessions[0][""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [AIMessage(content=""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""What is it, Potter?

I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False)] ``` #### Now we can convert to OpenAI format dictionaries ```python from langchain.adapters.openai import convert_messages_for_finetuning ``` ```python training_data = convert_messages_for_finetuning(alternating_sessions) print(f""Prepared {len(training_data)} dialogues for training"") ``` ```text Prepared 9 dialogues for training ``` ```python training_data[0][:3] ``` ```text [{\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately.""}, {\'role\': \'user\', \'content\': ""What is it, Potter?

I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister.""}] ``` OpenAI currently requires at least 10 training examples for a fine-tuning job, though they recommend between 50-100 for most tasks. Since we only have 9 chat sessions, we can subdivide them (optionally with some overlap) so that each training example is comprised of a portion of a whole conversation. Facebook chat sessions (1 per person) often span multiple days and conversations, so the long-range dependencies may not be that important to model anyhow. ```python # Our chat is alternating, we will make each datapoint a group of 8 messages, # with 2 messages overlapping chunk_size = 8 overlap = 2 training_examples = [ conversation_messages[i : i + chunk_size] for conversation_messages in training_data for i in range(0, len(conversation_messages) - chunk_size + 1, chunk_size - overlap) ] len(training_examples) ``` ```text 100 ``` ## 4. Fine-tune the model It\'s time to fine-tune the model. Make sure you have `openai` installed and have set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` appropriately ```python # %pip install -U openai --quiet ``` ```python import json import time from io import BytesIO import openai # We will write the jsonl file in memory my_file = BytesIO() for m in training_examples: my_file.write((json.dumps({""messages"": m}) + ""\\n"").encode(""utf-8"")) my_file.seek(0) training_file = openai.File.create(file=my_file, purpose=""fine-tune"") # OpenAI audits each training file for compliance reasons. # This make take a few minutes status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""processed"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status print(f""File {training_file.id} ready after {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds."") ``` ```text File file-zCyNBeg4snpbBL7VkvsuhCz8 ready afer 30.55 seconds. ``` With the file ready, it\'s time to kick off a training job. ```python job = openai.FineTuningJob.create( training_file=training_file.id, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) ``` Grab a cup of tea while your model is being prepared. This may take some time! ```python status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""succeeded"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) job = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id) status = job.status ``` ```text Status=[running]... 908.87s ``` ```python print(job.fine_tuned_model) ``` ```text ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::7rDwkaOq ``` ## 5.

By default, most of the agents return a single string. It can often be useful to have an agent return something with more structure. A good example of this is an agent tasked with doing question-answering over some sources. Let\'s say we want the agent to respond not only with the answer, but also a list of the sources used. We then want our output to roughly follow the schema below: ```python class Response(BaseModel): """"""Final response to the question being asked"""""" answer: str = Field(description = ""The final answer to respond to the user"") sources: List[int] = Field(description=""List of page chunks that contain answer to the question. Only include a page chunk if it contains relevant information"") ``` In this notebook we will go over an agent that has a retriever tool and responds in the correct format. ## Create the Retriever In this section we will do some setup work to create our retriever over some mock data containing the ""State of the Union"" address. Importantly, we will add a ""page_chunk"" tag to the metadata of each document. This is just some fake data intended to simulate a source field. In practice, this would more likely be the URL or path of a document. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python # Load in document to retrieve over loader = TextLoader(""../../state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() # Split document into chunks text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) # Here is where we add in the fake source information for i, doc in enumerate(texts): doc.metadata[""page_chunk""] = i # Create our retriever embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings, collection_name=""state-of-union"") retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() ``` ## Create the tools We will now create the tools we want to give to the agent. In this case, it is just one - a tool that wraps our retriever. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.conversational_retrieval.tool import ( create_retriever_tool, ) retriever_tool = create_retriever_tool( retriever, ""state-of-union-retriever"", ""Query a retriever to get information about state of the union address"", ) ``` ## Create response schema Here is where we will define the response schema. In this case, we want the final answer to have two fields: one for the `answer`, and then another that is a list of `sources` ```python from typing import List from langchain.utils.openai_functions import convert_pydantic_to_openai_function from pydantic import BaseModel, Field class Response(BaseModel): """"""Final response to the question being asked"""""" answer: str = Field(description=""The final answer to respond to the user"") sources: List[int] = Field( description=""List of page chunks that contain answer to the question. Only include a page chunk if it contains relevant information"" ) ``` ## Create the custom parsing logic We now create some custom parsing logic. How this works is that we will pass the `Response` schema to the OpenAI LLM via their `functions` parameter. This is similar to how we pass tools for the agent to use. When the `Response` function is called by OpenAI, we want to use that as a signal to return to the user. When any other function is called by OpenAI, we treat that as a tool invocation. Therefore, our parsing logic has the following blocks: - If no function is called, assume that we should use the response to respond to the user, and therefore return `AgentFinish` - If the `Response` function is called, respond to the user with the inputs to that function (our structured output), and therefore return `AgentFinish` - If any other function is called, treat that as a tool invocation, and therefore return `AgentActionMessageLog` Note that we are using `AgentActionMessageLog` rather than `AgentAction` because it lets us attach a log of messages that we can use in the future to pass back into the agent prompt. ```python import json from langchain.schema.agent import AgentActionMessageLog, AgentFinish ``` ```python def parse(output): # If no function was invoked, return to user if ""function_call"" not in output.additional_kwargs: return AgentFinish(return_values={""output"": output.content}, log=output.content) # Parse out the function call function_call = output.additional_kwargs[""function_call""] name = function_call[""name""] inputs = json.loads(function_call[""arguments""]) # If the Response function was invoked, return to the user with the function inputs if name == ""Response"": return AgentFinish(return_values=inputs, log=str(function_call)) # Otherwise, return an agent action else: return AgentActionMessageLog( tool=name, tool_input=inputs, log="""", message_log=[output] ) ``` ## Create the Agent We can now put this all together! The components of this agent are: - prompt: a simple prompt with placeholders for the user\'s question and then the `agent_scratchpad` (any intermediate steps) - tools: we can attach the tools and `Response` format to the LLM as functions - format scratchpad: in order to format the `agent_scratchpad` from intermediate steps, we will use the standard `format_to_openai_function_messages`. This takes intermediate steps and formats them as AIMessages and FunctionMessages. - output parser: we will use our custom parser above to parse the response of the LLM - AgentExecutor: we will use the standard AgentExecutor to run the loop of agent-tool-agent-tool... ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function ``` ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a helpful assistant""), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python llm_with_tools = llm.bind( functions=[ # The retriever tool format_tool_to_openai_function(retriever_tool), # Response schema convert_pydantic_to_openai_function(Response), ] ) ``` ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], # Format agent scratchpad from intermediate steps ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | parse ) ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor(tools=[retriever_tool], agent=agent, verbose=True) ``` ## Run the agent We can now run the agent! Notice how it responds with a dictionary with two keys: `answer` and `sources` ```python agent_executor.invoke( {""input"": ""what did the president say about kentaji brown jackson""}, return_only_outputs=True, ) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Show this page source"", 'Pairwise string comparison | Pairwise string comparison []( Often you will want to compare predictions of an LLM, Chain, or Agent for a given input. The `StringComparison` evaluators facilitate this so you can answer questions like: - Which LLM or prompt produces a preferred output for a given question? - Which examples should I include for few-shot example selection? - Which output is better to include for fine-tuning? The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `pairwise_string` evaluator. Check out the reference docs for the [PairwiseStringEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are relevant to the question asked, as they both provide a numerical answer to the question about the number of dogs in the park. However, Response A is incorrect according to the reference answer, which states that there are four dogs. Response B, on the other hand, is correct as it matches the reference answer. Neither response demonstrates depth of thought, as they both simply provide a numerical answer without any additional information or context. \\n\\nBased on these criteria, Response B is the better response.\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Methods The pairwise string evaluator can be called using [evaluate_string_pairs]( (or async [aevaluate_string_pairs]( methods, which accept: - prediction (str) The predicted response of the first model, chain, or prompt. - prediction_b (str) The predicted response of the second model, chain, or prompt. - input (str) The input question, prompt, or other text. - reference (str) (Only for the labeled_pairwise_string variant) The reference response. They return a dictionary with the following values: - value: \'A\' or \'B\', indicating whether `prediction` or `prediction_b` is preferred, respectively - score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the \'value\', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `prediction_b` is preferred. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Without References When references aren\'t available, you can still predict the preferred response. The results will reflect the evaluation model\'s preference, which is less reliable and may result in preferences that are factually incorrect. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Addition is a mathematical operation."", prediction_b=""Addition is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers to create a third number, the \'sum\'."", input=""What is addition?"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are correct and relevant to the question. However, Response B is more helpful and insightful as it provides a more detailed explanation of what addition is. Response A is correct but lacks depth as it does not explain what the operation of addition entails. \\n\\nFinal Decision: [[B]]\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Defining the Criteria By default, the LLM is instructed to select the \'preferred\' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms: - [Criteria]( enum or its string value - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions - [Constitutional principal]( - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain - Dictionary: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description. - A list of criteria or constitutional principles - to combine multiple criteria in one. Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style. ```python custom_criteria = { ""simplicity"": ""Is the language straightforward and unpretentious?"", ""clarity"": ""Are the sentences clear and easy to understand?"", ""precision"": ""Is the writing precise, with no unnecessary words or details?"", ""truthfulness"": ""Does the writing feel honest and sincere?"", ""subtext"": ""Does the writing suggest deeper meanings or themes?"", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"", criteria=custom_criteria) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Every cheerful household shares a similar rhythm of joy; but sorrow, in each household, plays a unique, haunting melody."", prediction_b=""Where one finds a symphony of joy, every domicile of happiness resounds in harmonious,"" "" identical notes; yet, every abode of despair conducts a dissonant orchestra, each"" "" playing an elegy of grief that is peculiar and profound to its own existence."", input=""Write some prose about families."", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Response A is simple, clear, and precise. It uses straightforward language to convey a deep and sincere message about families. The metaphor of joy and sorrow as music is effective and easy to understand.\\n\\nResponse B, on the other hand, is more complex and less clear. The language is more pretentious, with words like ""domicile,"" ""resounds,"" ""abode,"" ""dissonant,"" and ""elegy."" While it conveys a similar message to Response A, it does so in a more convoluted way. The precision is also lacking due to the use of unnecessary words and details.\\n\\nBoth responses suggest deeper meanings or themes about the shared joy and unique sorrow in families. However, Response A does so in a more effective and accessible way.\\n\\nTherefore, the better response is [[A]].\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` ## Customize the LLM By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain. You can customize this when loading. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"", llm=llm) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Here is my assessment:\\n\\nResponse B is more helpful, insightful, and accurate than Response A. Response B simply states ""4"", which directly answers the question by providing the exact number of dogs mentioned in the reference answer. In contrast, Response A states ""there are three dogs"", which is incorrect according to the reference answer. \\n\\nIn terms of helpfulness, Response B gives the precise number while Response A provides an inaccurate guess. For relevance, both refer to dogs in the park from the question. However, Response B is more correct and factual based on the reference answer. Response A shows some attempt at reasoning but is ultimately incorrect. Response B requires less depth of thought to simply state the factual number.\\n\\nIn summary, Response B is superior in terms of helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth. My final decision is: [[B]]\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Customize the Evaluation Prompt You can use your own custom evaluation prompt to add more task-specific instructions or to instruct the evaluator to score the output. *Note: If you use a prompt that expects generates a result in a unique format, you may also have to pass in a custom output parser (`output_parser=your_parser()`) instead of the default `PairwiseStringResultOutputParser` ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the input context, which do you prefer: A or B? Evaluate based on the following criteria: {criteria} Reason step by step and finally, respond with either [[A]] or [[B]] on its own line.

B is not relevant as it provides a different name.\\nCorrectness: A is correct as it accurately states the name of the dog. B is incorrect as it provides a different name.\\nDepth: Both A and B demonstrate a similar level of depth as they both provide a straightforward answer to the question.\\n\\nGiven these evaluations, the preferred response is:\\n\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` - [Methods](#methods) - [Without References](#without-references) - [Defining the Criteria](#defining-the-criteria) - [Customize the LLM](#customize-the-llm) - [Customize the Evaluation Prompt](#customize-the-evaluation-prompt)', 'Agent Trajectory | Agent Trajectory []( Agents can be difficult to holistically evaluate due to the breadth of actions and generation they can make. We recommend using multiple evaluation techniques appropriate to your use case. One way to evaluate an agent is to look at the whole trajectory of actions taken along with their responses. Evaluators that do this can implement the `AgentTrajectoryEvaluator` interface. This walkthrough will show how to use the `trajectory` evaluator to grade an OpenAI functions agent. For more information, check out the reference docs for the [TrajectoryEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""trajectory"") ``` ## Methods The Agent Trajectory Evaluators are used with the [evaluate_agent_trajectory]( (and async [aevaluate_agent_trajectory]( methods, which accept: - input (str) The input to the agent. - prediction (str) The final predicted response. - agent_trajectory (List[Tuple [AgentAction, str] ]) The intermediate steps forming the agent trajectory They return a dictionary with the following values: - score: Float from 0 to 1, where 1 would mean ""most effective"" and 0 would mean ""least effective"" - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Capturing Trajectory The easiest way to return an agent\'s trajectory (without using tracing callbacks like those in LangSmith) for evaluation is to initialize the agent with `return_intermediate_steps=True`. Below, create an example agent we will call to evaluate. ```python import subprocess from urllib.parse import urlparse from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import tool from pydantic import HttpUrl @tool def ping(url: HttpUrl, return_error: bool) -> str: """"""Ping the fully specified url.

You can select any chat model for the agent trajectory evaluator as below. ```python # %pip install anthropic # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic eval_llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""trajectory"", llm=eval_llm) ``` ```python evaluation_result = evaluator.evaluate_agent_trajectory( prediction=result[""output""], input=result[""input""], agent_trajectory=result[""intermediate_steps""], ) evaluation_result ``` ```text {\'score\': 1.0, \'reasoning\': ""Here is my detailed evaluation of the AI\'s response:\\n\\ni.

It allows you to verify if an LLM or Chain\'s output complies with a defined set of criteria. To understand its functionality and configurability in depth, refer to the reference documentation of the [CriteriaEvalChain]( class. ### Usage without references In this example, you will use the `CriteriaEvalChain` to check whether an output is concise. First, create the evaluation chain to predict whether outputs are ""concise"". ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", criteria=""conciseness"") # This is equivalent to loading using the enum from langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorType evaluator = load_evaluator(EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2?

The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'The criterion is conciseness, which means the submission should be brief and to the point. \\n\\nLooking at the submission, the answer to the question ""What\\\'s 2+2?"" is indeed ""four"". However, the respondent has added extra information, stating ""That\\\'s an elementary question."" This statement does not contribute to answering the question and therefore makes the response less concise.\\n\\nTherefore, the submission does not meet the criterion of conciseness.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` #### Output Format All string evaluators expose an [evaluate_strings]( (or async [aevaluate_strings]( method, which accepts: - input (str) The input to the agent. - prediction (str) The predicted response. The criteria evaluators return a dictionary with the following values: - score: Binary integer 0 to 1, where 1 would mean that the output is compliant with the criteria, and 0 otherwise - value: A ""Y"" or ""N"" corresponding to the score - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Using Reference Labels Some criteria (such as correctness) require reference labels to work correctly. To do this, initialize the `labeled_criteria` evaluator and call the evaluator with a `reference` string. ```python evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"") # We can even override the model\'s learned knowledge using ground truth labels eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( input=""What is the capital of the US?"", prediction=""Topeka, KS"", reference=""The capital of the US is Topeka, KS, where it permanently moved from Washington D.C. on May 16, 2023"", ) print(f\'With ground truth: {eval_result[""score""]}\') ``` ```text With ground truth: 1 ``` **Default Criteria** Most of the time, you\'ll want to define your own custom criteria (see below), but we also provide some common criteria you can load with a single string. Here\'s a list of pre-implemented criteria. Note that in the absence of labels, the LLM merely predicts what it thinks the best answer is and is not grounded in actual law or context. ```python from langchain.evaluation import Criteria # For a list of other default supported criteria, try calling `supported_default_criteria` list(Criteria) ``` ```text [, , , , , , , , , , ] ``` ## Custom Criteria To evaluate outputs against your own custom criteria, or to be more explicit the definition of any of the default criteria, pass in a dictionary of `""criterion_name"": ""criterion_description""` Note: it\'s recommended that you create a single evaluator per criterion. This way, separate feedback can be provided for each aspect. Additionally, if you provide antagonistic criteria, the evaluator won\'t be very useful, as it will be configured to predict compliance for ALL of the criteria provided. ```python custom_criterion = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric or mathematical information?"" } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criterion, ) query = ""Tell me a joke"" prediction = ""I ate some square pie but I don\'t know the square of pi."" eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(eval_result) # If you wanted to specify multiple criteria. Generally not recommended custom_criteria = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric information?"", ""mathematical"": ""Does the output contain mathematical information?"", ""grammatical"": ""Is the output grammatically correct?"", ""logical"": ""Is the output logical?"", } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criteria, ) eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(""Multi-criteria evaluation"") print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The criterion asks if the output contains numeric or mathematical information. The joke in the submission does contain mathematical information. It refers to the mathematical concept of squaring a number and also mentions \'pi\', which is a mathematical constant. Therefore, the submission does meet the criterion.\\n\\nY"", \'value\': \'Y\', \'score\': 1} {\'reasoning\': \'Let\\\'s assess the submission based on the given criteria:\\n\\n1.

Below, use an anthropic model instead. ```python # %pip install ChatAnthropic # %env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", llm=llm, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Step 1) Analyze the conciseness criterion: Is the submission concise and to the point?\\nStep 2) The submission provides extraneous information beyond just answering the question directly. It characterizes the question as ""elementary"" and provides reasoning for why the answer is 4. This additional commentary makes the submission not fully concise.\\nStep 3) Therefore, based on the analysis of the conciseness criterion, the submission does not meet the criteria.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` # Configuring the Prompt If you want to completely customize the prompt, you can initialize the evaluator with a custom prompt template as follows. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate fstring = """"""Respond Y or N based on how well the following response follows the specified rubric. Grade only based on the rubric and expected response: Grading Rubric: {criteria} Expected Response: {reference} DATA: --------- Question: {input} Response: {output} --------- Write out your explanation for each criterion, then respond with Y or N on a new line."""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(fstring) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"", prompt=prompt) ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", reference=""It\'s 17 now."", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Correctness: No, the response is not correct. The expected response was ""It\\\'s 17 now."" but the response given was ""What\\\'s 2+2? That\\\'s an elementary question. The answer you\\\'re looking for is that two and two is four.""\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Conclusion In these examples, you used the `CriteriaEvalChain` to evaluate model outputs against custom criteria, including a custom rubric and constitutional principles. Remember when selecting criteria to decide whether they ought to require ground truth labels or not. Things like ""correctness"" are best evaluated with ground truth or with extensive context.

54,What are intermediate steps in langchain?,"[""LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) | LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) LangChain Expression Language, or LCEL, is a declarative way to easily compose chains together. LCEL was designed from day 1 to **support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes**, from the simplest prompt + LLM chain to the most complex chains (we've seen folks successfully run LCEL chains with 100s of steps in production). To highlight a few of the reasons you might want to use LCEL: **Streaming support** When you build your chains with LCEL you get the best possible time-to-first-token (time elapsed until the first chunk of output comes out). For some chains this means eg. we stream tokens straight from an LLM to a streaming output parser, and you get back parsed, incremental chunks of output at the same rate as the LLM provider outputs the raw tokens. **Async support** Any chain built with LCEL can be called both with the synchronous API (eg. in your Jupyter notebook while prototyping) as well as with the asynchronous API (eg. in a [LangServe](/docs/langsmith) server). This enables using the same code for prototypes and in production, with great performance, and the ability to handle many concurrent requests in the same server. **Optimized parallel execution** Whenever your LCEL chains have steps that can be executed in parallel (eg if you fetch documents from multiple retrievers) we automatically do it, both in the sync and the async interfaces, for the smallest possible latency. **Retries and fallbacks** Configure retries and fallbacks for any part of your LCEL chain. This is a great way to make your chains more reliable at scale. We're currently working on adding streaming support for retries/fallbacks, so you can get the added reliability without any latency cost. **Access intermediate results** For more complex chains it's often very useful to access the results of intermediate steps even before the final output is produced. This can be used let end-users know something is happening, or even just to debug your chain. You can stream intermediate results, and it's available on every [LangServe](/docs/langserve) server. **Input and output schemas** Input and output schemas give every LCEL chain Pydantic and JSONSchema schemas inferred from the structure of your chain. This can be used for validation of inputs and outputs, and is an integral part of LangServe. **Seamless LangSmith tracing integration** As your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what exactly is happening at every step. With LCEL, **all** steps are automatically logged to [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith/) for maximum observability and debuggability. **Seamless LangServe deployment integration** Any chain created with LCEL can be easily deployed using [LangServe](/docs/langserve)."", 'Access intermediate steps | Access intermediate steps In order to get more visibility into what an agent is doing, we can also return intermediate steps.

To complete this tutorial, you will need [Docker]( and [Python 3.x]( installed. To follow along with this tutorial, ensure you have a running Memgraph instance. You can download and run it in a local Docker container by executing the following script: ```text docker run \\ -it \\ -p 7687:7687 \\ -p 7444:7444 \\ -p 3000:3000 \\ -e MEMGRAPH=""--bolt-server-name-for-init=Neo4j/"" \\ -v mg_lib:/var/lib/memgraph memgraph/memgraph-platform ``` You will need to wait a few seconds for the database to start. If the process completes successfully, you should see something like this: ```text mgconsole X.X Connected to \'memgraph://127.0.0.1:7687\' Type :help for shell usage Quit the shell by typing Ctrl-D(eof) or :quit memgraph> ``` Now you can start playing with Memgraph! Begin by installing and importing all the necessary packages. We\'ll use the package manager called [pip]( along with the `--user` flag, to ensure proper permissions. If you\'ve installed Python 3.4 or a later version, pip is included by default. You can install all the required packages using the following command: ```python pip install langchain openai neo4j gqlalchemy --user ``` You can either run the provided code blocks in this notebook or use a separate Python file to experiment with Memgraph and LangChain. ```python import os from gqlalchemy import Memgraph from langchain.chains import GraphCypherQAChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.graphs import MemgraphGraph from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` We\'re utilizing the Python library [GQLAlchemy]( to establish a connection between our Memgraph database and Python script. To execute queries, we can set up a Memgraph instance as follows: ```python memgraph = Memgraph(host=""127.0.0.1"", port=7687) ``` ## Populating the database You can effortlessly populate your new, empty database using the Cypher query language. Don\'t worry if you don\'t grasp every line just yet, you can learn Cypher from the documentation [here]( Running the following script will execute a seeding query on the database, giving us data about a video game, including details like the publisher, available platforms, and genres. This data will serve as a basis for our work. ```python # Creating and executing the seeding query query = """""" MERGE (g:Game {name: ""Baldur\'s Gate 3""}) WITH g, [""PlayStation 5"", ""Mac OS"", ""Windows"", ""Xbox Series X/S""] AS platforms, [""Adventure"", ""Role-Playing Game"", ""Strategy""] AS genres FOREACH (platform IN platforms | MERGE (p:Platform {name: platform}) MERGE (g)-[:AVAILABLE_ON]->(p) ) FOREACH (genre IN genres | MERGE (gn:Genre {name: genre}) MERGE (g)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(gn) ) MERGE (p:Publisher {name: ""Larian Studios""}) MERGE (g)-[:PUBLISHED_BY]->(p); """""" memgraph.execute(query) ``` ## Refresh graph schema You\'re all set to instantiate the Memgraph-LangChain graph using the following script. This interface will allow us to query our database using LangChain, automatically creating the required graph schema for generating Cypher queries through LLM. ```python graph = MemgraphGraph(url=""bolt://localhost:7687"", username="""", password="""") ``` If necessary, you can manually refresh the graph schema as follows. ```python graph.refresh_schema() ``` To familiarize yourself with the data and verify the updated graph schema, you can print it using the following statement. ```python print(graph.schema) ``` ```text Node properties are the following: Node name: \'Game\', Node properties: [{\'property\': \'name\', \'type\': \'str\'}] Node name: \'Platform\', Node properties: [{\'property\': \'name\', \'type\': \'str\'}] Node name: \'Genre\', Node properties: [{\'property\': \'name\', \'type\': \'str\'}] Node name: \'Publisher\', Node properties: [{\'property\': \'name\', \'type\': \'str\'}] Relationship properties are the following: The relationships are the following: [\'(:Game)-[:AVAILABLE_ON]->(:Platform)\'] [\'(:Game)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(:Genre)\'] [\'(:Game)-[:PUBLISHED_BY]->(:Publisher)\'] ``` ## Querying the database To interact with the OpenAI API, you must configure your API key as an environment variable using the Python [os]( package. This ensures proper authorization for your requests. You can find more information on obtaining your API key [here]( ```python os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = ""your-key-here"" ``` You should create the graph chain using the following script, which will be utilized in the question-answering process based on your graph data. While it defaults to GPT-3.5-turbo, you might also consider experimenting with other models like [GPT-4]( for notably improved Cypher queries and outcomes. We\'ll utilize the OpenAI chat, utilizing the key you previously configured. We\'ll set the temperature to zero, ensuring predictable and consistent answers. Additionally, we\'ll use our Memgraph-LangChain graph and set the verbose parameter, which defaults to False, to True to receive more detailed messages regarding query generation. ```python chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm( ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), graph=graph, verbose=True, model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"" ) ``` Now you can start asking questions! ```python response = chain.run(""Which platforms is Baldur\'s Gate 3 available on?"") print(response) ``` ```text > Entering new GraphCypherQAChain chain...

Yes, Baldur\'s Gate 3 is available on Windows. ``` ## Chain modifiers To modify the behavior of your chain and obtain more context or additional information, you can modify the chain\'s parameters. #### Return direct query results The `return_direct` modifier specifies whether to return the direct results of the executed Cypher query or the processed natural language response. ```python # Return the result of querying the graph directly chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm( ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), graph=graph, verbose=True, return_direct=True ) ``` ```python response = chain.run(""Which studio published Baldur\'s Gate 3?"") print(response) ``` ```text > Entering new GraphCypherQAChain chain... Generated Cypher: MATCH (:Game {name: \'Baldur\\\'s Gate 3\'})-[:PUBLISHED_BY]->(p:Publisher) RETURN p.name > Finished chain. [{\'p.name\': \'Larian Studios\'}] ``` #### Return query intermediate steps The `return_intermediate_steps` chain modifier enhances the returned response by including the intermediate steps of the query in addition to the initial query result. ```python # Return all the intermediate steps of query execution chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm( ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), graph=graph, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True ) ``` ```python response = chain(""Is Baldur\'s Gate 3 an Adventure game?"") print(f""Intermediate steps: {response[\'intermediate_steps\']}"") print(f""Final response: {response[\'result\']}"") ``` ```text > Entering new GraphCypherQAChain chain...

Baldur\'s Gate 3 is associated with the genres Adventure and Role-Playing Game. ``` # Advanced querying As the complexity of your solution grows, you might encounter different use-cases that require careful handling. Ensuring your application\'s scalability is essential to maintain a smooth user flow without any hitches. Let\'s instantiate our chain once again and attempt to ask some questions that users might potentially ask. ```python chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm( ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), graph=graph, verbose=True, model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"" ) ``` ```python response = chain.run(""Is Baldur\'s Gate 3 available on PS5?"") print(response) ``` ```text > Entering new GraphCypherQAChain chain... Generated Cypher: MATCH (g:Game {name: \'Baldur\\\'s Gate 3\'})-[:AVAILABLE_ON]->(p:Platform {name: \'PS5\'}) RETURN g.name, p.name Full Context: [] > Finished chain. I\'m sorry, but I don\'t have the information to answer your question. ``` The generated Cypher query looks fine, but we didn\'t receive any information in response. This illustrates a common challenge when working with LLMs - the misalignment between how users phrase queries and how data is stored. In this case, the difference between user perception and the actual data storage can cause mismatches. Prompt refinement, the process of honing the model\'s prompts to better grasp these distinctions, is an efficient solution that tackles this issue. Through prompt refinement, the model gains increased proficiency in generating precise and pertinent queries, leading to the successful retrieval of the desired data. ### Prompt refinement To address this, we can adjust the initial Cypher prompt of the QA chain. This involves adding guidance to the LLM on how users can refer to specific platforms, such as PS5 in our case. We achieve this using the LangChain [PromptTemplate]( creating a modified initial prompt. This modified prompt is then supplied as an argument to our refined Memgraph-LangChain instance. ```python CYPHER_GENERATION_TEMPLATE = """""" Task:Generate Cypher statement to query a graph database. Instructions: Use only the provided relationship types and properties in the schema. Do not use any other relationship types or properties that are not provided. Schema: {schema} Note: Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses. Do not respond to any questions that might ask anything else than for you to construct a Cypher statement. Do not include any text except the generated Cypher statement. If the user asks about PS5, Play Station 5 or PS 5, that is the platform called PlayStation 5. The question is: {question} """""" CYPHER_GENERATION_PROMPT = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""schema"", ""question""], template=CYPHER_GENERATION_TEMPLATE ) ``` ```python chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm( ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), cypher_prompt=CYPHER_GENERATION_PROMPT, graph=graph, verbose=True, model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) ``` ```python response = chain.run(""Is Baldur\'s Gate 3 available on PS5?"") print(response) ``` ```text > Entering new GraphCypherQAChain chain... Generated Cypher: MATCH (g:Game {name: \'Baldur\\\'s Gate 3\'})-[:AVAILABLE_ON]->(p:Platform {name: \'PlayStation 5\'}) RETURN g.name, p.name Full Context: [{\'g.name\': ""Baldur\'s Gate 3"", \'p.name\': \'PlayStation 5\'}] > Finished chain. Yes, Baldur\'s Gate 3 is available on PlayStation 5. ``` Now, with the revised initial Cypher prompt that includes guidance on platform naming, we are obtaining accurate and relevant results that align more closely with user queries. This approach allows for further improvement of your QA chain. You can effortlessly integrate extra prompt refinement data into your chain, thereby enhancing the overall user experience of your app. - [Populating the database](#populating-the-database) - [Refresh graph schema](#refresh-graph-schema) - [Querying the database](#querying-the-database) - [Chain modifiers](#chain-modifiers)- [Prompt refinement](#prompt-refinement)', 'Custom Trajectory Evaluator | Custom Trajectory Evaluator []( You can make your own custom trajectory evaluators by inheriting from the [AgentTrajectoryEvaluator]( class and overwriting the `_evaluate_agent_trajectory` (and `_aevaluate_agent_action`) method. In this example, you will make a simple trajectory evaluator that uses an LLM to determine if any actions were unnecessary. ```python from typing import Any, Optional, Sequence, Tuple from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.evaluation import AgentTrajectoryEvaluator from langchain.schema import AgentAction class StepNecessityEvaluator(AgentTrajectoryEvaluator): """"""Evaluate the perplexity of a predicted string."""""" def __init__(self) -> None: llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"", temperature=0.0) template = """"""Are any of the following steps unnecessary in answering {input}?

It returns the string \'decision\' as the \'value\', and includes the rest of the generated text as \'reasoning\' to let you audit the decision. You can call this evaluator to grade the intermediate steps of your agent\'s trajectory. ```python evaluator = StepNecessityEvaluator() evaluator.evaluate_agent_trajectory( prediction=""The answer is pi"", input=""What is today?"", agent_trajectory=[ ( AgentAction(tool=""ask"", tool_input=""What is today?"", log=""""), ""tomorrow\'s yesterday"", ), ( AgentAction(tool=""check_tv"", tool_input=""Watch tv for half hour"", log=""""), ""bzzz"", ), ], ) ``` ```text {\'score\': 1, \'value\': \'Y\', \'reasoning\': \'Y\'} ```']","Intermediate steps in LangChain are the actions and observations returned during the execution of an agent's chain, before the final output is produced.

Therefore, as you go to move your LLM applications into production it becomes more and more important to safeguard against these. That\'s why we\'ve introduced the concept of fallbacks. A **fallback** is an alternative plan that may be used in an emergency. Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. This is important because often times different models require different prompts. So if your call to OpenAI fails, you don\'t just want to send the same prompt to Anthropic - you probably want to use a different prompt template and send a different version there. ## Fallback for LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things. Therefore, using fallbacks can help protect against these types of things. IMPORTANT: By default, a lot of the LLM wrappers catch errors and retry. You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying and not failing. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI ``` First, let\'s mock out what happens if we hit a RateLimitError from OpenAI ```python from unittest.mock import patch from openai.error import RateLimitError ``` ```python # Note that we set max_retries = 0 to avoid retrying on RateLimits, etc openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0) anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic() llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm]) ``` ```python # Let\'s use just the OpenAI LLm first, to show that we run into an error with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(openai_llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ```python # Now let\'s try with fallbacks to Anthropic with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content=\' I don\\\'t actually know why the chicken crossed the road, but here are some possible humorous answers:\\n\\n- To get to the other side!\\n\\n- It was too chicken to just stand there. \\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\n- It wanted to show the possum it could be done.\\n\\n- It was on its way to a poultry farmers\\\' convention.\\n\\nThe joke plays on the double meaning of ""the other side"" - literally crossing the road to the other side, or the ""other side"" meaning the afterlife. So it\\\'s an anti-joke, with a silly or unexpected pun as the answer.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` We can use our ""LLM with Fallbacks"" as we would a normal LLM. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content="" I don\'t actually know why the kangaroo crossed the road, but I can take a guess! Here are some possible reasons:\\n\\n- To get to the other side (the classic joke answer!)\\n\\n- It was trying to find some food or water \\n\\n- It was trying to find a mate during mating season\\n\\n- It was fleeing from a predator or perceived threat\\n\\n- It was disoriented and crossed accidentally \\n\\n- It was following a herd of other kangaroos who were crossing\\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery or environment \\n\\n- It was trying to reach a new habitat or territory\\n\\nThe real reason is unknown without more context, but hopefully one of those potential explanations does the joke justice! Let me know if you have any other animal jokes I can try to decipher."" additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback for Sequences We can also create fallbacks for sequences, that are sequences themselves. Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model). Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt. ```python # First let\'s create a chain with a ChatModel # We add in a string output parser here so the outputs between the two are the same type from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) # Here we\'re going to use a bad model name to easily create a chain that will error chat_model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"") bad_chain = chat_prompt | chat_model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python # Now lets create a chain with the normal OpenAI model from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = """"""Instructions: You should always include a compliment in your response. Question: Why did the {animal} cross the road?"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template) llm = OpenAI() good_chain = prompt | llm ``` ```python # We can now create a final chain which combines the two chain = bad_chain.with_fallbacks([good_chain]) chain.invoke({""animal"": ""turtle""}) ``` ```text \'\\n\\nAnswer: The turtle crossed the road to get to the other side, and I have to say he had some impressive determination.\' ``` ## Fallback for Long Inputs One of the big limiting factors of LLMs is their context window. Usually, you can count and track the length of prompts before sending them to an LLM, but in situations where that is hard/complicated, you can fallback to a model with a longer context length. ```python short_llm = ChatOpenAI() long_llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"") llm = short_llm.with_fallbacks([long_llm]) ``` ```python inputs = ""What is the next number: "" + "", "".join([""one"", ""two""] * 3000) ``` ```python try: print(short_llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text This model\'s maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 12012 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages. ``` ```python try: print(llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text content=\'The next number in the sequence is two.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback to Better Model Often times we ask models to output format in a specific format (like JSON). Models like GPT-3.5 can do this okay, but sometimes struggle. This naturally points to fallbacks - we can try with GPT-3.5 (faster, cheaper), but then if parsing fails we can use GPT-4. ```python from langchain.output_parsers import DatetimeOutputParser ``` ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template( ""what time was {event} (in %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ format - only return this value)"" ) ``` ```python # In this case we are going to do the fallbacks on the LLM + output parser level # Because the error will get raised in the OutputParser openai_35 = ChatOpenAI() | DatetimeOutputParser() openai_4 = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"") | DatetimeOutputParser() ``` ```python only_35 = prompt | openai_35 fallback_4 = prompt | openai_35.with_fallbacks([openai_4]) ``` ```python try: print(only_35.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text Error: Could not parse datetime string: The Super Bowl in 1994 took place on January 30th at 3:30 PM local time. Converting this to the specified format (%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ) results in: 1994-01-30T15:30:00.000Z ``` ```python try: print(fallback_4.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text 1994-01-30 15:30:00 ``` - [Fallback for LLM API Errors](#fallback-for-llm-api-errors) - [Fallback for Sequences](#fallback-for-sequences) - [Fallback for Long Inputs](#fallback-for-long-inputs) - [Fallback to Better Model](#fallback-to-better-model)', 'Reddit | Reddit [Reddit]( is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website.

56,What's function calling,"['Vespa | Vespa [Vespa]( is a fully featured search engine and vector database. It supports vector search (ANN), lexical search, and search in structured data, all in the same query. This notebook shows how to use `Vespa.ai` as a LangChain vector store. In order to create the vector store, we use [pyvespa]( to create a connection a `Vespa` service. ```python #!pip install pyvespa ``` Using the `pyvespa` package, you can either connect to a [Vespa Cloud instance]( or a local [Docker instance]( Here, we will create a new Vespa application and deploy that using Docker. #### Creating a Vespa application First, we need to create an application package: ```python from vespa.package import ApplicationPackage, Field, RankProfile app_package = ApplicationPackage(name=""testapp"") app_package.schema.add_fields( Field( name=""text"", type=""string"", indexing=[""index"", ""summary""], index=""enable-bm25"" ), Field( name=""embedding"", type=""tensor(x[384])"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""], attribute=[""distance-metric: angular""], ), ) app_package.schema.add_rank_profile( RankProfile( name=""default"", first_phase=""closeness(field, embedding)"", inputs=[(""query(query_embedding)"", ""tensor(x[384])"")], ) ) ``` This sets up a Vespa application with a schema for each document that contains two fields: `text` for holding the document text and `embedding` for holding the embedding vector. The `text` field is set up to use a BM25 index for efficient text retrieval, and we\'ll see how to use this and hybrid search a bit later. The `embedding` field is set up with a vector of length 384 to hold the embedding representation of the text. See [Vespa\'s Tensor Guide]( for more on tensors in Vespa. Lastly, we add a [rank profile]( to instruct Vespa how to order documents. Here we set this up with a [nearest neighbor search]( Now we can deploy this application locally: ```python from vespa.deployment import VespaDocker vespa_docker = VespaDocker() vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) ``` This deploys and creates a connection to a `Vespa` service. In case you already have a Vespa application running, for instance in the cloud, please refer to the PyVespa application for how to connect. #### Creating a Vespa vector store Now, let\'s load some documents: ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter loader = TextLoader(""../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) from langchain.embeddings.sentence_transformer import SentenceTransformerEmbeddings embedding_function = SentenceTransformerEmbeddings(model_name=""all-MiniLM-L6-v2"") ``` Here, we also set up local sentence embedder to transform the text to embedding vectors. One could also use OpenAI embeddings, but the vector length needs to be updated to `1536` to reflect the larger size of that embedding. To feed these to Vespa, we need to configure how the vector store should map to fields in the Vespa application. Then we create the vector store directly from this set of documents: ```python vespa_config = dict( page_content_field=""text"", embedding_field=""embedding"", input_field=""query_embedding"", ) from langchain.vectorstores import VespaStore db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) ``` This creates a Vespa vector store and feeds that set of documents to Vespa. The vector store takes care of calling the embedding function for each document and inserts them into the database. We can now query the vector store: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query) print(results[0].page_content) ``` This will use the embedding function given above to create a representation for the query and use that to search Vespa. Note that this will use the `default` ranking function, which we set up in the application package above. You can use the `ranking` argument to `similarity_search` to specify which ranking function to use. Please refer to the [pyvespa documentation]( for more information. This covers the basic usage of the Vespa store in LangChain. Now you can return the results and continue using these in LangChain. #### Updating documents An alternative to calling `from_documents`, you can create the vector store directly and call `add_texts` from that. This can also be used to update documents: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query) result = results[0] result.page_content = ""UPDATED: "" + result.page_content db.add_texts([result.page_content], [result.metadata], result.metadata[""id""]) results = db.similarity_search(query) print(results[0].page_content) ``` However, the `pyvespa` library contains methods to manipulate content on Vespa which you can use directly. #### Deleting documents You can delete documents using the `delete` function: ```python result = db.similarity_search(query) # docs[0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" db.delete([""32""]) result = db.similarity_search(query) # docs[0].metadata[""id""] != ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" ``` Again, the `pyvespa` connection contains methods to delete documents as well. ### Returning with scores The `similarity_search` method only returns the documents in order of relevancy. To retrieve the actual scores: ```python results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query) result = results[0] # result[1] ~= 0.463 ``` This is a result of using the `""all-MiniLM-L6-v2""` embedding model using the cosine distance function (as given by the argument `angular` in the application function). Different embedding functions need different distance functions, and Vespa needs to know which distance function to use when orderings documents. Please refer to the [documentation on distance functions]( for more information. ### As retriever To use this vector store as a [LangChain retriever]( simply call the `as_retriever` function, which is a standard vector store method: ```python db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) retriever = db.as_retriever() query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) # results[0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" ``` This allows for more general, unstructured, retrieval from the vector store. ### Metadata In the example so far, we\'ve only used the text and the embedding for that text. Documents usually contain additional information, which in LangChain is referred to as metadata. Vespa can contain many fields with different types by adding them to the application package: ```python app_package.schema.add_fields( # ... Field(name=""date"", type=""string"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""]), Field(name=""rating"", type=""int"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""]), Field(name=""author"", type=""string"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""]), # ... ) vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) ``` We can add some metadata fields in the documents: ```python # Add metadata for i, doc in enumerate(docs): doc.metadata[""date""] = f""2023-{(i % 12)+1}-{(i % 28)+1}"" doc.metadata[""rating""] = range(1, 6)[i % 5] doc.metadata[""author""] = [""Joe Biden"", ""Unknown""][min(i, 1)] ``` And let the Vespa vector store know about these fields: ```python vespa_config.update(dict(metadata_fields=[""date"", ""rating"", ""author""])) ``` Now, when searching for these documents, these fields will be returned. Also, these fields can be filtered on: ```python db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query, filter=""rating > 3"") # results[0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::34"" # results[0].metadata[""author""] == ""Unknown"" ``` ### Custom query If the default behavior of the similarity search does not fit your requirements, you can always provide your own query. Thus, you don\'t need to provide all of the configuration to the vector store, but rather just write this yourself. First, let\'s add a BM25 ranking function to our application: ```python from vespa.package import FieldSet app_package.schema.add_field_set(FieldSet(name=""default"", fields=[""text""])) app_package.schema.add_rank_profile(RankProfile(name=""bm25"", first_phase=""bm25(text)"")) vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) ``` Then, to perform a regular text search based on BM25: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" custom_query = { ""yql"": ""select * from sources * where userQuery()"", ""query"": query, ""type"": ""weakAnd"", ""ranking"": ""bm25"", ""hits"": 4, } results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query, custom_query=custom_query) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" # results[0][1] ~= 14.384 ``` All of the powerful search and query capabilities of Vespa can be used by using a custom query. Please refer to the Vespa documentation on it\'s [Query API]( for more details. ### Hybrid search Hybrid search means using both a classic term-based search such as BM25 and a vector search and combining the results. We need to create a new rank profile for hybrid search on Vespa: ```python app_package.schema.add_rank_profile( RankProfile( name=""hybrid"", first_phase=""log(bm25(text)) + 0.5 * closeness(field, embedding)"", inputs=[(""query(query_embedding)"", ""tensor(x[384])"")], ) ) vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) ``` Here, we score each document as a combination of it\'s BM25 score and its distance score. We can query using a custom query: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" query_embedding = embedding_function.embed_query(query) nearest_neighbor_expression = ( ""{targetHits: 4}nearestNeighbor(embedding, query_embedding)"" ) custom_query = { ""yql"": f""select * from sources * where {nearest_neighbor_expression} and userQuery()"", ""query"": query, ""type"": ""weakAnd"", ""input.query(query_embedding)"": query_embedding, ""ranking"": ""hybrid"", ""hits"": 4, } results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query, custom_query=custom_query) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""], ""id:testapp:testapp::32"") # results[0][1] ~= 2.897 ``` ### Native embedders in Vespa Up until this point we\'ve used an embedding function in Python to provide embeddings for the texts. Vespa supports embedding function natively, so you can defer this calculation in to Vespa. One benefit is the ability to use GPUs when embedding documents if you have a large collections. Please refer to [Vespa embeddings]( for more information. First, we need to modify our application package: ```python from vespa.package import Component, Parameter app_package.components = [ Component( id=""hf-embedder"", type=""hugging-face-embedder"", parameters=[ Parameter(""transformer-model"", {""path"": ""...""}), Parameter(""tokenizer-model"", {""url"": ""...""}), ], ) ] Field( name=""hfembedding"", type=""tensor(x[384])"", is_document_field=False, indexing=[""input text"", ""embed hf-embedder"", ""attribute"", ""summary""], attribute=[""distance-metric: angular""], ) app_package.schema.add_rank_profile( RankProfile( name=""hf_similarity"", first_phase=""closeness(field, hfembedding)"", inputs=[(""query(query_embedding)"", ""tensor(x[384])"")], ) ) ``` Please refer to the embeddings documentation on adding embedder models and tokenizers to the application. Note that the `hfembedding` field includes instructions for embedding using the `hf-embedder`. Now we can query with a custom query: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" nearest_neighbor_expression = ( ""{targetHits: 4}nearestNeighbor(internalembedding, query_embedding)"" ) custom_query = { ""yql"": f""select * from sources * where {nearest_neighbor_expression}"", ""input.query(query_embedding)"": f\'embed(hf-embedder, ""{query}"")\', ""ranking"": ""internal_similarity"", ""hits"": 4, } results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query, custom_query=custom_query) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""], ""id:testapp:testapp::32"") # results[0][1] ~= 0.630 ``` Note that the query here includes an `embed` instruction to embed the query using the same model as for the documents. ### Approximate nearest neighbor In all of the above examples, we\'ve used exact nearest neighbor to find results. However, for large collections of documents this is not feasible as one has to scan through all documents to find the best matches. To avoid this, we can use [approximate nearest neighbors]( First, we can change the embedding field to create a HNSW index: ```python from vespa.package import HNSW app_package.schema.add_fields( Field( name=""embedding"", type=""tensor(x[384])"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary"", ""index""], ann=HNSW( distance_metric=""angular"", max_links_per_node=16, neighbors_to_explore_at_insert=200, ), ) ) ``` This creates a HNSW index on the embedding data which allows for efficient searching. With this set, we can easily search using ANN by setting the `approximate` argument to `True`: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query, approximate=True) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""], ""id:testapp:testapp::32"") ``` This covers most of the functionality in the Vespa vector store in LangChain. - [Returning with scores](#returning-with-scores) - [As retriever](#as-retriever) - [Metadata](#metadata) - [Custom query](#custom-query) - [Hybrid search](#hybrid-search) - [Native embedders in Vespa](#native-embedders-in-vespa) - [Approximate nearest neighbor](#approximate-nearest-neighbor)', 'OpenAI assistants | OpenAI assistants The [Assistants API]( allows you to build AI assistants within your own applications. An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API currently supports three types of tools: Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function calling You can interact with OpenAI Assistants using OpenAI tools or custom tools. When using exclusively OpenAI tools, you can just invoke the assistant directly and get final answers. When using custom tools, you can run the assistant and tool execution loop using the built-in AgentExecutor or easily write your own executor. Below we show the different ways to interact with Assistants. As a simple example, let\'s build a math tutor that can write and run code. ### Using only OpenAI tools ```python from langchain.agents.openai_assistant import OpenAIAssistantRunnable ``` ```python interpreter_assistant = OpenAIAssistantRunnable.create_assistant( name=""langchain assistant"", instructions=""You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions."", tools=[{""type"": ""code_interpreter""}], model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"", ) output = interpreter_assistant.invoke({""content"": ""What\'s 10 - 4 raised to the 2.7""}) output ``` ```text [ThreadMessage(id=\'msg_qgxkD5kvkZyl0qOaL4czPFkZ\', assistant_id=\'asst_0T8S7CJuUa4Y4hm1PF6n62v7\', content=[MessageContentText(text=Text(annotations=[], value=\'The result of the calculation \\\\(10 - 4^{2.7}\\\\) is approximately \\\\(-32.224\\\\).\'), type=\'text\')], created_at=1700169519, file_ids=[], metadata={}, object=\'thread.message\', role=\'assistant\', run_id=\'run_aH3ZgSWNk3vYIBQm3vpE8tr4\', thread_id=\'thread_9K6cYfx1RBh0pOWD8SxwVWW9\')] ``` ### As a LangChain agent with arbitrary tools Now let\'s recreate this functionality using our own tools. For this example we\'ll use the [E2B sandbox runtime tool]( ```bash pip install e2b duckduckgo-search ``` ```python import getpass from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun, E2BDataAnalysisTool tools = [E2BDataAnalysisTool(api_key=getpass.getpass()), DuckDuckGoSearchRun()] ``` ```python agent = OpenAIAssistantRunnable.create_assistant( name=""langchain assistant e2b tool"", instructions=""You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions. You can also search the internet."", tools=tools, model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"", as_agent=True, ) ``` #### Using AgentExecutor The OpenAIAssistantRunnable is compatible with the AgentExecutor, so we can pass it in as an agent directly to the executor. The AgentExecutor handles calling the invoked tools and uploading the tool outputs back to the Assistants API. Plus it comes with built-in LangSmith tracing. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools) agent_executor.invoke({""content"": ""What\'s the weather in SF today divided by 2.7""}) ``` ```text {\'content\': ""What\'s the weather in SF today divided by 2.7"", \'output\': ""The search results indicate that the weather in San Francisco is 67 F. Now I will divide this temperature by 2.7 and provide you with the result. Please note that this is a mathematical operation and does not represent a meaningful physical quantity.\\n\\nLet\'s calculate 67 F divided by 2.7.\\nThe result of dividing the current temperature in San Francisco, which is 67 F, by 2.7 is approximately 24.815."", \'thread_id\': \'thread_hcpYI0tfpB9mHa9d95W7nK2B\', \'run_id\': \'run_qOuVmPXS9xlV3XNPcfP8P9W2\'} ``` [LangSmith trace]( Custom execution Or with LCEL we can easily write our own execution loop for running the assistant. This gives us full control over execution. ```python agent = OpenAIAssistantRunnable.create_assistant( name=""langchain assistant e2b tool"", instructions=""You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions."", tools=tools, model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"", as_agent=True, ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.agent import AgentFinish def execute_agent(agent, tools, input): tool_map = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools} response = agent.invoke(input) while not isinstance(response, AgentFinish): tool_outputs = [] for action in response: tool_output = tool_map[action.tool].invoke(action.tool_input) print(action.tool, action.tool_input, tool_output, end=""\\n\\n"") tool_outputs.append( {""output"": tool_output, ""tool_call_id"": action.tool_call_id} ) response = agent.invoke( { ""tool_outputs"": tool_outputs, ""run_id"": action.run_id, ""thread_id"": action.thread_id, } ) return response ``` ```python response = execute_agent(agent, tools, {""content"": ""What\'s 10 - 4 raised to the 2.7""}) print(response.return_values[""output""]) ``` ```text e2b_data_analysis {\'python_code\': \'result = 10 - 4 ** 2.7\\nprint(result)\'} {""stdout"": ""-32.22425314473263"", ""stderr"": """", ""artifacts"": []} \\( 10 - 4^{2.7} \\) equals approximately -32.224. ``` ## Using existing Thread To use an existing thread we just need to pass the ""thread_id"" in when invoking the agent. ```python next_response = execute_agent( agent, tools, {""content"": ""now add 17.241"", ""thread_id"": response.return_values[""thread_id""]}, ) print(next_response.return_values[""output""]) ``` ```text e2b_data_analysis {\'python_code\': \'result = 10 - 4 ** 2.7 + 17.241\\nprint(result)\'} {""stdout"": ""-14.983253144732629"", ""stderr"": """", ""artifacts"": []} \\( 10 - 4^{2.7} + 17.241 \\) equals approximately -14.983. ``` ## Using existing Assistant To use an existing Assistant we can initialize the `OpenAIAssistantRunnable` directly with an `assistant_id`. ```python agent = OpenAIAssistantRunnable(assistant_id="""", as_agent=True) ``` - [Using only OpenAI tools](#using-only-openai-tools) - [As a LangChain agent with arbitrary tools](#as-a-langchain-agent-with-arbitrary-tools) - [Using existing Thread](#using-existing-thread) - [Using existing Assistant](#using-existing-assistant)', 'Dynamically route logic based on input | Dynamically route logic based on input This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language. Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`.

These can be called from LangChain either through this local pipeline wrapper or by calling their hosted inference endpoints through the HuggingFaceHub class. For more information on the hosted pipelines, see the [HuggingFaceHub](/docs/integrations/llms/huggingface_hub.html) notebook. To use, you should have the `transformers` python [package installed]( as well as [pytorch]( You can also install `xformer` for a more memory-efficient attention implementation. ```python %pip install transformers --quiet ``` ### Model Loading Models can be loaded by specifying the model parameters using the `from_model_id` method. ```python from langchain.llms.huggingface_pipeline import HuggingFacePipeline hf = HuggingFacePipeline.from_model_id( model_id=""gpt2"", task=""text-generation"", pipeline_kwargs={""max_new_tokens"": 10}, ) ``` They can also be loaded by passing in an existing `transformers` pipeline directly ```python from langchain.llms.huggingface_pipeline import HuggingFacePipeline from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline model_id = ""gpt2"" tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id) model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id) pipe = pipeline(""text-generation"", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, max_new_tokens=10) hf = HuggingFacePipeline(pipeline=pipe) ``` ### Create Chain With the model loaded into memory, you can compose it with a prompt to form a chain. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate template = """"""Question: {question} Answer: Let\'s think step by step."""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template) chain = prompt | hf question = ""What is electroencephalography?"" print(chain.invoke({""question"": question})) ``` ### GPU Inference When running on a machine with GPU, you can specify the `device=n` parameter to put the model on the specified device. Defaults to `-1` for CPU inference. If you have multiple-GPUs and/or the model is too large for a single GPU, you can specify `device_map=""auto""`, which requires and uses the [Accelerate]( library to automatically determine how to load the model weights. _Note_: both `device` and `device_map` should not be specified together and can lead to unexpected behavior. ```python gpu_llm = HuggingFacePipeline.from_model_id( model_id=""gpt2"", task=""text-generation"", device=0, # replace with device_map=""auto"" to use the accelerate library. pipeline_kwargs={""max_new_tokens"": 10}, ) gpu_chain = prompt | gpu_llm question = ""What is electroencephalography?"" print(gpu_chain.invoke({""question"": question})) ``` ### Batch GPU Inference If running on a device with GPU, you can also run inference on the GPU in batch mode. ```python gpu_llm = HuggingFacePipeline.from_model_id( model_id=""bigscience/bloom-1b7"", task=""text-generation"", device=0, # -1 for CPU batch_size=2, # adjust as needed based on GPU map and model size. model_kwargs={""temperature"": 0, ""max_length"": 64}, ) gpu_chain = prompt | gpu_llm.bind(stop=[""\\n\\n""]) questions = [] for i in range(4): questions.append({""question"": f""What is the number {i} in french?""}) answers = gpu_chain.batch(questions) for answer in answers: print(answer) ``` - [Model Loading](#model-loading) - [Create Chain](#create-chain) - [GPU Inference](#gpu-inference) - [Batch GPU Inference](#batch-gpu-inference)', 'LangSmith LLM Runs | LangSmith LLM Runs This notebook demonstrates how to directly load data from LangSmith\'s LLM runs and fine-tune a model on that data.

Fine-tune the model Now, initiate the fine-tuning process using the OpenAI library. ```python import json import time from io import BytesIO import openai my_file = BytesIO() for dialog in training_data: my_file.write((json.dumps({""messages"": dialog}) + ""\\n"").encode(""utf-8"")) my_file.seek(0) training_file = openai.File.create(file=my_file, purpose=""fine-tune"") job = openai.FineTuningJob.create( training_file=training_file.id, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) # Wait for the fine-tuning to complete (this may take some time) status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""succeeded"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status # Now your model is fine-tuned! ``` ```text Status=[running]... 346.26s. 31.70s ``` ## 4. Use in LangChain After fine-tuning, use the resulting model ID with the ChatOpenAI model class in your LangChain app. ```python # Get the fine-tuned model ID job = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id) model_id = job.fine_tuned_model # Use the fine-tuned model in LangChain model = ChatOpenAI( model=model_id, temperature=1, ) ``` ```python (prompt | model).invoke({""input"": ""What\'s 56/7?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'{\\n ""num1"": 56,\\n ""num2"": 7,\\n ""operation"": ""/""\\n}\') ``` Now you have successfully fine-tuned a model using data from LangSmith LLM runs! - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) - [1.

[Sign up here]( to get on the waitlist. ## Overview `LangServe` helps developers deploy `LangChain` [runnables and chains]( as a REST API. This library is integrated with [FastAPI]( and uses [pydantic]( for data validation. In addition, it provides a client that can be used to call into runnables deployed on a server. A javascript client is available in [LangChainJS]( ## Features - Input and Output schemas automatically inferred from your LangChain object, and enforced on every API call, with rich error messages - API docs page with JSONSchema and Swagger (insert example link) - Efficient `/invoke`, `/batch` and `/stream` endpoints with support for many concurrent requests on a single server - `/stream_log` endpoint for streaming all (or some) intermediate steps from your chain/agent - Playground page at `/playground` with streaming output and intermediate steps - Built-in (optional) tracing to [LangSmith]( just add your API key (see [Instructions]( - All built with battle-tested open-source Python libraries like FastAPI, Pydantic, uvloop and asyncio. - Use the client SDK to call a LangServe server as if it was a Runnable running locally (or call the HTTP API directly) - [LangServe Hub]( ### Limitations - Client callbacks are not yet supported for events that originate on the server - OpenAPI docs will not be generated when using Pydantic V2. Fast API does not support [mixing pydantic v1 and v2 namespaces]( See section below for more details. ## Hosted LangServe We will be releasing a hosted version of LangServe for one-click deployments of LangChain applications. [Sign up here]( to get on the waitlist. ## Security - Vulnerability in Versions 0.0.13 - 0.0.15 -- playground endpoint allows accessing arbitrary files on server. [Resolved in 0.0.16]( ## Installation For both client and server: ```bash pip install ""langserve[all]"" ``` or `pip install ""langserve[client]""` for client code, and `pip install ""langserve[server]""` for server code. ## LangChain CLI Use the `LangChain` CLI to bootstrap a `LangServe` project quickly. To use the langchain CLI make sure that you have a recent version of `langchain-cli` installed. You can install it with `pip install -U langchain-cli`. ```sh langchain app new ../path/to/directory ``` ## Examples Get your LangServe instance started quickly with [LangChain Templates]( For more examples, see the templates [index]( or the [examples]( directory. ### Server Here\'s a server that deploys an OpenAI chat model, an Anthropic chat model, and a chain that uses the Anthropic model to tell a joke about a topic. ```python #!/usr/bin/env python from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI from langserve import add_routes app = FastAPI( title=""LangChain Server"", version=""1.0"", description=""A simple api server using Langchain\'s Runnable interfaces"", ) add_routes( app, ChatOpenAI(), path=""/openai"", ) add_routes( app, ChatAnthropic(), path=""/anthropic"", ) model = ChatAnthropic() prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""tell me a joke about {topic}"") add_routes( app, prompt | model, path=""/joke"", ) if __name__ == ""__main__"": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, host=""localhost"", port=8000) ``` ### Docs If you\'ve deployed the server above, you can view the generated OpenAPI docs using: If using pydantic v2, docs will not be generated for invoke/batch/stream/stream_log. See [Pydantic](#pydantic) section below for more details. ```sh curl localhost:8000/docs ``` make sure to **add** the `/docs` suffix. Index page `/` is not defined by **design**, so `curl localhost:8000` or visiting the URL will return a 404. If you want content at `/` define an endpoint `@app.get(""/"")`. ### Client Python SDK ```python from langchain.schema import SystemMessage, HumanMessage from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableMap from langserve import RemoteRunnable openai = RemoteRunnable("" anthropic = RemoteRunnable("" joke_chain = RemoteRunnable("" joke_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""parrots""}) # or async await joke_chain.ainvoke({""topic"": ""parrots""}) prompt = [ SystemMessage(content=\'Act like either a cat or a parrot.\'), HumanMessage(content=\'Hello!\') ] # Supports astream async for msg in anthropic.astream(prompt): print(msg, end="""", flush=True) prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [(""system"", ""Tell me a long story about {topic}"")] ) # Can define custom chains chain = prompt | RunnableMap({ ""openai"": openai, ""anthropic"": anthropic, }) chain.batch([{ ""topic"": ""parrots"" }, { ""topic"": ""cats"" }]) ``` In TypeScript (requires LangChain.js version 0.0.166 or later): ```typescript import { RemoteRunnable } from ""langchain/runnables/remote""; const chain = new RemoteRunnable({ url: ` }); const result = await chain.invoke({ topic: ""cats"", }); ``` Python using `requests`: ```python import requests response = requests.post( "" json={\'input\': {\'topic\': \'cats\'}} ) response.json() ``` You can also use `curl`: ```sh curl --location --request POST \' \\ --header \'Content-Type: application/json\' \\ --data-raw \'{ ""input"": { ""topic"": ""cats"" } }\' ``` ## Endpoints The following code: ```python ... add_routes( app, runnable, path=""/my_runnable"", ) ``` adds of these endpoints to the server: - `POST /my_runnable/invoke` - invoke the runnable on a single input - `POST /my_runnable/batch` - invoke the runnable on a batch of inputs - `POST /my_runnable/stream` - invoke on a single input and stream the output - `POST /my_runnable/stream_log` - invoke on a single input and stream the output, including output of intermediate steps as it\'s generated - `GET /my_runnable/input_schema` - json schema for input to the runnable - `GET /my_runnable/output_schema` - json schema for output of the runnable - `GET /my_runnable/config_schema` - json schema for config of the runnable These endpoints match the [LangChain Expression Language interface]( -- please reference this documentation for more details. ## Playground You can find a playground page for your runnable at `/my_runnable/playground`. This exposes a simple UI to [configure]( and invoke your runnable with streaming output and intermediate steps. ![]( ### Widgets The playground supports [widgets](#playground-widgets) and can be used to test your runnable with different inputs. In addition, for configurable runnables, the playground will allow you to configure the runnable and share a link with the configuration: ### Sharing ![]( ## Legacy Chains LangServe works with both Runnables (constructed via [LangChain Expression Language]( and legacy chains (inheriting from `Chain`). However, some of the input schemas for legacy chains may be incomplete/incorrect, leading to errors. This can be fixed by updating the `input_schema` property of those chains in LangChain. If you encounter any errors, please open an issue on THIS repo, and we will work to address it. ## Deployment ### Deploy to GCP You can deploy to GCP Cloud Run using the following command: ```text gcloud run deploy [your-service-name] --source . --port 8001 --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1 --set-env-vars=OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key ``` ## Pydantic LangServe provides support for Pydantic 2 with some limitations. 1. OpenAPI docs will not be generated for invoke/batch/stream/stream_log when using Pydantic V2. Fast API does not support [mixing pydantic v1 and v2 namespaces] . 2. LangChain uses the v1 namespace in Pydantic v2. Please read the [following guidelines to ensure compatibility with LangChain]( Except for these limitations, we expect the API endpoints, the playground and any other features to work as expected. ## Advanced ## Handling Authentication If you need to add authentication to your server, please reference FastAPI\'s [security documentation]( and [middleware documentation]( ### Files LLM applications often deal with files. There are different architectures that can be made to implement file processing; at a high level: 1. The file may be uploaded to the server via a dedicated endpoint and processed using a separate endpoint 2. The file may be uploaded by either value (bytes of file) or reference (e.g., s3 url to file content) 3. The processing endpoint may be blocking or non-blocking 4. If significant processing is required, the processing may be offloaded to a dedicated process pool You should determine what is the appropriate architecture for your application. Currently, to upload files by value to a runnable, use base64 encoding for the file (`multipart/form-data` is not supported yet). Here\'s an [example]( that shows how to use base64 encoding to send a file to a remote runnable. Remember, you can always upload files by reference (e.g., s3 url) or upload them as multipart/form-data to a dedicated endpoint. ### Custom Input and Output Types Input and Output types are defined on all runnables. You can access them via the `input_schema` and `output_schema` properties. `LangServe` uses these types for validation and documentation. If you want to override the default inferred types, you can use the `with_types` method. Here\'s a toy example to illustrate the idea: ```python from typing import Any from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda app = FastAPI() def func(x: Any) -> int: """"""Mistyped function that should accept an int but accepts anything."""""" return x + 1 runnable = RunnableLambda(func).with_types( input_schema=int, ) add_routes(app, runnable) ``` ### Custom User Types Inherit from `CustomUserType` if you want the data to de-serialize into a pydantic model rather than the equivalent dict representation. At the moment, this type only works _server_ side and is used to specify desired _decoding_ behavior. If inheriting from this type the server will keep the decoded type as a pydantic model instead of converting it into a dict. ```python from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda from langserve import add_routes from langserve.schema import CustomUserType app = FastAPI() class Foo(CustomUserType): bar: int def func(foo: Foo) -> int: """"""Sample function that expects a Foo type which is a pydantic model"""""" assert isinstance(foo, Foo) return foo.bar # Note that the input and output type are automatically inferred! # You do not need to specify them. # runnable = RunnableLambda(func).with_types( # <-- Not needed in this case # input_schema=Foo, # output_schema=int, # add_routes(app, RunnableLambda(func), path=""/foo"") ``` ### Playground Widgets\u200b The playground allows you to define custom widgets for your runnable from the backend. - A widget is specified at the field level and shipped as part of the JSON schema of the input type - A widget must contain a key called `type` with the value being one of a well known list of widgets - Other widget keys will be associated with values that describe paths in a JSON object General schema: ```typescript type JsonPath = number | string | (number | string)[]; type NameSpacedPath = { title: string; path: JsonPath }; // Using title to mimick json schema, but can use namespace type OneOfPath = { oneOf: JsonPath[] }; type Widget = { type: string // Some well known type (e.g., base64file, chat etc.) [key: string]: JsonPath | NameSpacedPath | OneOfPath; }; ``` #### File Upload Widget\u200b Allows creation of a file upload input in the UI playground for files that are uploaded as base64 encoded strings. Here\'s the full [example]( Snippet: ```python try: from pydantic.v1 import Field except ImportError: from pydantic import Field from langserve import CustomUserType # ATTENTION: Inherit from CustomUserType instead of BaseModel otherwise # the server will decode it into a dict instead of a pydantic model. class FileProcessingRequest(CustomUserType): """"""Request including a base64 encoded file."""""" # The extra field is used to specify a widget for the playground UI. file: str = Field(..., extra={""widget"": {""type"": ""base64file""}}) num_chars: int = 100 ``` Example widget: ![]( - [Overview](#overview) - [Features](#features)- [Limitations](#limitations) - [Hosted LangServe](#hosted-langserve) - [Security](#security) - [Installation](#installation) - [LangChain CLI ](#langchain-cli-) - [Examples](#examples)- [Server](#server) - [Docs](#docs) - [Client](#client) - [Endpoints](#endpoints) - [Playground](#playground)- [Widgets](#widgets) - [Sharing](#sharing) - [Legacy Chains](#legacy-chains) - [Deployment](#deployment)- [Deploy to GCP](#deploy-to-gcp) - [Pydantic](#pydantic) - [Advanced](#advanced) - [Handling Authentication](#handling-authentication)- [Files](#files) - [Custom Input and Output Types](#custom-input-and-output-types) - [Custom User Types](#custom-user-types) - [Playground Widgets](#playground-widgets)', 'langchain.schema.callbacks.manager.handle_event LangChain 0.0.337 API Experimental Python Docs Toggle Menu PrevUp Next LangChain 0.0.337 langchain.schema.callbacks.manager.handle_event langchain.schema.callbacks.manager.handle_event langchain.schema.callbacks.manager.handle_event(handlers: List[BaseCallbackHandler], event_name: str, ignore_condition_name: Optional[str], *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) None[source] Generic event handler for CallbackManager.

Show this page source', 'Quickstart | Quickstart In this quickstart we\'ll show you how to: - Get setup with LangChain, LangSmith and LangServe - Use the most basic and common components of LangChain: prompt templates, models, and output parsers - Use LangChain Expression Language, the protocol that LangChain is built on and which facilitates component chaining - Build a simple application with LangChain - Trace your application with LangSmith - Serve your application with LangServe That\'s a fair amount to cover! Let\'s dive in. ## Setup ### Installation To install LangChain run: Pip ```bash pip install langchain ``` Conda ```bash conda install langchain -c conda-forge ``` For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/get_started/installation). ### Environment Using LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, APIs, etc. For this example, we\'ll use OpenAI\'s model APIs. First we\'ll need to install their Python package: ```bash pip install openai ``` Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading [here]( Once we have a key we\'ll want to set it as an environment variable by running: ```bash export OPENAI_API_KEY=""..."" ``` If you\'d prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the `openai_api_key` named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=""..."") ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```shell export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=""true"" export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=... ``` ### LangServe LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain chains as a REST API. You do not need to use LangServe to use LangChain, but in this guide we\'ll show how you can deploy your app with LangServe. Install with: ```bash pip install ""langserve[all]"" ``` ## Building with LangChain LangChain provides many modules that can be used to build language model applications. Modules can be used as standalones in simple applications and they can be composed for more complex use cases. Composition is powered by **LangChain Expression Language** (LCEL), which defines a unified `Runnable` interface that many modules implement, making it possible to seamlessly chain components. The simplest and most common chain contains three things: - LLM/Chat Model: The language model is the core reasoning engine here. In order to work with LangChain, you need to understand the different types of language models and how to work with them. - Prompt Template: This provides instructions to the language model. This controls what the language model outputs, so understanding how to construct prompts and different prompting strategies is crucial. - Output Parser: These translate the raw response from the language model to a more workable format, making it easy to use the output downstream. In this guide we\'ll cover those three components individually, and then go over how to combine them. Understanding these concepts will set you up well for being able to use and customize LangChain applications. Most LangChain applications allow you to configure the model and/or the prompt, so knowing how to take advantage of this will be a big enabler. ### LLM / Chat Model There are two types of language models: - `LLM`: underlying model takes a string as input and returns a string - `ChatModel`: underlying model takes a list of messages as input and returns a message Strings are simple, but what exactly are messages? The base message interface is defined by `BaseMessage`, which has two required attributes: - `content`: The content of the message. Usually a string. - `role`: The entity from which the `BaseMessage` is coming. LangChain provides several objects to easily distinguish between different roles: - `HumanMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from a human/user. - `AIMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from an AI/assistant. - `SystemMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from the system. - `FunctionMessage` / `ToolMessage`: A `BaseMessage` containing the output of a function or tool call. If none of those roles sound right, there is also a `ChatMessage` class where you can specify the role manually. LangChain provides a common interface that\'s shared by both `LLM`s and `ChatModel`s. However it\'s useful to understand the difference in order to most effectively construct prompts for a given language model. The simplest way to call an `LLM` or `ChatModel` is using `.invoke()`, the universal synchronous call method for all LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) objects: - `LLM.invoke`: Takes in a string, returns a string. - `ChatModel.invoke`: Takes in a list of `BaseMessage`, returns a `BaseMessage`. The input types for these methods are actually more general than this, but for simplicity here we can assume LLMs only take strings and Chat models only takes lists of messages. Check out the ""Go deeper"" section below to learn more about model invocation. Let\'s see how to work with these different types of models and these different types of inputs. First, let\'s import an LLM and a ChatModel. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = OpenAI() chat_model = ChatOpenAI() ``` `LLM` and `ChatModel` objects are effectively configuration objects. You can initialize them with parameters like `temperature` and others, and pass them around. ```python from langchain.schema import HumanMessage text = ""What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"" messages = [HumanMessage(content=text)] llm.invoke(text) # >> Feetful of Fun chat_model.invoke(messages) # >> AIMessage(content=""Socks O\'Color"") ``` Go deeper `LLM.invoke` and `ChatModel.invoke` actually both support as input any of `Union[str, List[BaseMessage], PromptValue]`. `PromptValue` is an object that defines it\'s own custom logic for returning it\'s inputs either as a string or as messages. `LLM`s have logic for coercing any of these into a string, and `ChatModel`s have logic for coercing any of these to messages. The fact that `LLM` and `ChatModel` accept the same inputs means that you can directly swap them for one another in most chains without breaking anything, though it\'s of course important to think about how inputs are being coerced and how that may affect model performance. To dive deeper on models head to the [Language models](/docs/modules/model_io/models) section. ### Prompt templates Most LLM applications do not pass user input directly into an LLM. Usually they will add the user input to a larger piece of text, called a prompt template, that provides additional context on the specific task at hand. In the previous example, the text we passed to the model contained instructions to generate a company name. For our application, it would be great if the user only had to provide the description of a company/product, without having to worry about giving the model instructions. PromptTemplates help with exactly this! They bundle up all the logic for going from user input into a fully formatted prompt. This can start off very simple - for example, a prompt to produce the above string would just be: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"") prompt.format(product=""colorful socks"") ``` ```python What is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks? ``` However, the advantages of using these over raw string formatting are several. You can ""partial"" out variables - e.g. you can format only some of the variables at a time. You can compose them together, easily combining different templates into a single prompt. For explanations of these functionalities, see the [section on prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts) for more detail. `PromptTemplate`s can also be used to produce a list of messages. In this case, the prompt not only contains information about the content, but also each message (its role, its position in the list, etc.). Here, what happens most often is a `ChatPromptTemplate` is a list of `ChatMessageTemplates`. Each `ChatMessageTemplate` contains instructions for how to format that `ChatMessage` - its role, and then also its content. Let\'s take a look at this below: ```python from langchain.prompts.chat import ChatPromptTemplate template = ""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}."" human_template = ""{text}"" chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", template), (""human"", human_template), ]) chat_prompt.format_messages(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."") ``` ```pycon [ SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."", additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming."") ] ``` ChatPromptTemplates can also be constructed in other ways - see the [section on prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts) for more detail. ### Output parsers `OutputParsers` convert the raw output of a language model into a format that can be used downstream. There are few main types of `OutputParser`s, including: - Convert text from `LLM` into structured information (e.g. JSON) - Convert a `ChatMessage` into just a string - Convert the extra information returned from a call besides the message (like OpenAI function invocation) into a string. For full information on this, see the [section on output parsers](/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers). In this getting started guide, we will write our own output parser - one that converts a comma separated list into a list. ```python from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""""" def parse(self, text: str): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call."""""" return text.strip().split("", "") CommaSeparatedListOutputParser().parse(""hi, bye"") # >> [\'hi\', \'bye\'] ``` ### Composing with LCEL We can now combine all these into one chain. This chain will take input variables, pass those to a prompt template to create a prompt, pass the prompt to a language model, and then pass the output through an (optional) output parser. This is a convenient way to bundle up a modular piece of logic. Let\'s see it in action! ```python from typing import List from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser[List[str]]): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""""" def parse(self, text: str) -> List[str]: """"""Parse the output of an LLM call."""""" return text.strip().split("", "") template = """"""You are a helpful assistant who generates comma separated lists. A user will pass in a category, and you should generate 5 objects in that category in a comma separated list. ONLY return a comma separated list, and nothing more."""""" human_template = ""{text}"" chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", template), (""human"", human_template), ]) chain = chat_prompt | ChatOpenAI() | CommaSeparatedListOutputParser() chain.invoke({""text"": ""colors""}) # >> [\'red\', \'blue\', \'green\', \'yellow\', \'orange\'] ``` Note that we are using the `|` syntax to join these components together. This `|` syntax is powered by the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and relies on the universal `Runnable` interface that all of these objects implement. To learn more about LCEL, read the documentation [here](/docs/expression_language). ## Tracing with LangSmith Assuming we\'ve set our environment variables as shown in the beginning, all of the model and chain calls we\'ve been making will have been automatically logged to LangSmith. Once there, we can use LangSmith to debug and annotate our application traces, then turn them into datasets for evaluating future iterations of the application. Check out what the trace for the above chain would look like: [ For more on LangSmith [head here](/docs/langsmith/). ## Serving with LangServe Now that we\'ve built an application, we need to serve it. That\'s where LangServe comes in. LangServe helps developers deploy LCEL chains as a REST API. The library is integrated with FastAPI and uses pydantic for data validation. ### Server To create a server for our application we\'ll make a `serve.py` file with three things: 1. The definition of our chain (same as above) 2. Our FastAPI app 3. A definition of a route from which to serve the chain, which is done with `langserve.add_routes` ```python #!/usr/bin/env python from typing import List from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser from langserve import add_routes # 1. Chain definition class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser[List[str]]): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""""" def parse(self, text: str) -> List[str]: """"""Parse the output of an LLM call."""""" return text.strip().split("", "") template = """"""You are a helpful assistant who generates comma separated lists. A user will pass in a category, and you should generate 5 objects in that category in a comma separated list. ONLY return a comma separated list, and nothing more."""""" human_template = ""{text}"" chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", template), (""human"", human_template), ]) category_chain = chat_prompt | ChatOpenAI() | CommaSeparatedListOutputParser() # 2. App definition app = FastAPI( title=""LangChain Server"", version=""1.0"", description=""A simple api server using Langchain\'s Runnable interfaces"", ) # 3. Adding chain route add_routes( app, category_chain, path=""/category_chain"", ) if __name__ == ""__main__"": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, host=""localhost"", port=8000) ``` And that\'s it! If we execute this file: ```bash python serve.py ``` we should see our chain being served at localhost:8000. ### Playground Every LangServe service comes with a simple built-in UI for configuring and invoking the application with streaming output and visibility into intermediate steps. Head to to try it out! ### Client Now let\'s set up a client for programmatically interacting with our service. We can easily do this with the `langserve.RemoteRunnable`. Using this, we can interact with the served chain as if it were running client-side. ```python from langserve import RemoteRunnable remote_chain = RemoteRunnable("" remote_chain.invoke({""text"": ""colors""}) # >> [\'red\', \'blue\', \'green\', \'yellow\', \'orange\'] ``` To learn more about the many other features of LangServe [head here](/docs/langserve). ## Next steps We\'ve touched on how to build an application with LangChain, how to trace it with LangSmith, and how to serve it with LangServe. There are a lot more features in all three of these than we can cover here.

It defines a simple chat bot in [chain.py](/docs/templates/chat_bot_feedback/chain.py) and custom evaluator that scores bot response effectiveness based on the subsequent user response. You can apply this run evaluator to your own chat bot by calling `with_config` on the chat bot before serving. You can also directly deploy your chat app using this template. [Chat bots]( are one of the most common interfaces for deploying LLMs. The quality of chat bots varies, making continuous development important. But users are wont to leave explicit feedback through mechanisms like thumbs-up or thumbs-down buttons. Furthermore, traditional analytics such as ""session length"" or ""conversation length"" often lack clarity. However, multi-turn conversations with a chat bot can provide a wealth of information, which we can transform into metrics for fine-tuning, evaluation, and product analytics. Taking [Chat Langchain]( as a case study, only about 0.04% of all queries receive explicit feedback. Yet, approximately 70% of the queries are follow-ups to previous questions. A significant portion of these follow-up queries continue useful information we can use to infer the quality of the previous AI response. This template helps solve this ""feedback scarcity"" problem. Below is an example invocation of this chat bot: []( When the user responds to this ([link]( the response evaluator is invoked, resulting in the following evaluationrun: []( As shown, the evaluator sees that the user is increasingly frustrated, indicating that the prior response was not effective ## LangSmith Feedback [LangSmith]( is a platform for building production-grade LLM applications. Beyond its debugging and offline evaluation features, LangSmith helps you capture both user and model-assisted feedback to refine your LLM application. This template uses an LLM to generate feedback for your application, which you can use to continuously improve your service. For more examples on collecting feedback using LangSmith, consult the [documentation]( ## Evaluator Implementation The user feedback is inferred by custom `RunEvaluator`. This evaluator is called using the `EvaluatorCallbackHandler`, which run it in a separate thread to avoid interfering with the chat bot\'s runtime. You can use this custom evaluator on any compatible chat bot by calling the following function on your LangChain object: ```python my_chain .with_config( callbacks=[ EvaluatorCallbackHandler( evaluators=[ ResponseEffectivenessEvaluator(evaluate_response_effectiveness) ] ) ], ) ``` The evaluator instructs an LLM, specifically `gpt-3.5-turbo`, to evaluate the AI\'s most recent chat message based on the user\'s followup response. It generates a score and accompanying reasoning that is converted to feedback in LangSmith, applied to the value provided as the `last_run_id`. The prompt used within the LLM [is available on the hub]( Feel free to customize it with things like additional app context (such as the goal of the app or the types of questions it should respond to) or ""symptoms"" you\'d like the LLM to focus on. This evaluator also utilizes OpenAI\'s function-calling API to ensure a more consistent, structured output for the grade. ## Environment Variables Ensure that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to use OpenAI models. Also, configure LangSmith by setting your `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`. ```bash export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=... export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=my-project # Set to the project you want to save to ``` ## Usage If deploying via `LangServe`, we recommend configuring the server to return callback events as well. This will ensure the backend traces are included in whatever traces you generate using the `RemoteRunnable`. ```python from chat_bot_feedback.chain import chain add_routes(app, chain, path=""/chat-bot-feedback"", include_callback_events=True) ``` With the server running, you can use the following code snippet to stream the chat bot responses for a 2 turn conversation. ```python from functools import partial from typing import Dict, Optional, Callable, List from langserve import RemoteRunnable from langchain.callbacks.manager import tracing_v2_enabled from langchain.schema import BaseMessage, AIMessage, HumanMessage # Update with the URL provided by your LangServe server chain = RemoteRunnable("" def stream_content( text: str, chat_history: Optional[List[BaseMessage]] = None, last_run_id: Optional[str] = None, on_chunk: Callable = None, ): results = [] with tracing_v2_enabled() as cb: for chunk in chain.stream( {""text"": text, ""chat_history"": chat_history, ""last_run_id"": last_run_id}, ): on_chunk(chunk) results.append(chunk) last_run_id = cb.latest_run.id if cb.latest_run else None return last_run_id, """".join(results) chat_history = [] text = ""Where are my keys?"" last_run_id, response_message = stream_content(text, on_chunk=partial(print, end="""")) print() chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=text), AIMessage(content=response_message)]) text = ""I CAN\'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE"" # The previous response will likely receive a low score, # as the user\'s frustration appears to be escalating. last_run_id, response_message = stream_content( text, chat_history=chat_history, last_run_id=str(last_run_id), on_chunk=partial(print, end=""""), ) print() chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=text), AIMessage(content=response_message)]) ``` This uses the `tracing_v2_enabled` callback manager to get the run ID of the call, which we provide in subsequent calls in the same chat thread, so the evaluator can assign feedback to the appropriate trace. ## Conclusion This template provides a simple chat bot definition you can directly deploy using LangServe. It defines a custom evaluator to log evaluation feedback for the bot without any explicit user ratings. This is an effective way to augment your analytics and to better select data points for fine-tuning and evaluation. - [LangSmith Feedback](#langsmith-feedback) - [Evaluator Implementation](#evaluator-implementation) - [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) - [Usage](#usage) - [Conclusion](#conclusion)']",LangServe helps deploy LangChain chains as a REST API.,"LangServe is an easy way to deploy any LangChain runnable, chain, or agent.

58,What's a string evaluator,"['Custom Trajectory Evaluator | Custom Trajectory Evaluator []( You can make your own custom trajectory evaluators by inheriting from the [AgentTrajectoryEvaluator]( class and overwriting the `_evaluate_agent_trajectory` (and `_aevaluate_agent_action`) method. In this example, you will make a simple trajectory evaluator that uses an LLM to determine if any actions were unnecessary. ```python from typing import Any, Optional, Sequence, Tuple from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.evaluation import AgentTrajectoryEvaluator from langchain.schema import AgentAction class StepNecessityEvaluator(AgentTrajectoryEvaluator): """"""Evaluate the perplexity of a predicted string."""""" def __init__(self) -> None: llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"", temperature=0.0) template = """"""Are any of the following steps unnecessary in answering {input}?

It returns the string \'decision\' as the \'value\', and includes the rest of the generated text as \'reasoning\' to let you audit the decision. You can call this evaluator to grade the intermediate steps of your agent\'s trajectory. ```python evaluator = StepNecessityEvaluator() evaluator.evaluate_agent_trajectory( prediction=""The answer is pi"", input=""What is today?"", agent_trajectory=[ ( AgentAction(tool=""ask"", tool_input=""What is today?"", log=""""), ""tomorrow\'s yesterday"", ), ( AgentAction(tool=""check_tv"", tool_input=""Watch tv for half hour"", log=""""), ""bzzz"", ), ], ) ``` ```text {\'score\': 1, \'value\': \'Y\', \'reasoning\': \'Y\'} ```', ""String Evaluators | String Evaluators A string evaluator is a component within LangChain designed to assess the performance of a language model by comparing its generated outputs (predictions) to a reference string or an input. This comparison is a crucial step in the evaluation of language models, providing a measure of the accuracy or quality of the generated text. In practice, string evaluators are typically used to evaluate a predicted string against a given input, such as a question or a prompt. Often, a reference label or context string is provided to define what a correct or ideal response would look like. These evaluators can be customized to tailor the evaluation process to fit your application's specific requirements. To create a custom string evaluator, inherit from the `StringEvaluator` class and implement the `_evaluate_strings` method. If you require asynchronous support, also implement the `_aevaluate_strings` method. Here's a summary of the key attributes and methods associated with a string evaluator: - `evaluation_name`: Specifies the name of the evaluation. - `requires_input`: Boolean attribute that indicates whether the evaluator requires an input string. If True, the evaluator will raise an error when the input isn't provided. If False, a warning will be logged if an input _is_ provided, indicating that it will not be considered in the evaluation. - `requires_reference`: Boolean attribute specifying whether the evaluator requires a reference label. If True, the evaluator will raise an error when the reference isn't provided. If False, a warning will be logged if a reference _is_ provided, indicating that it will not be considered in the evaluation. String evaluators also implement the following methods: - `aevaluate_strings`: Asynchronously evaluates the output of the Chain or Language Model, with support for optional input and label. - `evaluate_strings`: Synchronously evaluates the output of the Chain or Language Model, with support for optional input and label. The following sections provide detailed information on available string evaluator implementations as well as how to create a custom string evaluator.

It allows you to verify if an LLM or Chain\'s output complies with a defined set of criteria. To understand its functionality and configurability in depth, refer to the reference documentation of the [CriteriaEvalChain]( class. ### Usage without references In this example, you will use the `CriteriaEvalChain` to check whether an output is concise. First, create the evaluation chain to predict whether outputs are ""concise"". ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", criteria=""conciseness"") # This is equivalent to loading using the enum from langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorType evaluator = load_evaluator(EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'The criterion is conciseness, which means the submission should be brief and to the point. \\n\\nLooking at the submission, the answer to the question ""What\\\'s 2+2?"" is indeed ""four"". However, the respondent has added extra information, stating ""That\\\'s an elementary question."" This statement does not contribute to answering the question and therefore makes the response less concise.\\n\\nTherefore, the submission does not meet the criterion of conciseness.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` #### Output Format All string evaluators expose an [evaluate_strings]( (or async [aevaluate_strings]( method, which accepts: - input (str) The input to the agent. - prediction (str) The predicted response. The criteria evaluators return a dictionary with the following values: - score: Binary integer 0 to 1, where 1 would mean that the output is compliant with the criteria, and 0 otherwise - value: A ""Y"" or ""N"" corresponding to the score - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Using Reference Labels Some criteria (such as correctness) require reference labels to work correctly. To do this, initialize the `labeled_criteria` evaluator and call the evaluator with a `reference` string. ```python evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"") # We can even override the model\'s learned knowledge using ground truth labels eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( input=""What is the capital of the US?"", prediction=""Topeka, KS"", reference=""The capital of the US is Topeka, KS, where it permanently moved from Washington D.C. on May 16, 2023"", ) print(f\'With ground truth: {eval_result[""score""]}\') ``` ```text With ground truth: 1 ``` **Default Criteria** Most of the time, you\'ll want to define your own custom criteria (see below), but we also provide some common criteria you can load with a single string. Here\'s a list of pre-implemented criteria. Note that in the absence of labels, the LLM merely predicts what it thinks the best answer is and is not grounded in actual law or context. ```python from langchain.evaluation import Criteria # For a list of other default supported criteria, try calling `supported_default_criteria` list(Criteria) ``` ```text [, , , , , , , , , , ] ``` ## Custom Criteria To evaluate outputs against your own custom criteria, or to be more explicit the definition of any of the default criteria, pass in a dictionary of `""criterion_name"": ""criterion_description""` Note: it\'s recommended that you create a single evaluator per criterion. This way, separate feedback can be provided for each aspect. Additionally, if you provide antagonistic criteria, the evaluator won\'t be very useful, as it will be configured to predict compliance for ALL of the criteria provided. ```python custom_criterion = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric or mathematical information?"" } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criterion, ) query = ""Tell me a joke"" prediction = ""I ate some square pie but I don\'t know the square of pi."" eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(eval_result) # If you wanted to specify multiple criteria. Generally not recommended custom_criteria = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric information?"", ""mathematical"": ""Does the output contain mathematical information?"", ""grammatical"": ""Is the output grammatically correct?"", ""logical"": ""Is the output logical?"", } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criteria, ) eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(""Multi-criteria evaluation"") print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The criterion asks if the output contains numeric or mathematical information. The joke in the submission does contain mathematical information. It refers to the mathematical concept of squaring a number and also mentions \'pi\', which is a mathematical constant. Therefore, the submission does meet the criterion.\\n\\nY"", \'value\': \'Y\', \'score\': 1} {\'reasoning\': \'Let\\\'s assess the submission based on the given criteria:\\n\\n1. Numeric: The output does not contain any explicit numeric information. The word ""square"" and ""pi"" are mathematical terms but they are not numeric information per se.\\n\\n2.

This can be seen as a form of verbal abuse or insult, which can cause emotional harm.\\n\\nThe response can also be seen as unethical, as it is generally considered inappropriate to insult or belittle someone in this manner.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Configuring the LLM If you don\'t specify an eval LLM, the `load_evaluator` method will initialize a `gpt-4` LLM to power the grading chain. Below, use an anthropic model instead. ```python # %pip install ChatAnthropic # %env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", llm=llm, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Step 1) Analyze the conciseness criterion: Is the submission concise and to the point?\\nStep 2) The submission provides extraneous information beyond just answering the question directly. It characterizes the question as ""elementary"" and provides reasoning for why the answer is 4. This additional commentary makes the submission not fully concise.\\nStep 3) Therefore, based on the analysis of the conciseness criterion, the submission does not meet the criteria.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` # Configuring the Prompt If you want to completely customize the prompt, you can initialize the evaluator with a custom prompt template as follows. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate fstring = """"""Respond Y or N based on how well the following response follows the specified rubric. Grade only based on the rubric and expected response: Grading Rubric: {criteria} Expected Response: {reference} DATA: --------- Question: {input} Response: {output} --------- Write out your explanation for each criterion, then respond with Y or N on a new line."""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(fstring) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"", prompt=prompt) ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", reference=""It\'s 17 now."", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Correctness: No, the response is not correct. The expected response was ""It\\\'s 17 now."" but the response given was ""What\\\'s 2+2? That\\\'s an elementary question. The answer you\\\'re looking for is that two and two is four.""\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Conclusion In these examples, you used the `CriteriaEvalChain` to evaluate model outputs against custom criteria, including a custom rubric and constitutional principles. Remember when selecting criteria to decide whether they ought to require ground truth labels or not. Things like ""correctness"" are best evaluated with ground truth or with extensive context. Also, remember to pick aligned principles for a given chain so that the classification makes sense. - [Usage without references](#usage-without-references) - [Using Reference Labels](#using-reference-labels) - [Custom Criteria](#custom-criteria) - [Using Constitutional Principles](#using-constitutional-principles) - [Configuring the LLM](#configuring-the-llm) - [Conclusion](#conclusion)', ""Comparison Evaluators | Comparison Evaluators Comparison evaluators in LangChain help measure two different chains or LLM outputs. These evaluators are helpful for comparative analyses, such as A/B testing between two language models, or comparing different versions of the same model. They can also be useful for things like generating preference scores for ai-assisted reinforcement learning. These evaluators inherit from the `PairwiseStringEvaluator` class, providing a comparison interface for two strings - typically, the outputs from two different prompts or models, or two versions of the same model. In essence, a comparison evaluator performs an evaluation on a pair of strings and returns a dictionary containing the evaluation score and other relevant details. To create a custom comparison evaluator, inherit from the `PairwiseStringEvaluator` class and overwrite the `_evaluate_string_pairs` method. If you require asynchronous evaluation, also overwrite the `_aevaluate_string_pairs` method. Here's a summary of the key methods and properties of a comparison evaluator: - `evaluate_string_pairs`: Evaluate the output string pairs. This function should be overwritten when creating custom evaluators. - `aevaluate_string_pairs`: Asynchronously evaluate the output string pairs. This function should be overwritten for asynchronous evaluation. - `requires_input`: This property indicates whether this evaluator requires an input string. - `requires_reference`: This property specifies whether this evaluator requires a reference label.

[Sign up here]( to get on the waitlist. ## Overview `LangServe` helps developers deploy `LangChain` [runnables and chains]( as a REST API. This library is integrated with [FastAPI]( and uses [pydantic]( for data validation. In addition, it provides a client that can be used to call into runnables deployed on a server. A javascript client is available in [LangChainJS]( ## Features - Input and Output schemas automatically inferred from your LangChain object, and enforced on every API call, with rich error messages - API docs page with JSONSchema and Swagger (insert example link) - Efficient `/invoke`, `/batch` and `/stream` endpoints with support for many concurrent requests on a single server - `/stream_log` endpoint for streaming all (or some) intermediate steps from your chain/agent - Playground page at `/playground` with streaming output and intermediate steps - Built-in (optional) tracing to [LangSmith]( just add your API key (see [Instructions]( - All built with battle-tested open-source Python libraries like FastAPI, Pydantic, uvloop and asyncio. - Use the client SDK to call a LangServe server as if it was a Runnable running locally (or call the HTTP API directly) - [LangServe Hub]( ### Limitations - Client callbacks are not yet supported for events that originate on the server - OpenAPI docs will not be generated when using Pydantic V2. Fast API does not support [mixing pydantic v1 and v2 namespaces]( See section below for more details. ## Hosted LangServe We will be releasing a hosted version of LangServe for one-click deployments of LangChain applications. [Sign up here]( to get on the waitlist. ## Security - Vulnerability in Versions 0.0.13 - 0.0.15 -- playground endpoint allows accessing arbitrary files on server. [Resolved in 0.0.16]( ## Installation For both client and server: ```bash pip install ""langserve[all]"" ``` or `pip install ""langserve[client]""` for client code, and `pip install ""langserve[server]""` for server code. ## LangChain CLI Use the `LangChain` CLI to bootstrap a `LangServe` project quickly. To use the langchain CLI make sure that you have a recent version of `langchain-cli` installed. You can install it with `pip install -U langchain-cli`. ```sh langchain app new ../path/to/directory ``` ## Examples Get your LangServe instance started quickly with [LangChain Templates]( For more examples, see the templates [index]( or the [examples]( directory. ### Server Here\'s a server that deploys an OpenAI chat model, an Anthropic chat model, and a chain that uses the Anthropic model to tell a joke about a topic. ```python #!/usr/bin/env python from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI from langserve import add_routes app = FastAPI( title=""LangChain Server"", version=""1.0"", description=""A simple api server using Langchain\'s Runnable interfaces"", ) add_routes( app, ChatOpenAI(), path=""/openai"", ) add_routes( app, ChatAnthropic(), path=""/anthropic"", ) model = ChatAnthropic() prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""tell me a joke about {topic}"") add_routes( app, prompt | model, path=""/joke"", ) if __name__ == ""__main__"": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, host=""localhost"", port=8000) ``` ### Docs If you\'ve deployed the server above, you can view the generated OpenAPI docs using: If using pydantic v2, docs will not be generated for invoke/batch/stream/stream_log. See [Pydantic](#pydantic) section below for more details. ```sh curl localhost:8000/docs ``` make sure to **add** the `/docs` suffix. Index page `/` is not defined by **design**, so `curl localhost:8000` or visiting the URL will return a 404. If you want content at `/` define an endpoint `@app.get(""/"")`. ### Client Python SDK ```python from langchain.schema import SystemMessage, HumanMessage from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableMap from langserve import RemoteRunnable openai = RemoteRunnable("" anthropic = RemoteRunnable("" joke_chain = RemoteRunnable("" joke_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""parrots""}) # or async await joke_chain.ainvoke({""topic"": ""parrots""}) prompt = [ SystemMessage(content=\'Act like either a cat or a parrot.\'), HumanMessage(content=\'Hello!\') ] # Supports astream async for msg in anthropic.astream(prompt): print(msg, end="""", flush=True) prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [(""system"", ""Tell me a long story about {topic}"")] ) # Can define custom chains chain = prompt | RunnableMap({ ""openai"": openai, ""anthropic"": anthropic, }) chain.batch([{ ""topic"": ""parrots"" }, { ""topic"": ""cats"" }]) ``` In TypeScript (requires LangChain.js version 0.0.166 or later): ```typescript import { RemoteRunnable } from ""langchain/runnables/remote""; const chain = new RemoteRunnable({ url: ` }); const result = await chain.invoke({ topic: ""cats"", }); ``` Python using `requests`: ```python import requests response = requests.post( "" json={\'input\': {\'topic\': \'cats\'}} ) response.json() ``` You can also use `curl`: ```sh curl --location --request POST \' \\ --header \'Content-Type: application/json\' \\ --data-raw \'{ ""input"": { ""topic"": ""cats"" } }\' ``` ## Endpoints The following code: ```python ... add_routes( app, runnable, path=""/my_runnable"", ) ``` adds of these endpoints to the server: - `POST /my_runnable/invoke` - invoke the runnable on a single input - `POST /my_runnable/batch` - invoke the runnable on a batch of inputs - `POST /my_runnable/stream` - invoke on a single input and stream the output - `POST /my_runnable/stream_log` - invoke on a single input and stream the output, including output of intermediate steps as it\'s generated - `GET /my_runnable/input_schema` - json schema for input to the runnable - `GET /my_runnable/output_schema` - json schema for output of the runnable - `GET /my_runnable/config_schema` - json schema for config of the runnable These endpoints match the [LangChain Expression Language interface]( -- please reference this documentation for more details. ## Playground You can find a playground page for your runnable at `/my_runnable/playground`. This exposes a simple UI to [configure]( and invoke your runnable with streaming output and intermediate steps. ![]( ### Widgets The playground supports [widgets](#playground-widgets) and can be used to test your runnable with different inputs. In addition, for configurable runnables, the playground will allow you to configure the runnable and share a link with the configuration: ### Sharing ![]( ## Legacy Chains LangServe works with both Runnables (constructed via [LangChain Expression Language]( and legacy chains (inheriting from `Chain`). However, some of the input schemas for legacy chains may be incomplete/incorrect, leading to errors. This can be fixed by updating the `input_schema` property of those chains in LangChain. If you encounter any errors, please open an issue on THIS repo, and we will work to address it. ## Deployment ### Deploy to GCP You can deploy to GCP Cloud Run using the following command: ```text gcloud run deploy [your-service-name] --source . --port 8001 --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1 --set-env-vars=OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key ``` ## Pydantic LangServe provides support for Pydantic 2 with some limitations. 1. OpenAPI docs will not be generated for invoke/batch/stream/stream_log when using Pydantic V2. Fast API does not support [mixing pydantic v1 and v2 namespaces] . 2. LangChain uses the v1 namespace in Pydantic v2. Please read the [following guidelines to ensure compatibility with LangChain]( Except for these limitations, we expect the API endpoints, the playground and any other features to work as expected. ## Advanced ## Handling Authentication If you need to add authentication to your server, please reference FastAPI\'s [security documentation]( and [middleware documentation]( ### Files LLM applications often deal with files. There are different architectures that can be made to implement file processing; at a high level: 1. The file may be uploaded to the server via a dedicated endpoint and processed using a separate endpoint 2. The file may be uploaded by either value (bytes of file) or reference (e.g., s3 url to file content) 3. The processing endpoint may be blocking or non-blocking 4. If significant processing is required, the processing may be offloaded to a dedicated process pool You should determine what is the appropriate architecture for your application. Currently, to upload files by value to a runnable, use base64 encoding for the file (`multipart/form-data` is not supported yet). Here\'s an [example]( that shows how to use base64 encoding to send a file to a remote runnable. Remember, you can always upload files by reference (e.g., s3 url) or upload them as multipart/form-data to a dedicated endpoint. ### Custom Input and Output Types Input and Output types are defined on all runnables. You can access them via the `input_schema` and `output_schema` properties. `LangServe` uses these types for validation and documentation. If you want to override the default inferred types, you can use the `with_types` method. Here\'s a toy example to illustrate the idea: ```python from typing import Any from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda app = FastAPI() def func(x: Any) -> int: """"""Mistyped function that should accept an int but accepts anything."""""" return x + 1 runnable = RunnableLambda(func).with_types( input_schema=int, ) add_routes(app, runnable) ``` ### Custom User Types Inherit from `CustomUserType` if you want the data to de-serialize into a pydantic model rather than the equivalent dict representation. At the moment, this type only works _server_ side and is used to specify desired _decoding_ behavior. If inheriting from this type the server will keep the decoded type as a pydantic model instead of converting it into a dict. ```python from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda from langserve import add_routes from langserve.schema import CustomUserType app = FastAPI() class Foo(CustomUserType): bar: int def func(foo: Foo) -> int: """"""Sample function that expects a Foo type which is a pydantic model"""""" assert isinstance(foo, Foo) return foo.bar # Note that the input and output type are automatically inferred! # You do not need to specify them. # runnable = RunnableLambda(func).with_types( # <-- Not needed in this case # input_schema=Foo, # output_schema=int, # add_routes(app, RunnableLambda(func), path=""/foo"") ``` ### Playground Widgets\u200b The playground allows you to define custom widgets for your runnable from the backend. - A widget is specified at the field level and shipped as part of the JSON schema of the input type - A widget must contain a key called `type` with the value being one of a well known list of widgets - Other widget keys will be associated with values that describe paths in a JSON object General schema: ```typescript type JsonPath = number | string | (number | string)[]; type NameSpacedPath = { title: string; path: JsonPath }; // Using title to mimick json schema, but can use namespace type OneOfPath = { oneOf: JsonPath[] }; type Widget = { type: string // Some well known type (e.g., base64file, chat etc.) [key: string]: JsonPath | NameSpacedPath | OneOfPath; }; ``` #### File Upload Widget\u200b Allows creation of a file upload input in the UI playground for files that are uploaded as base64 encoded strings. Here\'s the full [example]( Snippet: ```python try: from pydantic.v1 import Field except ImportError: from pydantic import Field from langserve import CustomUserType # ATTENTION: Inherit from CustomUserType instead of BaseModel otherwise # the server will decode it into a dict instead of a pydantic model. class FileProcessingRequest(CustomUserType): """"""Request including a base64 encoded file."""""" # The extra field is used to specify a widget for the playground UI. file: str = Field(..., extra={""widget"": {""type"": ""base64file""}}) num_chars: int = 100 ``` Example widget: ![]( - [Overview](#overview) - [Features](#features)- [Limitations](#limitations) - [Hosted LangServe](#hosted-langserve) - [Security](#security) - [Installation](#installation) - [LangChain CLI ](#langchain-cli-) - [Examples](#examples)- [Server](#server) - [Docs](#docs) - [Client](#client) - [Endpoints](#endpoints) - [Playground](#playground)- [Widgets](#widgets) - [Sharing](#sharing) - [Legacy Chains](#legacy-chains) - [Deployment](#deployment)- [Deploy to GCP](#deploy-to-gcp) - [Pydantic](#pydantic) - [Advanced](#advanced) - [Handling Authentication](#handling-authentication)- [Files](#files) - [Custom Input and Output Types](#custom-input-and-output-types) - [Custom User Types](#custom-user-types) - [Playground Widgets](#playground-widgets)', 'Marqo | Marqo This page covers how to use the Marqo ecosystem within LangChain. ### What is Marqo? Marqo is a tensor search engine that uses embeddings stored in in-memory HNSW indexes to achieve cutting edge search speeds. Marqo can scale to hundred-million document indexes with horizontal index sharding and allows for async and non-blocking data upload and search. Marqo uses the latest machine learning models from PyTorch, Huggingface, OpenAI and more. You can start with a pre-configured model or bring your own. The built in ONNX support and conversion allows for faster inference and higher throughput on both CPU and GPU. Because Marqo include its own inference your documents can have a mix of text and images, you can bring Marqo indexes with data from your other systems into the langchain ecosystem without having to worry about your embeddings being compatible. Deployment of Marqo is flexible, you can get started yourself with our docker image or [contact us about our managed cloud offering!]( To run Marqo locally with our docker image, [see our getting started.]( ## Installation and Setup - Install the Python SDK with `pip install marqo` ## Wrappers ### VectorStore There exists a wrapper around Marqo indexes, allowing you to use them within the vectorstore framework. Marqo lets you select from a range of models for generating embeddings and exposes some preprocessing configurations. The Marqo vectorstore can also work with existing multimodel indexes where your documents have a mix of images and text, for more information refer to [our documentation]( Note that instaniating the Marqo vectorstore with an existing multimodal index will disable the ability to add any new documents to it via the langchain vectorstore `add_texts` method.

Once you have it, set it as an environment variable by running: ```bash export LLMONITOR_APP_ID=""..."" ``` If you\'d prefer not to set an environment variable, you can pass the key directly when initializing the callback handler: ```python from langchain.callbacks import LLMonitorCallbackHandler handler = LLMonitorCallbackHandler(app_id=""..."") ``` ## Usage with LLM/Chat models ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.callbacks import LLMonitorCallbackHandler handler = LLMonitorCallbackHandler() llm = OpenAI( callbacks=[handler], ) chat = ChatOpenAI(callbacks=[handler]) llm(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ## Usage with chains and agents Make sure to pass the callback handler to the `run` method so that all related chains and llm calls are correctly tracked. It is also recommended to pass `agent_name` in the metadata to be able to distinguish between agents in the dashboard. Example: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import SystemMessage, HumanMessage from langchain.agents import OpenAIFunctionsAgent, AgentExecutor, tool from langchain.callbacks import LLMonitorCallbackHandler llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) handler = LLMonitorCallbackHandler() @tool def get_word_length(word: str) -> int: """"""Returns the length of a word."""""" return len(word) tools = [get_word_length] prompt = OpenAIFunctionsAgent.create_prompt( system_message=SystemMessage( content=""You are very powerful assistant, but bad at calculating lengths of words."" ) ) agent = OpenAIFunctionsAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt, verbose=True) agent_executor = AgentExecutor( agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True, metadata={""agent_name"": ""WordCount""} # <- recommended, assign a custom name ) agent_executor.run(""how many letters in the word educa?"", callbacks=[handler]) ``` Another example: ```python from langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent, AgentType from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.callbacks import LLMonitorCallbackHandler handler = LLMonitorCallbackHandler() llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm) agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, metadata={ ""agent_name"": ""GirlfriendAgeFinder"" }) # <- recommended, assign a custom name agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?

In an API call, you can describe functions and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. The goal of the OpenAI Function APIs is to more reliably return valid and useful function calls than a generic text completion or chat API. The OpenAI Functions Agent is designed to work with these models. Install `openai`, `google-search-results` packages which are required as the LangChain packages call them internally. ```bash pip install openai google-search-results ``` ## Initialize tools We will first create some tools we can use ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent from langchain.chains import LLMMathChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper, SQLDatabase from langchain_experimental.sql import SQLDatabaseChain ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"") search = SerpAPIWrapper() llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain.from_llm(llm=llm, verbose=True) db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(""sqlite:///../../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db"") db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True) tools = [ Tool( name=""Search"", func=search.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events.

To start, we will set up the retriever we want to use, and then turn it into a retriever tool. Next, we will use the high level constructor for this type of agent. Finally, we will walk through how to construct a conversational retrieval agent from components. ## The Retriever To start, we need a retriever to use! The code here is mostly just example code. Feel free to use your own retriever and skip to the section on creating a retriever tool. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader loader = TextLoader(""../../../../../docs/docs/modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() db = FAISS.from_documents(texts, embeddings) ``` ```python retriever = db.as_retriever() ``` ## Retriever Tool Now we need to create a tool for our retriever. The main things we need to pass in are a name for the retriever as well as a description. These will both be used by the language model, so they should be informative. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool ``` ```python tool = create_retriever_tool( retriever, ""search_state_of_union"", ""Searches and returns documents regarding the state-of-the-union."", ) tools = [tool] ``` ## Agent Constructor Here, we will use the high level `create_conversational_retrieval_agent` API to construct the agent. Notice that beside the list of tools, the only thing we need to pass in is a language model to use. Under the hood, this agent is using the OpenAIFunctionsAgent, so we need to use an ChatOpenAI model. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_conversational_retrieval_agent ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python agent_executor = create_conversational_retrieval_agent(llm, tools, verbose=True) ``` We can now try it out! ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""hi, im bob""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Let\'s take a look so we can understand how to modify going forward. There are a few components: - The memory - The prompt template - The agent - The agent executor ```python # This is needed for both the memory and the prompt memory_key = ""history"" ``` ### The Memory In this example, we want the agent to remember not only previous conversations, but also previous intermediate steps. For that, we can use `AgentTokenBufferMemory`. Note that if you want to change whether the agent remembers intermediate steps, or how the long the buffer is, or anything like that you should change this part. ```python from langchain.agents.openai_functions_agent.agent_token_buffer_memory import ( AgentTokenBufferMemory, ) memory = AgentTokenBufferMemory(memory_key=memory_key, llm=llm) ``` ## The Prompt Template For the prompt template, we will use the `OpenAIFunctionsAgent` default way of creating one, but pass in a system prompt and a placeholder for memory. ```python from langchain.agents.openai_functions_agent.base import OpenAIFunctionsAgent from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder from langchain.schema.messages import SystemMessage ``` ```python system_message = SystemMessage( content=( ""Do your best to answer the questions. "" ""Feel free to use any tools available to look up "" ""relevant information, only if necessary"" ) ) ``` ```python prompt = OpenAIFunctionsAgent.create_prompt( system_message=system_message, extra_prompt_messages=[MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=memory_key)], ) ``` ## The Agent We will use the OpenAIFunctionsAgent ```python agent = OpenAIFunctionsAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt) ``` ## The Agent Executor Importantly, we pass in `return_intermediate_steps=True` since we are recording that with our memory object ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor( agent=agent, tools=tools, memory=memory, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True, ) ``` ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""hi, im bob""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

62,What are some ways of doing retrieval augmented generation?,"['Remembrall | Remembrall This page covers how to use the [Remembrall]( ecosystem within LangChain. ## What is Remembrall? Remembrall gives your language model long-term memory, retrieval augmented generation, and complete observability with just a few lines of code. ![Remembrall Dashboard](/assets/images/RemembrallDashboard-36b4f535ae0718f2f5923084caf111de.png) It works as a light-weight proxy on top of your OpenAI calls and simply augments the context of the chat calls at runtime with relevant facts that have been collected. ## Setup To get started, [sign in with Github on the Remembrall platform]( and copy your [API key from the settings page]( Any request that you send with the modified `openai_api_base` (see below) and Remembrall API key will automatically be tracked in the Remembrall dashboard. You **never** have to share your OpenAI key with our platform and this information is **never** stored by the Remembrall systems. ### Enable Long Term Memory In addition to setting the `openai_api_base` and Remembrall API key via `x-gp-api-key`, you should specify a UID to maintain memory for. This will usually be a unique user identifier (like email). ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI chat_model = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_base="" model_kwargs={ ""headers"":{ ""x-gp-api-key"": ""remembrall-api-key-here"", ""x-gp-remember"": ""user@email.com"", } }) chat_model.predict(""My favorite color is blue."") import time; time.sleep(5) # wait for system to save fact via auto save print(chat_model.predict(""What is my favorite color?"")) ``` ### Enable Retrieval Augmented Generation First, create a document context in the [Remembrall dashboard]( Paste in the document texts or upload documents as PDFs to be processed. Save the Document Context ID and insert it as shown below. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI chat_model = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_base="" model_kwargs={ ""headers"":{ ""x-gp-api-key"": ""remembrall-api-key-here"", ""x-gp-context"": ""document-context-id-goes-here"", } }) print(chat_model.predict(""This is a question that can be answered with my document."")) ``` - [What is Remembrall?](#what-is-remembrall) - [Setup](#setup)- [Enable Long Term Memory](#enable-long-term-memory) - [Enable Retrieval Augmented Generation](#enable-retrieval-augmented-generation)', 'MultiQueryRetriever | MultiQueryRetriever Distance-based vector database retrieval embeds (represents) queries in high-dimensional space and finds similar embedded documents based on ""distance"". But, retrieval may produce different results with subtle changes in query wording or if the embeddings do not capture the semantics of the data well. Prompt engineering / tuning is sometimes done to manually address these problems, but can be tedious. The `MultiQueryRetriever` automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents. By generating multiple perspectives on the same question, the `MultiQueryRetriever` might be able to overcome some of the limitations of the distance-based retrieval and get a richer set of results. ```python # Build a sample vectorDB from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma # Load blog post loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() # Split text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) # VectorDB embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=embedding) ``` #### Simple usage Specify the LLM to use for query generation, and the retriever will do the rest. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetriever question = ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) retriever_from_llm = MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm( retriever=vectordb.as_retriever(), llm=llm ) ``` ```python # Set logging for the queries import logging logging.basicConfig() logging.getLogger(""langchain.retrievers.multi_query"").setLevel(logging.INFO) ``` ```python unique_docs = retriever_from_llm.get_relevant_documents(query=question) len(unique_docs) ``` ```text INFO:langchain.retrievers.multi_query:Generated queries: [\'1.

RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer: ``` We\'ll use the [LCEL Runnable]( protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box ```python from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python for chunk in rag_chain.stream(""What is Task Decomposition?""): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step.

There are two main things we need to do to support this. 1. Add a messages placeholder to our chain which allows us to pass in historical messages 2. Add a chain that takes the latest user query and reformulates it in the context of the chat history into a standalone question that can be passed to our retriever. Let\'s start with 2. We can build a ""condense question"" chain that looks something like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder condense_q_system_prompt = """"""Given a chat history and the latest user question \\ which might reference the chat history, formulate a standalone question \\ which can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \\ just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."""""" condense_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", condense_q_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) condense_q_chain = condense_q_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""What is meant by large"", } ) ``` ```text \'What is the definition of ""large"" in the context of a language model?\' ``` ```python condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""How do transformers work"", } ) ``` ```text \'How do transformer models function?\' ``` And now we can build our full QA chain. Notice we add some routing functionality to only run the ""condense question chain"" when our chat history isn\'t empty. ```python qa_system_prompt = """"""You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \\ Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. \\ If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. \\ Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\ {context}"""""" qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", qa_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) def condense_question(input: dict): if input.get(""chat_history""): return condense_q_chain else: return input[""question""] rag_chain = ( RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=condense_question | retriever | format_docs) | qa_prompt | llm ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] question = ""What is Task Decomposition?"" ai_msg = rag_chain.invoke({""question"": question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=question), ai_msg]) second_question = ""What are common ways of doing it?"" rag_chain.invoke({""question"": second_question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'Common ways of task decomposition include:\\n\\n1. Using Chain of Thought (CoT): CoT is a prompting technique that instructs the model to ""think step by step"" and decompose complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It utilizes more test-time computation and sheds light on the model\\\'s thinking process.\\n\\n2. Prompting with LLM: Language Model (LLM) can be used to prompt the model with simple instructions like ""Steps for XYZ"" or ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"" This allows the model to generate a sequence of subtasks or thought steps.\\n\\n3. Task-specific instructions: For certain tasks, task-specific instructions can be provided to guide the model in decomposing the task. For example, for writing a novel, the instruction ""Write a story outline"" can be given to break down the task into manageable steps.\\n\\n4. Human inputs: In some cases, human inputs can be used to assist in task decomposition. Humans can provide their expertise and knowledge to identify and break down complex tasks into smaller subtasks.\') ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( Here we\'ve gone over how to add chain logic for incorporating historical outputs.

They\'ve started by embedding the top 1200 Python libraries to enable code generation with up-to-date knowledge. They\'ve been kind enough to share their embeddings of the [LangChain docs]( and [API reference]( Let\'s take a look at how we can use these embeddings to power a docs retrieval system and ultimately a simple code generating chain! ```bash pip install langchain fleet-context openai pandas faiss-cpu # faiss-gpu for CUDA supported GPU ``` ```python from operator import itemgetter from typing import Any, Optional, Type import pandas as pd from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.retrievers import MultiVectorRetriever from langchain.schema import Document from langchain.schema.storage import BaseStore from langchain.schema.vectorstore import VectorStore from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS def load_fleet_retriever( df: pd.DataFrame, *, vectorstore_cls: Type[VectorStore] = FAISS, docstore: Optional[BaseStore] = None, **kwargs: Any, ): vectorstore = _populate_vectorstore(df, vectorstore_cls) if docstore is None: return vectorstore.as_retriever(**kwargs) else: _populate_docstore(df, docstore) return MultiVectorRetriever( vectorstore=vectorstore, docstore=docstore, id_key=""parent"", **kwargs ) def _populate_vectorstore( df: pd.DataFrame, vectorstore_cls: Type[VectorStore], ) -> VectorStore: if not hasattr(vectorstore_cls, ""from_embeddings""): raise ValueError( f""Incompatible vector store class {vectorstore_cls}.""

This means the vectors correspond to sections of pages in the LangChain docs, not entire pages. By default, when we spin up a retriever from these embeddings, we\'ll be retrieving these embedded chunks. We will be using Fleet Context\'s `download_embeddings()` to grab Langchain\'s documentation embeddings. You can view all supported libraries\' documentation at [ ```python from context import download_embeddings df = download_embeddings(""langchain"") vecstore_retriever = load_fleet_retriever(df) ``` ```python vecstore_retriever.get_relevant_documents(""How does the multi vector retriever work"") ``` ```text [Document(page_content=""# Vector store-backed retriever A vector store retriever is a retriever that uses a vector store to retrieve documents.

technique that enhances the knowledge of language models by incorporating external data sources. Here are some common methods for implementing RAG:

1. **Indexing**: Load and split the data into smaller chunks, then store and index these chunks using a vector store and embeddings.

2. **Retrieval**: Given a user query, retrieve relevant chunks from the index based on similarity measures like cosine similarity.

3. **Generation**: Use a language model to generate an answer by incorporating the retrieved chunks into the prompt.

4. **RAG Chain**: Combine the retrieval and generation steps into a chain where the retrieved context is fed into the language model to produce a response.

5. **Context Augmentation**: Enhance the model's context by dynamically fetching and incorporating relevant information from external data sources at runtime.

6. **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback mechanism where the model's output is used to refine the retrieval process, improving future responses.

These methods can be customized based on the specific requirements and data available for your application.","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a process that involves retrieving external data and using it in the generation step of language models. LangChain provides various building blocks for RAG applications. Here are some ways of doing retrieval augmented generation:

- Document loaders: LangChain offers over 100 document loaders to load documents from different sources, including private S3 buckets and public websites.
- Document transformers: These help in fetching relevant parts of documents by splitting or chunking large documents into smaller chunks.
- Text embedding models: LangChain integrates with over 25 different embedding providers and methods to create embeddings for documents, allowing efficient similarity-based retrieval.
- Vector stores: With the rise of embeddings, LangChain supports over 50 vector stores for efficient storage and searching of embeddings.
- Retrievers: LangChain supports various retrieval algorithms, including semantic search, parent document retriever, self-query retriever, ensemble retriever, and more, to retrieve the data from the database.

These components work together to enable retrieval augmented generation in LangChain. [0] [1]",0.99999999998,,,0.23869024451328552,0.21686746987951808

What is LangChain?\' ``` - [Using memory with LLM](#using-memory-with-llm) - [Using in a chain](#using-in-a-chain)', 'OpenLLM | OpenLLM This page demonstrates how to use [OpenLLM]( with LangChain. `OpenLLM` is an open platform for operating large language models (LLMs) in production. It enables developers to easily run inference with any open-source LLMs, deploy to the cloud or on-premises, and build powerful AI apps. ## Installation and Setup Install the OpenLLM package via PyPI: ```bash pip install openllm ``` ## LLM OpenLLM supports a wide range of open-source LLMs as well as serving users\' own fine-tuned LLMs. Use `openllm model` command to see all available models that are pre-optimized for OpenLLM. ## Wrappers There is a OpenLLM Wrapper which supports loading LLM in-process or accessing a remote OpenLLM server: ```python from langchain.llms import OpenLLM ``` ### Wrapper for OpenLLM server This wrapper supports connecting to an OpenLLM server via HTTP or gRPC. The OpenLLM server can run either locally or on the cloud. To try it out locally, start an OpenLLM server: ```bash openllm start flan-t5 ``` Wrapper usage: ```python from langchain.llms import OpenLLM llm = OpenLLM(server_url=\' llm(""What is the difference between a duck and a goose? And why there are so many Goose in Canada?"") ``` ### Wrapper for Local Inference You can also use the OpenLLM wrapper to load LLM in current Python process for running inference. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenLLM llm = OpenLLM(model_name=""dolly-v2"", model_id=\'databricks/dolly-v2-7b\') llm(""What is the difference between a duck and a goose? And why there are so many Goose in Canada?"") ``` ### Usage For a more detailed walkthrough of the OpenLLM Wrapper, see the [example notebook](/docs/integrations/llms/openllm) - [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) - [LLM](#llm) - [Wrappers](#wrappers)- [Wrapper for OpenLLM server](#wrapper-for-openllm-server) - [Wrapper for Local Inference](#wrapper-for-local-inference) - [Usage](#usage)']","InheritableHandler is a subclass of BaseHandler in LangChain, designed to be inherited by other handler classes.

Router chains are made up of two components: - The `RouterChain` itself (responsible for selecting the next chain to call) - `destination_chains`: chains that the router chain can route to In this example, we will focus on the different types of routing chains. We will show these routing chains used in a `MultiPromptChain` to create a question-answering chain that selects the prompt which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using that prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.chains.router import MultiPromptChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` ### [Legacy] LLMRouterChain This chain uses an LLM to determine how to route things. ```python prompt_infos = [ { ""name"": ""physics"", ""description"": ""Good for answering questions about physics"", ""prompt_template"": physics_template, }, { ""name"": ""math"", ""description"": ""Good for answering math questions"", ""prompt_template"": math_template, }, ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() ``` ```python destination_chains = {} for p_info in prompt_infos: name = p_info[""name""] prompt_template = p_info[""prompt_template""] prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=[""input""]) chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) destination_chains[name] = chain default_chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, output_key=""text"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains.router.llm_router import LLMRouterChain, RouterOutputParser from langchain.chains.router.multi_prompt_prompt import MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE ``` ```python destinations = [f""{p[\'name\']}: {p[\'description\']}"" for p in prompt_infos] destinations_str = ""\\n"".join(destinations) router_template = MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE.format(destinations=destinations_str) router_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=router_template, input_variables=[""input""], output_parser=RouterOutputParser(), ) router_chain = LLMRouterChain.from_llm(llm, router_prompt) ``` ```python chain = MultiPromptChain( router_chain=router_chain, destination_chains=destination_chains, default_chain=default_chain, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is black body radiation?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is black body radiation?\'} > Finished chain.

LCEL was designed from day 1 to **support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes**, from the simplest prompt + LLM chain to the most complex chains (we've seen folks successfully run LCEL chains with 100s of steps in production). To highlight a few of the reasons you might want to use LCEL: **Streaming support** When you build your chains with LCEL you get the best possible time-to-first-token (time elapsed until the first chunk of output comes out). For some chains this means eg. we stream tokens straight from an LLM to a streaming output parser, and you get back parsed, incremental chunks of output at the same rate as the LLM provider outputs the raw tokens. **Async support** Any chain built with LCEL can be called both with the synchronous API (eg. in your Jupyter notebook while prototyping) as well as with the asynchronous API (eg. in a [LangServe](/docs/langsmith) server). This enables using the same code for prototypes and in production, with great performance, and the ability to handle many concurrent requests in the same server. **Optimized parallel execution** Whenever your LCEL chains have steps that can be executed in parallel (eg if you fetch documents from multiple retrievers) we automatically do it, both in the sync and the async interfaces, for the smallest possible latency. **Retries and fallbacks** Configure retries and fallbacks for any part of your LCEL chain. This is a great way to make your chains more reliable at scale. We're currently working on adding streaming support for retries/fallbacks, so you can get the added reliability without any latency cost. **Access intermediate results** For more complex chains it's often very useful to access the results of intermediate steps even before the final output is produced. This can be used let end-users know something is happening, or even just to debug your chain. You can stream intermediate results, and it's available on every [LangServe](/docs/langserve) server. **Input and output schemas** Input and output schemas give every LCEL chain Pydantic and JSONSchema schemas inferred from the structure of your chain. This can be used for validation of inputs and outputs, and is an integral part of LangServe. **Seamless LangSmith tracing integration** As your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what exactly is happening at every step. With LCEL, **all** steps are automatically logged to [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith/) for maximum observability and debuggability. **Seamless LangServe deployment integration** Any chain created with LCEL can be easily deployed using [LangServe](/docs/langserve)."", 'Quickstart | Quickstart In this quickstart we\'ll show you how to: - Get setup with LangChain, LangSmith and LangServe - Use the most basic and common components of LangChain: prompt templates, models, and output parsers - Use LangChain Expression Language, the protocol that LangChain is built on and which facilitates component chaining - Build a simple application with LangChain - Trace your application with LangSmith - Serve your application with LangServe That\'s a fair amount to cover! Let\'s dive in. ## Setup ### Installation To install LangChain run: Pip ```bash pip install langchain ``` Conda ```bash conda install langchain -c conda-forge ``` For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/get_started/installation). ### Environment Using LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, APIs, etc. For this example, we\'ll use OpenAI\'s model APIs. First we\'ll need to install their Python package: ```bash pip install openai ``` Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading [here]( Once we have a key we\'ll want to set it as an environment variable by running: ```bash export OPENAI_API_KEY=""..."" ``` If you\'d prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the `openai_api_key` named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=""..."") ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```shell export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=""true"" export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=... ``` ### LangServe LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain chains as a REST API. You do not need to use LangServe to use LangChain, but in this guide we\'ll show how you can deploy your app with LangServe. Install with: ```bash pip install ""langserve[all]"" ``` ## Building with LangChain LangChain provides many modules that can be used to build language model applications. Modules can be used as standalones in simple applications and they can be composed for more complex use cases. Composition is powered by **LangChain Expression Language** (LCEL), which defines a unified `Runnable` interface that many modules implement, making it possible to seamlessly chain components. The simplest and most common chain contains three things: - LLM/Chat Model: The language model is the core reasoning engine here. In order to work with LangChain, you need to understand the different types of language models and how to work with them. - Prompt Template: This provides instructions to the language model. This controls what the language model outputs, so understanding how to construct prompts and different prompting strategies is crucial. - Output Parser: These translate the raw response from the language model to a more workable format, making it easy to use the output downstream. In this guide we\'ll cover those three components individually, and then go over how to combine them. Understanding these concepts will set you up well for being able to use and customize LangChain applications. Most LangChain applications allow you to configure the model and/or the prompt, so knowing how to take advantage of this will be a big enabler. ### LLM / Chat Model There are two types of language models: - `LLM`: underlying model takes a string as input and returns a string - `ChatModel`: underlying model takes a list of messages as input and returns a message Strings are simple, but what exactly are messages? The base message interface is defined by `BaseMessage`, which has two required attributes: - `content`: The content of the message. Usually a string. - `role`: The entity from which the `BaseMessage` is coming. LangChain provides several objects to easily distinguish between different roles: - `HumanMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from a human/user. - `AIMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from an AI/assistant. - `SystemMessage`: A `BaseMessage` coming from the system. - `FunctionMessage` / `ToolMessage`: A `BaseMessage` containing the output of a function or tool call. If none of those roles sound right, there is also a `ChatMessage` class where you can specify the role manually. LangChain provides a common interface that\'s shared by both `LLM`s and `ChatModel`s. However it\'s useful to understand the difference in order to most effectively construct prompts for a given language model. The simplest way to call an `LLM` or `ChatModel` is using `.invoke()`, the universal synchronous call method for all LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) objects: - `LLM.invoke`: Takes in a string, returns a string. - `ChatModel.invoke`: Takes in a list of `BaseMessage`, returns a `BaseMessage`. The input types for these methods are actually more general than this, but for simplicity here we can assume LLMs only take strings and Chat models only takes lists of messages. Check out the ""Go deeper"" section below to learn more about model invocation. Let\'s see how to work with these different types of models and these different types of inputs. First, let\'s import an LLM and a ChatModel. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = OpenAI() chat_model = ChatOpenAI() ``` `LLM` and `ChatModel` objects are effectively configuration objects. You can initialize them with parameters like `temperature` and others, and pass them around. ```python from langchain.schema import HumanMessage text = ""What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"" messages = [HumanMessage(content=text)] llm.invoke(text) # >> Feetful of Fun chat_model.invoke(messages) # >> AIMessage(content=""Socks O\'Color"") ``` Go deeper `LLM.invoke` and `ChatModel.invoke` actually both support as input any of `Union[str, List[BaseMessage], PromptValue]`. `PromptValue` is an object that defines it\'s own custom logic for returning it\'s inputs either as a string or as messages. `LLM`s have logic for coercing any of these into a string, and `ChatModel`s have logic for coercing any of these to messages. The fact that `LLM` and `ChatModel` accept the same inputs means that you can directly swap them for one another in most chains without breaking anything, though it\'s of course important to think about how inputs are being coerced and how that may affect model performance. To dive deeper on models head to the [Language models](/docs/modules/model_io/models) section. ### Prompt templates Most LLM applications do not pass user input directly into an LLM. Usually they will add the user input to a larger piece of text, called a prompt template, that provides additional context on the specific task at hand. In the previous example, the text we passed to the model contained instructions to generate a company name. For our application, it would be great if the user only had to provide the description of a company/product, without having to worry about giving the model instructions. PromptTemplates help with exactly this! They bundle up all the logic for going from user input into a fully formatted prompt. This can start off very simple - for example, a prompt to produce the above string would just be: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"") prompt.format(product=""colorful socks"") ``` ```python What is a good name for a company that makes colorful socks? ``` However, the advantages of using these over raw string formatting are several. You can ""partial"" out variables - e.g. you can format only some of the variables at a time. You can compose them together, easily combining different templates into a single prompt. For explanations of these functionalities, see the [section on prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts) for more detail. `PromptTemplate`s can also be used to produce a list of messages. In this case, the prompt not only contains information about the content, but also each message (its role, its position in the list, etc.). Here, what happens most often is a `ChatPromptTemplate` is a list of `ChatMessageTemplates`. Each `ChatMessageTemplate` contains instructions for how to format that `ChatMessage` - its role, and then also its content. Let\'s take a look at this below: ```python from langchain.prompts.chat import ChatPromptTemplate template = ""You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}."" human_template = ""{text}"" chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", template), (""human"", human_template), ]) chat_prompt.format_messages(input_language=""English"", output_language=""French"", text=""I love programming."") ``` ```pycon [ SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."", additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming."") ] ``` ChatPromptTemplates can also be constructed in other ways - see the [section on prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts) for more detail. ### Output parsers `OutputParsers` convert the raw output of a language model into a format that can be used downstream. There are few main types of `OutputParser`s, including: - Convert text from `LLM` into structured information (e.g. JSON) - Convert a `ChatMessage` into just a string - Convert the extra information returned from a call besides the message (like OpenAI function invocation) into a string. For full information on this, see the [section on output parsers](/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers). In this getting started guide, we will write our own output parser - one that converts a comma separated list into a list. ```python from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""""" def parse(self, text: str): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call."""""" return text.strip().split("", "") CommaSeparatedListOutputParser().parse(""hi, bye"") # >> [\'hi\', \'bye\'] ``` ### Composing with LCEL We can now combine all these into one chain. This chain will take input variables, pass those to a prompt template to create a prompt, pass the prompt to a language model, and then pass the output through an (optional) output parser. This is a convenient way to bundle up a modular piece of logic. Let\'s see it in action! ```python from typing import List from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser[List[str]]): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""""" def parse(self, text: str) -> List[str]: """"""Parse the output of an LLM call."""""" return text.strip().split("", "") template = """"""You are a helpful assistant who generates comma separated lists. A user will pass in a category, and you should generate 5 objects in that category in a comma separated list. ONLY return a comma separated list, and nothing more."""""" human_template = ""{text}"" chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", template), (""human"", human_template), ]) chain = chat_prompt | ChatOpenAI() | CommaSeparatedListOutputParser() chain.invoke({""text"": ""colors""}) # >> [\'red\', \'blue\', \'green\', \'yellow\', \'orange\'] ``` Note that we are using the `|` syntax to join these components together. This `|` syntax is powered by the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) and relies on the universal `Runnable` interface that all of these objects implement. To learn more about LCEL, read the documentation [here](/docs/expression_language). ## Tracing with LangSmith Assuming we\'ve set our environment variables as shown in the beginning, all of the model and chain calls we\'ve been making will have been automatically logged to LangSmith. Once there, we can use LangSmith to debug and annotate our application traces, then turn them into datasets for evaluating future iterations of the application. Check out what the trace for the above chain would look like: [ For more on LangSmith [head here](/docs/langsmith/). ## Serving with LangServe Now that we\'ve built an application, we need to serve it. That\'s where LangServe comes in. LangServe helps developers deploy LCEL chains as a REST API. The library is integrated with FastAPI and uses pydantic for data validation. ### Server To create a server for our application we\'ll make a `serve.py` file with three things: 1. The definition of our chain (same as above) 2. Our FastAPI app 3. A definition of a route from which to serve the chain, which is done with `langserve.add_routes` ```python #!/usr/bin/env python from typing import List from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import BaseOutputParser from langserve import add_routes # 1. Chain definition class CommaSeparatedListOutputParser(BaseOutputParser[List[str]]): """"""Parse the output of an LLM call to a comma-separated list."""""" def parse(self, text: str) -> List[str]: """"""Parse the output of an LLM call."""""" return text.strip().split("", "") template = """"""You are a helpful assistant who generates comma separated lists. A user will pass in a category, and you should generate 5 objects in that category in a comma separated list. ONLY return a comma separated list, and nothing more."""""" human_template = ""{text}"" chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", template), (""human"", human_template), ]) category_chain = chat_prompt | ChatOpenAI() | CommaSeparatedListOutputParser() # 2. App definition app = FastAPI( title=""LangChain Server"", version=""1.0"", description=""A simple api server using Langchain\'s Runnable interfaces"", ) # 3. Adding chain route add_routes( app, category_chain, path=""/category_chain"", ) if __name__ == ""__main__"": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, host=""localhost"", port=8000) ``` And that\'s it! If we execute this file: ```bash python serve.py ``` we should see our chain being served at localhost:8000. ### Playground Every LangServe service comes with a simple built-in UI for configuring and invoking the application with streaming output and visibility into intermediate steps. Head to to try it out! ### Client Now let\'s set up a client for programmatically interacting with our service. We can easily do this with the `langserve.RemoteRunnable`. Using this, we can interact with the served chain as if it were running client-side. ```python from langserve import RemoteRunnable remote_chain = RemoteRunnable("" remote_chain.invoke({""text"": ""colors""}) # >> [\'red\', \'blue\', \'green\', \'yellow\', \'orange\'] ``` To learn more about the many other features of LangServe [head here](/docs/langserve). ## Next steps We\'ve touched on how to build an application with LangChain, how to trace it with LangSmith, and how to serve it with LangServe. There are a lot more features in all three of these than we can cover here.

It provides several benefits for building applications:

- Async, Batch, and Streaming Support: LCEL chains have full sync, async, batch, and streaming support, making it easy to prototype in a Jupyter notebook and then expose it as an async streaming interface.
- Fallbacks: LCEL allows you to easily attach fallbacks to any chain, handling errors gracefully.
- Parallelism: LCEL syntax automatically runs components that can be run in parallel.
- Seamless LangSmith Tracing Integration: LCEL logs all steps to LangSmith for observability and debuggability. [0]

LCEL provides an intuitive and readable syntax for composition and supports streaming, async calls, batching, parallelization, retries, and more. It allows you to combine different components, such as prompts, models, and output parsers, to build powerful applications. LCEL chains can be called synchronously or asynchronously, and they support intermediate result access, input/output schemas, and tracing with LangSmith.

To overcome these manual and expensive processes, Textract uses ML to read and process any type of document, accurately extracting text, handwriting, tables, and other data with no manual effort.

There are multiple use cases where this is beneficial. LangChain has a base `MultiVectorRetriever` which makes querying this type of setup easy. A lot of the complexity lies in how to create the multiple vectors per document. This notebook covers some of the common ways to create those vectors and use the `MultiVectorRetriever`. The methods to create multiple vectors per document include: - Smaller chunks: split a document into smaller chunks, and embed those (this is ParentDocumentRetriever). - Summary: create a summary for each document, embed that along with (or instead of) the document. - Hypothetical questions: create hypothetical questions that each document would be appropriate to answer, embed those along with (or instead of) the document. Note that this also enables another method of adding embeddings - manually. This is great because you can explicitly add questions or queries that should lead to a document being recovered, giving you more control. ```python from langchain.retrievers.multi_vector import MultiVectorRetriever ``` ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.storage import InMemoryStore from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loaders = [ TextLoader(""../../paul_graham_essay.txt""), TextLoader(""../../state_of_the_union.txt""), ] docs = [] for l in loaders: docs.extend(l.load()) text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=10000) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ## Smaller chunks Often times it can be useful to retrieve larger chunks of information, but embed smaller chunks. This allows for embeddings to capture the semantic meaning as closely as possible, but for as much context as possible to be passed downstream. Note that this is what the `ParentDocumentRetriever` does. Here we show what is going on under the hood. ```python # The vectorstore to use to index the child chunks vectorstore = Chroma( collection_name=""full_documents"", embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddings() ) # The storage layer for the parent documents store = InMemoryStore() id_key = ""doc_id"" # The retriever (empty to start) retriever = MultiVectorRetriever( vectorstore=vectorstore, docstore=store, id_key=id_key, ) import uuid doc_ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in docs] ``` ```python # The splitter to use to create smaller chunks child_text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=400) ``` ```python sub_docs = [] for i, doc in enumerate(docs): _id = doc_ids[i] _sub_docs = child_text_splitter.split_documents([doc]) for _doc in _sub_docs: _doc.metadata[id_key] = _id sub_docs.extend(_sub_docs) ``` ```python retriever.vectorstore.add_documents(sub_docs) retriever.docstore.mset(list(zip(doc_ids, docs))) ``` ```python # Vectorstore alone retrieves the small chunks retriever.vectorstore.similarity_search(""justice breyer"")[0] ``` ```text Document(page_content=\'Tonight, I\'d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyeran Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

68,What is an agent,"['ReAct | ReAct This walkthrough showcases using an agent to implement the [ReAct]( logic. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` First, let\'s load the language model we\'re going to use to control the agent. ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) ``` Next, let\'s load some tools to use. Note that the `llm-math` tool uses an LLM, so we need to pass that in. ```python tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm) ``` ## Using LCEL We will first show how to create the agent using LCEL ```python from langchain import hub from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_log_to_str from langchain.agents.output_parsers import ReActSingleInputOutputParser from langchain.tools.render import render_text_description ``` ```python prompt = hub.pull(""hwchase17/react"") prompt = prompt.partial( tools=render_text_description(tools), tool_names="", "".join([t.name for t in tools]), ) ``` ```python llm_with_stop = llm.bind(stop=[""\\nObservation""]) ``` ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_log_to_str(x[""intermediate_steps""]), } | prompt | llm_with_stop | ReActSingleInputOutputParser() ) ``` ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` ```python agent_executor.invoke( { ""input"": ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?"" } ) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I need to find out who Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend is and then calculate her age raised to the 0.43 power. Action: Search Action Input: ""Leo DiCaprio girlfriend""model Vittoria Ceretti I need to find out Vittoria Ceretti\'s age Action: Search Action Input: ""Vittoria Ceretti age""25 years I need to calculate 25 raised to the 0.43 power Action: Calculator Action Input: 25^0.43Answer: 3.991298452658078 I now know the final answer Final Answer: Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend is Vittoria Ceretti and her current age raised to the 0.43 power is 3.991298452658078. > Finished chain. {\'input\': ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?

The main difference here is a different prompt. We will use JSON to encode the agent\'s actions (chat models are a bit tougher to steet, so using JSON helps to enforce the output format). ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python chat_model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python prompt = hub.pull(""hwchase17/react-json"") prompt = prompt.partial( tools=render_text_description(tools), tool_names="", "".join([t.name for t in tools]), ) ``` ```python chat_model_with_stop = chat_model.bind(stop=[""\\nObservation""]) ``` ```python from langchain.agents.output_parsers import ReActJsonSingleInputOutputParser ``` ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_log_to_str(x[""intermediate_steps""]), } | prompt | chat_model_with_stop | ReActJsonSingleInputOutputParser() ) ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` ```python agent_executor.invoke( { ""input"": ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?"" } ) ``` We can also use an off-the-shelf agent class ```python agent = initialize_agent( tools, chat_model, agent=AgentType.CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?"" ) ``` - [Using LCEL](#using-lcel) - [Using ZeroShotReactAgent](#using-zeroshotreactagent) - [Using chat models](#using-chat-models)', 'Access intermediate steps | Access intermediate steps In order to get more visibility into what an agent is doing, we can also return intermediate steps. This comes in the form of an extra key in the return value, which is a list of (action, observation) tuples. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` Initialize the components needed for the agent. ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, model_name=""text-davinci-002"") tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm) ``` Initialize the agent with `return_intermediate_steps=True`: ```python agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True, ) ``` ```python response = agent( { ""input"": ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?

An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API currently supports three types of tools: Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function calling You can interact with OpenAI Assistants using OpenAI tools or custom tools. When using exclusively OpenAI tools, you can just invoke the assistant directly and get final answers. When using custom tools, you can run the assistant and tool execution loop using the built-in AgentExecutor or easily write your own executor. Below we show the different ways to interact with Assistants.

Write and run code to answer math questions."", tools=[{""type"": ""code_interpreter""}], model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"", ) output = interpreter_assistant.invoke({""content"": ""What\'s 10 - 4 raised to the 2.7""}) output ``` ```text [ThreadMessage(id=\'msg_qgxkD5kvkZyl0qOaL4czPFkZ\', assistant_id=\'asst_0T8S7CJuUa4Y4hm1PF6n62v7\', content=[MessageContentText(text=Text(annotations=[], value=\'The result of the calculation \\\\(10 - 4^{2.7}\\\\) is approximately \\\\(-32.224\\\\).\'), type=\'text\')], created_at=1700169519, file_ids=[], metadata={}, object=\'thread.message\', role=\'assistant\', run_id=\'run_aH3ZgSWNk3vYIBQm3vpE8tr4\', thread_id=\'thread_9K6cYfx1RBh0pOWD8SxwVWW9\')] ``` ### As a LangChain agent with arbitrary tools Now let\'s recreate this functionality using our own tools. For this example we\'ll use the [E2B sandbox runtime tool]( ```bash pip install e2b duckduckgo-search ``` ```python import getpass from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun, E2BDataAnalysisTool tools = [E2BDataAnalysisTool(api_key=getpass.getpass()), DuckDuckGoSearchRun()] ``` ```python agent = OpenAIAssistantRunnable.create_assistant( name=""langchain assistant e2b tool"", instructions=""You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions. You can also search the internet."", tools=tools, model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"", as_agent=True, ) ``` #### Using AgentExecutor The OpenAIAssistantRunnable is compatible with the AgentExecutor, so we can pass it in as an agent directly to the executor. The AgentExecutor handles calling the invoked tools and uploading the tool outputs back to the Assistants API. Plus it comes with built-in LangSmith tracing. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools) agent_executor.invoke({""content"": ""What\'s the weather in SF today divided by 2.7""}) ``` ```text {\'content\': ""What\'s the weather in SF today divided by 2.7"", \'output\': ""The search results indicate that the weather in San Francisco is 67 F. Now I will divide this temperature by 2.7 and provide you with the result. Please note that this is a mathematical operation and does not represent a meaningful physical quantity.\\n\\nLet\'s calculate 67 F divided by 2.7.\\nThe result of dividing the current temperature in San Francisco, which is 67 F, by 2.7 is approximately 24.815."", \'thread_id\': \'thread_hcpYI0tfpB9mHa9d95W7nK2B\', \'run_id\': \'run_qOuVmPXS9xlV3XNPcfP8P9W2\'} ``` [LangSmith trace]( Custom execution Or with LCEL we can easily write our own execution loop for running the assistant. This gives us full control over execution. ```python agent = OpenAIAssistantRunnable.create_assistant( name=""langchain assistant e2b tool"", instructions=""You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions."", tools=tools, model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"", as_agent=True, ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.agent import AgentFinish def execute_agent(agent, tools, input): tool_map = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools} response = agent.invoke(input) while not isinstance(response, AgentFinish): tool_outputs = [] for action in response: tool_output = tool_map[action.tool].invoke(action.tool_input) print(action.tool, action.tool_input, tool_output, end=""\\n\\n"") tool_outputs.append( {""output"": tool_output, ""tool_call_id"": action.tool_call_id} ) response = agent.invoke( { ""tool_outputs"": tool_outputs, ""run_id"": action.run_id, ""thread_id"": action.thread_id, } ) return response ``` ```python response = execute_agent(agent, tools, {""content"": ""What\'s 10 - 4 raised to the 2.7""}) print(response.return_values[""output""]) ``` ```text e2b_data_analysis {\'python_code\': \'result = 10 - 4 ** 2.7\\nprint(result)\'} {""stdout"": ""-32.22425314473263"", ""stderr"": """", ""artifacts"": []} \\( 10 - 4^{2.7} \\) equals approximately -32.224. ``` ## Using existing Thread To use an existing thread we just need to pass the ""thread_id"" in when invoking the agent. ```python next_response = execute_agent( agent, tools, {""content"": ""now add 17.241"", ""thread_id"": response.return_values[""thread_id""]}, ) print(next_response.return_values[""output""]) ``` ```text e2b_data_analysis {\'python_code\': \'result = 10 - 4 ** 2.7 + 17.241\\nprint(result)\'} {""stdout"": ""-14.983253144732629"", ""stderr"": """", ""artifacts"": []} \\( 10 - 4^{2.7} + 17.241 \\) equals approximately -14.983. ``` ## Using existing Assistant To use an existing Assistant we can initialize the `OpenAIAssistantRunnable` directly with an `assistant_id`. ```python agent = OpenAIAssistantRunnable(assistant_id="""", as_agent=True) ``` - [Using only OpenAI tools](#using-only-openai-tools) - [As a LangChain agent with arbitrary tools](#as-a-langchain-agent-with-arbitrary-tools) - [Using existing Thread](#using-existing-thread) - [Using existing Assistant](#using-existing-assistant)', 'Multi-Input Tools | Multi-Input Tools This notebook shows how to use a tool that requires multiple inputs with an agent. The recommended way to do so is with the `StructuredTool` class. ```python import os os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING""] = ""true"" ``` ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.llms import OpenAI llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python from langchain.tools import StructuredTool def multiplier(a: float, b: float) -> float: """"""Multiply the provided floats."""""" return a * b tool = StructuredTool.from_function(multiplier) ``` ```python # Structured tools are compatible with the STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION agent type. agent_executor = initialize_agent( [tool], llm, agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python agent_executor.run(""What is 3 times 4"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

The tool would then have to handle the parsing logic to extract the relevant values from the text, which tightly couples the tool representation to the agent prompt. This is still useful if the underlying language model can\'t reliably generate structured schema. Let\'s take the multiplication function as an example. In order to use this, we will tell the agent to generate the ""Action Input"" as a comma-separated list of length two. We will then write a thin wrapper that takes a string, splits it into two around a comma, and passes both parsed sides as integers to the multiplication function. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` Here is the multiplication function, as well as a wrapper to parse a string as input. ```python def multiplier(a, b): return a * b def parsing_multiplier(string): a, b = string.split("","") return multiplier(int(a), int(b)) ``` ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) tools = [ Tool( name=""Multiplier"", func=parsing_multiplier, description=""useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together.

To use, you should have the redis python package installed and have a running Redis Enterprise or Redis-Stack server For production use cases, it is recommended to use Redis Enterprise as the scaling, performance, stability and availability is much better than Redis-Stack. For testing and prototyping, however, this is not required. Redis-Stack is available as a docker container the full vector search API available. # to run redis stack in docker locally docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest Once running, you can connect to the redis server with the following url schemas: - redis://: # simple connection - redis://:@: # connection with authentication - rediss://: # connection with SSL - rediss://:@: # connection with SSL and auth Examples: The following examples show various ways to use the Redis VectorStore with LangChain. For all the following examples assume we have the following imports: from langchain.vectorstores import Redis from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings Initialize, create index, and load Documentsfrom langchain.vectorstores import Redis from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings rds = Redis.from_documents( documents, # a list of Document objects from loaders or created embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize, create index, and load Documents with metadatards = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize, create index, and load Documents with metadata and return keys rds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) For use cases where the index needs to stay alive, you can initialize with an index name such that it\'s easier to reference later rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_name=""my-index"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize and connect to an existing index (from above) rds = Redis.from_existing_index( embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_name=""my-index"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Advanced examples: Custom vector schema can be supplied to change the way that Redis creates the underlying vector schema. This is useful for production use cases where you want to optimize the vector schema for your use case. ex. using HNSW instead of FLAT (knn) which is the default vector_schema = { ""algorithm"": ""HNSW"" } rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object vector_schema=vector_schema, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Custom index schema can be supplied to change the way that the metadata is indexed. This is useful for you would like to use the hybrid querying (filtering) capability of Redis. By default, this implementation will automatically generate the index schema according to the following rules: All strings are indexed as text fields All numbers are indexed as numeric fields All lists of strings are indexed as tag fields (joined bylangchain.vectorstores.redis.constants.REDIS_TAG_SEPARATOR) All None values are not indexed but still stored in Redis these arenot retrievable through the interface here, but the raw Redis client can be used to retrieve them. All other types are not indexed To override these rules, you can pass in a custom index schema like the following tag: - name: credit_score text: - name: user - name: job Typically, the credit_score field would be a text field since it\'s a string, however, we can override this behavior by specifying the field type as shown with the yaml config (can also be a dictionary) above and the code below. rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_schema=""path/to/index_schema.yaml"", # can also be a dictionary redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) When connecting to an existing index where a custom schema has been applied, it\'s important to pass in the same schema to the from_existing_index method. Otherwise, the schema for newly added samples will be incorrect and metadata will not be returned. Initialize with necessary components.

Last updated on Nov 17, 2023. Show this page source', 'Redis | Redis [Redis (Remote Dictionary Server)]( is an open-source in-memory storage, used as a distributed, in-memory keyvalue database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Because it holds all data in memory and because of its design, `Redis` offers low-latency reads and writes, making it particularly suitable for use cases that require a cache. Redis is the most popular NoSQL database, and one of the most popular databases overall. This page covers how to use the [Redis]( ecosystem within LangChain. It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Redis wrappers. ## Installation and Setup Install the Python SDK: ```bash pip install redis ``` ## Wrappers All wrappers need a redis url connection string to connect to the database support either a stand alone Redis server or a High-Availability setup with Replication and Redis Sentinels. ### Redis Standalone connection url For standalone `Redis` server, the official redis connection url formats can be used as describe in the python redis modules ""from_url()"" method [Redis.from_url]( Example: `redis_url = ""redis://:secret-pass@localhost:6379/0""` ### Redis Sentinel connection url For [Redis sentinel setups]( the connection scheme is ""redis+sentinel"". This is an unofficial extensions to the official IANA registered protocol schemes as long as there is no connection url for Sentinels available. Example: `redis_url = ""redis+sentinel://:secret-pass@sentinel-host:26379/mymaster/0""` The format is `redis+sentinel://[[username]:[password]]@[host-or-ip]:[port]/[service-name]/[db-number]` with the default values of ""service-name = mymaster"" and ""db-number = 0"" if not set explicit. The service-name is the redis server monitoring group name as configured within the Sentinel. The current url format limits the connection string to one sentinel host only (no list can be given) and booth Redis server and sentinel must have the same password set (if used). ### Redis Cluster connection url Redis cluster is not supported right now for all methods requiring a ""redis_url"" parameter. The only way to use a Redis Cluster is with LangChain classes accepting a preconfigured Redis client like `RedisCache` (example below). ### Cache The Cache wrapper allows for [Redis]( to be used as a remote, low-latency, in-memory cache for LLM prompts and responses. #### Standard Cache The standard cache is the Redis bread & butter of use case in production for both [open-source]( and [enterprise]( users globally. To import this cache: ```python from langchain.cache import RedisCache ``` To use this cache with your LLMs: ```python from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache import redis redis_client = redis.Redis.from_url(...) set_llm_cache(RedisCache(redis_client)) ``` #### Semantic Cache Semantic caching allows users to retrieve cached prompts based on semantic similarity between the user input and previously cached results. Under the hood it blends Redis as both a cache and a vectorstore. To import this cache: ```python from langchain.cache import RedisSemanticCache ``` To use this cache with your LLMs: ```python from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache import redis # use any embedding provider... from tests.integration_tests.vectorstores.fake_embeddings import FakeEmbeddings redis_url = ""redis://localhost:6379"" set_llm_cache(RedisSemanticCache( embedding=FakeEmbeddings(), redis_url=redis_url )) ``` ### VectorStore The vectorstore wrapper turns Redis into a low-latency [vector database]( for semantic search or LLM content retrieval. To import this vectorstore: ```python from langchain.vectorstores import Redis ``` For a more detailed walkthrough of the Redis vectorstore wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis). ### Retriever The Redis vector store retriever wrapper generalizes the vectorstore class to perform low-latency document retrieval. To create the retriever, simply call `.as_retriever()` on the base vectorstore class. ### Memory Redis can be used to persist LLM conversations. #### Vector Store Retriever Memory For a more detailed walkthrough of the `VectorStoreRetrieverMemory` wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/modules/memory/types/vectorstore_retriever_memory). #### Chat Message History Memory For a detailed example of Redis to cache conversation message history, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/memory/redis_chat_message_history). - [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) - [Wrappers](#wrappers)- [Redis Standalone connection url](#redis-standalone-connection-url) - [Redis Sentinel connection url](#redis-sentinel-connection-url) - [Redis Cluster connection url](#redis-cluster-connection-url) - [Cache](#cache) - [VectorStore](#vectorstore) - [Retriever](#retriever) - [Memory](#memory)', 'Redis | Redis Redis vector database introduction and langchain integration guide. ## What is Redis? Most developers from a web services background are probably familiar with Redis. At it\'s core, Redis is an open-source key-value store that can be used as a cache, message broker, and database. Developers choose Redis because it is fast, has a large ecosystem of client libraries, and has been deployed by major enterprises for years. On top of these traditional use cases, Redis provides additional capabilities like the Search and Query capability that allows users to create secondary index structures within Redis. This allows Redis to be a Vector Database, at the speed of a cache. ## Redis as a Vector Database Redis uses compressed, inverted indexes for fast indexing with a low memory footprint. It also supports a number of advanced features such as: - Indexing of multiple fields in Redis hashes and JSON - Vector similarity search (with HNSW (ANN) or FLAT (KNN)) - Vector Range Search (e.g. find all vectors within a radius of a query vector) - Incremental indexing without performance loss - Document ranking (using [tf-idf]( with optional user-provided weights) - Field weighting - Complex boolean queries with AND, OR, and NOT operators - Prefix matching, fuzzy matching, and exact-phrase queries - Support for [double-metaphone phonetic matching]( - Auto-complete suggestions (with fuzzy prefix suggestions) - Stemming-based query expansion in [many languages]( (using [Snowball]( - Support for Chinese-language tokenization and querying (using [Friso]( - Numeric filters and ranges - Geospatial searches using [Redis geospatial indexing](/commands/georadius) - A powerful aggregations engine - Supports for all utf-8 encoded text - Retrieve full documents, selected fields, or only the document IDs - Sorting results (for example, by creation date) ## Clients Since redis is much more than just a vector database, there are often use cases that demand usage of a Redis client besides just the langchain integration. You can use any standard Redis client library to run Search and Query commands, but it\'s easiest to use a library that wraps the Search and Query API. Below are a few examples, but you can find more client libraries [here]( | Project | Language | License | Author | Stars | | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | | jedis | Java | MIT | Redis | | | redisvl | Python | MIT | Redis | | | redis-py | Python | MIT | Redis | | | node-redis | Node.js | MIT | Redis | | | nredisstack | .NET | MIT | Redis | | ## Deployment Options There are many ways to deploy Redis with RediSearch. The easiest way to get started is to use Docker, but there are are many potential options for deployment such as - [Redis Cloud]( - [Docker (Redis Stack)]( - Cloud marketplaces: [AWS Marketplace]( [Google Marketplace]( or [Azure Marketplace]( - On-premise: [Redis Enterprise Software]( - Kubernetes: [Redis Enterprise Software on Kubernetes]( ## Examples Many examples can be found in the [Redis AI team\'s GitHub]( - [Awesome Redis AI Resources]( - List of examples of using Redis in AI workloads - [Azure OpenAI Embeddings Q&A]( - OpenAI and Redis as a Q&A service on Azure. - [ArXiv Paper Search]( - Semantic search over arXiv scholarly papers - [Vector Search on Azure]( - Vector search on Azure using Azure Cache for Redis and Azure OpenAI ## More Resources For more information on how to use Redis as a vector database, check out the following resources: - [RedisVL Documentation]( - Documentation for the Redis Vector Library Client - [Redis Vector Similarity Docs]( - Redis official docs for Vector Search. - [Redis-py Search Docs]( - Documentation for redis-py client library - [Vector Similarity Search: From Basics to Production]( - Introductory blog post to VSS and Redis as a VectorDB. ## Install Redis Python Client Redis-py is the officially supported client by Redis. Recently released is the RedisVL client which is purpose-built for the Vector Database use cases. Both can be installed with pip. ```bash pip install redis redisvl openai tiktoken ``` We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ## Sample Data First we will describe some sample data so that the various attributes of the Redis vector store can be demonstrated. ```python metadata = [ { ""user"": ""john"", ""age"": 18, ""job"": ""engineer"", ""credit_score"": ""high"", }, { ""user"": ""derrick"", ""age"": 45, ""job"": ""doctor"", ""credit_score"": ""low"", }, { ""user"": ""nancy"", ""age"": 94, ""job"": ""doctor"", ""credit_score"": ""high"", }, { ""user"": ""tyler"", ""age"": 100, ""job"": ""engineer"", ""credit_score"": ""high"", }, { ""user"": ""joe"", ""age"": 35, ""job"": ""dentist"", ""credit_score"": ""medium"", }, ] texts = [""foo"", ""foo"", ""foo"", ""bar"", ""bar""] ``` ## Initializing Redis To locally deploy Redis, run: ```console docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest ``` If things are running correctly you should see a nice Redis UI at See the [Deployment Options](#deployment-options) section above for other ways to deploy. The Redis VectorStore instance can be initialized in a number of ways. There are multiple class methods that can be used to initialize a Redis VectorStore instance. - `Redis.__init__` - Initialize directly - `Redis.from_documents` - Initialize from a list of `Langchain.docstore.Document` objects - `Redis.from_texts` - Initialize from a list of texts (optionally with metadata) - `Redis.from_texts_return_keys` - Initialize from a list of texts (optionally with metadata) and return the keys - `Redis.from_existing_index` - Initialize from an existing Redis index Below we will use the `Redis.from_texts` method. ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import Redis rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, embeddings, metadatas=metadata, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", index_name=""users"", ) ``` ```python rds.index_name ``` ```text \'users\' ``` ## Inspecting the Created Index Once the `Redis` VectorStore object has been constructed, an index will have been created in Redis if it did not already exist. The index can be inspected with both the `rvl`and the `redis-cli` command line tool. If you installed `redisvl` above, you can use the `rvl` command line tool to inspect the index. ```bash # assumes you\'re running Redis locally (use --host, --port, --password, --username, to change this) rvl index listall ``` ```text 16:58:26 [RedisVL] INFO Indices: 16:58:26 [RedisVL] INFO 1. users ``` The `Redis` VectorStore implementation will attempt to generate index schema (fields for filtering) for any metadata passed through the `from_texts`, `from_texts_return_keys`, and `from_documents` methods. This way, whatever metadata is passed will be indexed into the Redis search index allowing for filtering on those fields. Below we show what fields were created from the metadata we defined above ```bash rvl index info -i users ``` ```text Index Information: Index Name Storage Type Prefixes Index Options Indexing users HASH [\'doc:users\'] [] 0 Index Fields: Name Attribute Type Field Option Option Value user user TEXT WEIGHT 1 job job TEXT WEIGHT 1 credit_score credit_score TEXT WEIGHT 1 content content TEXT WEIGHT 1 age age NUMERIC content_vector content_vector VECTOR ``` ```bash rvl stats -i users ``` ```text Statistics: Stat Key Value num_docs 5 num_terms 15 max_doc_id 5 num_records 33 percent_indexed 1 hash_indexing_failures 0 number_of_uses 4 bytes_per_record_avg 4.60606 doc_table_size_mb 0.000524521 inverted_sz_mb 0.000144958 key_table_size_mb 0.000193596 offset_bits_per_record_avg 8 offset_vectors_sz_mb 2.19345e-05 offsets_per_term_avg 0.69697 records_per_doc_avg 6.6 sortable_values_size_mb 0 total_indexing_time 0.32 total_inverted_index_blocks 16 vector_index_sz_mb 6.0126 ``` It\'s important to note that we have not specified that the `user`, `job`, `credit_score` and `age` in the metadata should be fields within the index, this is because the `Redis` VectorStore object automatically generate the index schema from the passed metadata. For more information on the generation of index fields, see the API documentation. ## Querying\u200b There are multiple ways to query the `Redis` VectorStore implementation based on what use case you have: - `similarity_search`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector. - `similarity_search_with_score`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector and return the vector distance - `similarity_search_limit_score`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector and limit the number of results to the `score_threshold` - `similarity_search_with_relevance_scores`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector and return the vector similarities - `max_marginal_relevance_search`: Find the most similar vectors to a given vector while also optimizing for diversity ```python results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"") print(results[0].page_content) ``` ```text foo ``` ```python # return metadata results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3) meta = results[1].metadata print(""Key of the document in Redis: "", meta.pop(""id"")) print(""Metadata of the document: "", meta) ``` ```text Key of the document in Redis: doc:users:a70ca43b3a4e4168bae57c78753a200f Metadata of the document: {\'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'} ``` ```python # with scores (distances) results = rds.similarity_search_with_score(""foo"", k=5) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Score: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: bar --- Score: 0.1566 Content: bar --- Score: 0.1566 ``` ```python # limit the vector distance that can be returned results = rds.similarity_search_with_score(""foo"", k=5, distance_threshold=0.1) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Score: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 ``` ```python # with scores results = rds.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(""foo"", k=5) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Similiarity: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Similiarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similiarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similiarity: 1.0 Content: bar --- Similiarity: 0.8434 Content: bar --- Similiarity: 0.8434 ``` ```python # limit scores (similarities have to be over .9) results = rds.similarity_search_with_relevance_scores(""foo"", k=5, score_threshold=0.9) for result in results: print(f""Content: {result[0].page_content} --- Similarity: {result[1]}"") ``` ```text Content: foo --- Similarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similarity: 1.0 Content: foo --- Similarity: 1.0 ``` ```python # you can also add new documents as follows new_document = [""baz""] new_metadata = [{""user"": ""sam"", ""age"": 50, ""job"": ""janitor"", ""credit_score"": ""high""}] # both the document and metadata must be lists rds.add_texts(new_document, new_metadata) ``` ```text [\'doc:users:b9c71d62a0a34241a37950b448dafd38\'] ``` ```python # now query the new document results = rds.similarity_search(""baz"", k=3) print(results[0].metadata) ``` ```text {\'id\': \'doc:users:b9c71d62a0a34241a37950b448dafd38\', \'user\': \'sam\', \'job\': \'janitor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'50\'} ``` ```python # use maximal marginal relevance search to diversify results results = rds.max_marginal_relevance_search(""foo"") ``` ```python # the lambda_mult parameter controls the diversity of the results, the lower the more diverse results = rds.max_marginal_relevance_search(""foo"", lambda_mult=0.1) ``` ## Connect to an Existing Index\u200b In order to have the same metadata indexed when using the `Redis` VectorStore. You will need to have the same `index_schema` passed in either as a path to a yaml file or as a dictionary. The following shows how to obtain the schema from an index and connect to an existing index. ```python # write the schema to a yaml file rds.write_schema(""redis_schema.yaml"") ``` The schema file for this example should look something like: ```yaml numeric: - name: age no_index: false sortable: false text: - name: user no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false - name: job no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false - name: credit_score no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false - name: content no_index: false no_stem: false sortable: false weight: 1 withsuffixtrie: false vector: - algorithm: FLAT block_size: 1000 datatype: FLOAT32 dims: 1536 distance_metric: COSINE initial_cap: 20000 name: content_vector ``` **Notice**, this include **all** possible fields for the schema. You can remove any fields that you don\'t need. ```python # now we can connect to our existing index as follows new_rds = Redis.from_existing_index( embeddings, index_name=""users"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", schema=""redis_schema.yaml"", ) results = new_rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3) print(results[0].metadata) ``` ```text {\'id\': \'doc:users:8484c48a032d4c4cbe3cc2ed6845fabb\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'} ``` ```python # see the schemas are the same new_rds.schema == rds.schema ``` ```text True ``` ## Custom Metadata Indexing\u200b In some cases, you may want to control what fields the metadata maps to. For example, you may want the `credit_score` field to be a categorical field instead of a text field (which is the default behavior for all string fields). In this case, you can use the `index_schema` parameter in each of the initialization methods above to specify the schema for the index. Custom index schema can either be passed as a dictionary or as a path to a yaml file. All arguments in the schema have defaults besides the name, so you can specify only the fields you want to change. All the names correspond to the snake/lowercase versions of the arguments you would use on the command line with `redis-cli` or in `redis-py`. For more on the arguments for each field, see the [documentation]( The below example shows how to specify the schema for the `credit_score` field as a Tag (categorical) field instead of a text field. ```yaml # index_schema.yml tag: - name: credit_score text: - name: user - name: job numeric: - name: age ``` In Python this would look like: ```python index_schema = { ""tag"": [{""name"": ""credit_score""}], ""text"": [{""name"": ""user""}, {""name"": ""job""}], ""numeric"": [{""name"": ""age""}], } ``` Notice that only the `name` field needs to be specified. All other fields have defaults. ```python # create a new index with the new schema defined above index_schema = { ""tag"": [{""name"": ""credit_score""}], ""text"": [{""name"": ""user""}, {""name"": ""job""}], ""numeric"": [{""name"": ""age""}], } rds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys( texts, embeddings, metadatas=metadata, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", index_name=""users_modified"", index_schema=index_schema, # pass in the new index schema ) ``` ```text `index_schema` does not match generated metadata schema. If you meant to manually override the schema, please ignore this message. index_schema: {\'tag\': [{\'name\': \'credit_score\'}], \'text\': [{\'name\': \'user\'}, {\'name\': \'job\'}], \'numeric\': [{\'name\': \'age\'}]} generated_schema: {\'text\': [{\'name\': \'user\'}, {\'name\': \'job\'}, {\'name\': \'credit_score\'}], \'numeric\': [{\'name\': \'age\'}], \'tag\': []} ``` The above warning is meant to notify users when they are overriding the default behavior. Ignore it if you are intentionally overriding the behavior. ## Hybrid Filtering\u200b With the Redis Filter Expression language built into langchain, you can create arbitrarily long chains of hybrid filters that can be used to filter your search results. The expression language is derived from the [RedisVL Expression Syntax]( and is designed to be easy to use and understand. The following are the available filter types: - `RedisText`: Filter by full-text search against metadata fields. Supports exact, fuzzy, and wildcard matching. - `RedisNum`: Filter by numeric range against metadata fields. - `RedisTag`: Filter by exact match against string based categorical metadata fields. Multiple tags can be specified like ""tag1,tag2,tag3"". The following are examples of utilizing these filters. ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisText, RedisNum, RedisTag # exact matching has_high_credit = RedisTag(""credit_score"") == ""high"" does_not_have_high_credit = RedisTag(""credit_score"") != ""low"" # fuzzy matching job_starts_with_eng = RedisText(""job"") % ""eng*"" job_is_engineer = RedisText(""job"") == ""engineer"" job_is_not_engineer = RedisText(""job"") != ""engineer"" # numeric filtering age_is_18 = RedisNum(""age"") == 18 age_is_not_18 = RedisNum(""age"") != 18 age_is_greater_than_18 = RedisNum(""age"") > 18 age_is_less_than_18 = RedisNum(""age"") < 18 age_is_greater_than_or_equal_to_18 = RedisNum(""age"") >= 18 age_is_less_than_or_equal_to_18 = RedisNum(""age"") <= 18 ``` The `RedisFilter` class can be used to simplify the import of these filters as follows ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisFilter # same examples as above has_high_credit = RedisFilter.tag(""credit_score"") == ""high"" does_not_have_high_credit = RedisFilter.num(""age"") > 8 job_starts_with_eng = RedisFilter.text(""job"") % ""eng*"" ``` The following are examples of using hybrid filter for search ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisText is_engineer = RedisText(""job"") == ""engineer"" results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3, filter=is_engineer) print(""Job:"", results[0].metadata[""job""]) print(""Engineers in the dataset:"", len(results)) ``` ```text Job: engineer Engineers in the dataset: 2 ``` ```python # fuzzy match starts_with_doc = RedisText(""job"") % ""doc*"" results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", k=3, filter=starts_with_doc) for result in results: print(""Job:"", result.metadata[""job""]) print(""Jobs in dataset that start with \'doc\':"", len(results)) ``` ```text Job: doctor Job: doctor Jobs in dataset that start with \'doc\': 2 ``` ```python from langchain.vectorstores.redis import RedisNum is_over_18 = RedisNum(""age"") > 18 is_under_99 = RedisNum(""age"") < 99 age_range = is_over_18 & is_under_99 results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", filter=age_range) for result in results: print(""User:"", result.metadata[""user""], ""is"", result.metadata[""age""]) ``` ```text User: derrick is 45 User: nancy is 94 User: joe is 35 ``` ```python # make sure to use parenthesis around FilterExpressions # if initializing them while constructing them age_range = (RedisNum(""age"") > 18) & (RedisNum(""age"") < 99) results = rds.similarity_search(""foo"", filter=age_range) for result in results: print(""User:"", result.metadata[""user""], ""is"", result.metadata[""age""]) ``` ```text User: derrick is 45 User: nancy is 94 User: joe is 35 ``` ## Redis as Retriever\u200b Here we go over different options for using the vector store as a retriever. There are three different search methods we can use to do retrieval. By default, it will use semantic similarity. ```python query = ""foo"" results = rds.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=3, return_metadata=True) for result in results: print(""Content:"", result[0].page_content, "" --- Score: "", result[1]) ``` ```text Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 Content: foo --- Score: 0.0 ``` ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 4}) ``` ```python docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) docs ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:988ecca7574048e396756efc0e79aeca\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:009b1afeb4084cc6bdef858c7a99b48e\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:7087cee9be5b4eca93c30fbdd09a2731\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'}), Document(page_content=\'bar\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:01ef6caac12b42c28ad870aefe574253\', \'user\': \'tyler\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'100\'})] ``` There is also the `similarity_distance_threshold` retriever which allows the user to specify the vector distance ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever( search_type=""similarity_distance_threshold"", search_kwargs={""k"": 4, ""distance_threshold"": 0.1}, ) ``` ```python docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) docs ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:988ecca7574048e396756efc0e79aeca\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:009b1afeb4084cc6bdef858c7a99b48e\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:7087cee9be5b4eca93c30fbdd09a2731\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'})] ``` Lastly, the `similarity_score_threshold` allows the user to define the minimum score for similar documents ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever( search_type=""similarity_score_threshold"", search_kwargs={""score_threshold"": 0.9, ""k"": 10}, ) ``` ```python retriever.get_relevant_documents(""foo"") ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:988ecca7574048e396756efc0e79aeca\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:009b1afeb4084cc6bdef858c7a99b48e\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users_modified:7087cee9be5b4eca93c30fbdd09a2731\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'})] ``` ```python retriever = rds.as_retriever( search_type=""mmr"", search_kwargs={""fetch_k"": 20, ""k"": 4, ""lambda_mult"": 0.1} ) ``` ```python retriever.get_relevant_documents(""foo"") ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:8f6b673b390647809d510112cde01a27\', \'user\': \'john\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'18\'}), Document(page_content=\'bar\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:93521560735d42328b48c9c6f6418d6a\', \'user\': \'tyler\', \'job\': \'engineer\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'100\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:125ecd39d07845eabf1a699d44134a5b\', \'user\': \'nancy\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'high\', \'age\': \'94\'}), Document(page_content=\'foo\', metadata={\'id\': \'doc:users:d6200ab3764c466082fde3eaab972a2a\', \'user\': \'derrick\', \'job\': \'doctor\', \'credit_score\': \'low\', \'age\': \'45\'})] ``` # Delete keys To delete your entries you have to address them by their keys. ```python Redis.delete(keys, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"") ``` ```text True ``` ```python # delete the indices too Redis.drop_index( index_name=""users"", delete_documents=True, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"" ) Redis.drop_index( index_name=""users_modified"", delete_documents=True, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) ``` ```text True ``` ### Redis connection Url examples\u200b Valid Redis Url scheme are: 1. `redis://` - Connection to Redis standalone, unencrypted 2. `rediss://` - Connection to Redis standalone, with TLS encryption 3. `redis+sentinel://` - Connection to Redis server via Redis Sentinel, unencrypted 4. `rediss+sentinel://` - Connection to Redis server via Redis Sentinel, booth connections with TLS encryption More information about additional connection parameter can be found in the redis-py documentation at [ ```python # connection to redis standalone at localhost, db 0, no password redis_url = ""redis://localhost:6379"" # connection to host ""redis"" port 7379 with db 2 and password ""secret"" (old style authentication scheme without username / pre 6.x) redis_url = ""redis://:secret@redis:7379/2"" # connection to host redis on default port with user ""joe"", pass ""secret"" using redis version 6+ ACLs redis_url = ""redis://joe:secret@redis/0"" # connection to sentinel at localhost with default group mymaster and db 0, no password redis_url = ""redis+sentinel://localhost:26379"" # connection to sentinel at host redis with default port 26379 and user ""joe"" with password ""secret"" with default group mymaster and db 0 redis_url = ""redis+sentinel://joe:secret@redis"" # connection to sentinel, no auth with sentinel monitoring group ""zone-1"" and database 2 redis_url = ""redis+sentinel://redis:26379/zone-1/2"" # connection to redis standalone at localhost, db 0, no password but with TLS support redis_url = ""rediss://localhost:6379"" # connection to redis sentinel at localhost and default port, db 0, no password # but with TLS support for booth Sentinel and Redis server redis_url = ""rediss+sentinel://localhost"" ``` -

The `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` lets a user split `Markdown` files files based on specified headers. This results in chunks that retain the header(s) that it came from in the metadata. This works nicely w/ `SelfQueryRetriever`. First, tell the retriever about our splits. Then, query based on the doc structure (e.g., ""summarize the doc introduction""). Chunks only from that section of the Document will be filtered and used in chat / Q+A. Let\'s test this out on an [example Notion page]( First, I download the page to Markdown as explained [here]( ```python # Load Notion page as a markdownfile file from langchain.document_loaders import NotionDirectoryLoader path = ""../Notion_DB/"" loader = NotionDirectoryLoader(path) docs = loader.load() md_file = docs[0].page_content ``` ```python # Let\'s create groups based on the section headers in our page from langchain.text_splitter import MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter headers_to_split_on = [ (""###"", ""Section""), ] markdown_splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(headers_to_split_on=headers_to_split_on) md_header_splits = markdown_splitter.split_text(md_file) ``` Now, perform text splitting on the header grouped documents. ```python # Define our text splitter from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter chunk_size = 500 chunk_overlap = 0 text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=chunk_size, chunk_overlap=chunk_overlap ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(md_header_splits) ``` This sets us up well do perform metadata filtering based on the document structure. Let\'s bring this all together by building a vectorstore first. ```bash pip install chromadb ``` ```python # Build vectorstore and keep the metadata from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Let\'s create a `SelfQueryRetriever` that can filter based upon metadata we defined. ```python # Create retriever from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever # Define our metadata metadata_field_info = [ AttributeInfo( name=""Section"", description=""Part of the document that the text comes from"", type=""string or list[string]"", ), ] document_content_description = ""Major sections of the document"" # Define self query retriever llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm( llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True ) ``` We can see that we can query _only for texts_ in the `Introduction` of the document! ```python # Test retriever.get_relevant_documents(""Summarize the Introduction section of the document"") ``` ```text query=\'Introduction\' filter=Comparison(comparator=, attribute=\'Section\', value=\'Introduction\') limit=None [Document(page_content=\'![Untitled](Auto-Evaluation%20of%20Metadata%20Filtering%2018502448c85240828f33716740f9574b/Untitled.png)\', metadata={\'Section\': \'Introduction\'}), Document(page_content=\'Q+A systems often use a two-step approach: retrieve relevant text chunks and then synthesize them into an answer.

In the notebook, we\'ll demo the `SelfQueryRetriever` wrapped around a `Redis` vector store. ## Creating a Redis vector store First we\'ll want to create a Redis vector store and seed it with some data. We\'ve created a small demo set of documents that contain summaries of movies. **Note:** The self-query retriever requires you to have `lark` installed (`pip install lark`) along with integration-specific requirements. ```python # !pip install redis redisvl openai tiktoken lark ``` We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import Document from langchain.vectorstores import Redis embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ```python docs = [ Document( page_content=""A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose"", metadata={ ""year"": 1993, ""rating"": 7.7, ""director"": ""Steven Spielberg"", ""genre"": ""science fiction"", }, ), Document( page_content=""Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ..."", metadata={ ""year"": 2010, ""director"": ""Christopher Nolan"", ""genre"": ""science fiction"", ""rating"": 8.2, }, ), Document( page_content=""A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea"", metadata={ ""year"": 2006, ""director"": ""Satoshi Kon"", ""genre"": ""science fiction"", ""rating"": 8.6, }, ), Document( page_content=""A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them"", metadata={ ""year"": 2019, ""director"": ""Greta Gerwig"", ""genre"": ""drama"", ""rating"": 8.3, }, ), Document( page_content=""Toys come alive and have a blast doing so"", metadata={ ""year"": 1995, ""director"": ""John Lasseter"", ""genre"": ""animated"", ""rating"": 9.1, }, ), Document( page_content=""Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone"", metadata={ ""year"": 1979, ""rating"": 9.9, ""director"": ""Andrei Tarkovsky"", ""genre"": ""science fiction"", }, ), ] ``` ```python index_schema = { ""tag"": [{""name"": ""genre""}], ""text"": [{""name"": ""director""}], ""numeric"": [{""name"": ""year""}, {""name"": ""rating""}], } vectorstore = Redis.from_documents( docs, embeddings, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", index_name=""movie_reviews"", index_schema=index_schema, ) ``` ```text `index_schema` does not match generated metadata schema.

Parameters prompts – List of PromptValues. A PromptValue is an object that can be converted to match the format of any language model (string for pure text generation models and BaseMessages for chat models). stop – Stop words to use when generating.

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved. I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now. It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue it\'s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables. My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\'ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use! I didn\'t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+.

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered ""controversial"" I really had to see this for myself.The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America.

It doesn\\\'t matter what one\\\'s political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn\\\'t true. I\\\'ve seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don\\\'t exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we\\\'re treated to the site of Vincent Gallo\\\'s throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) ""double-standard"" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won\\\'t see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica.

To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York\\\'s portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He\\\'s small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS\\\' American Masters: Finding Lucy.

Certainly couldn\\\'t be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It\\\'s the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot\\x97 TOO much fun, nobody is getting any actual work done, and that almost always makes for a movie that\\\'s no fun to watch.Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character\\\'s status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-guys-I\\\'m-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat\\\'s-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple\\\'s respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich\\\'s daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on \\\'love\\\' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself, ostensibly.) Everybody looks great, but so what? It\\\'s a movie and we can expect that much, if that\\\'s what you\\\'re looking for you\\\'d be better off picking up a copy of Vogue.Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie\\\'s title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20\\\'s may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. ""They All Laughed"" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn\\\'t prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there\\\'s no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten\\\'s scenes.

LangChain provides a callbacks system that allows you to hook into the various stages of your LLM application. This is useful for logging, monitoring, streaming, and other tasks. You can subscribe to these events by using the `callbacks` argument available throughout the API. This argument is list of handler objects, which are expected to implement one or more of the methods described below in more detail. ## Callback handlers `CallbackHandlers` are objects that implement the `CallbackHandler` interface, which has a method for each event that can be subscribed to. The `CallbackManager` will call the appropriate method on each handler when the event is triggered. ```python class BaseCallbackHandler: """"""Base callback handler that can be used to handle callbacks from langchain."""""" def on_llm_start( self, serialized: Dict[str, Any], prompts: List[str], **kwargs: Any ) -> Any: """"""Run when LLM starts running."""""" def on_chat_model_start( self, serialized: Dict[str, Any], messages: List[List[BaseMessage]], **kwargs: Any ) -> Any: """"""Run when Chat Model starts running."""""" def on_llm_new_token(self, token: str, **kwargs: Any) -> Any: """"""Run on new LLM token. Only available when streaming is enabled."""""" def on_llm_end(self, response: LLMResult, **kwargs: Any) -> Any: """"""Run when LLM ends running."""""" def on_llm_error( self, error: Union[Exception, KeyboardInterrupt], **kwargs: Any ) -> Any: """"""Run when LLM errors."""""" def on_chain_start( self, serialized: Dict[str, Any], inputs: Dict[str, Any], **kwargs: Any ) -> Any: """"""Run when chain starts running."""""" def on_chain_end(self, outputs: Dict[str, Any], **kwargs: Any) -> Any: """"""Run when chain ends running."""""" def on_chain_error( self, error: Union[Exception, KeyboardInterrupt], **kwargs: Any ) -> Any: """"""Run when chain errors."""""" def on_tool_start( self, serialized: Dict[str, Any], input_str: str, **kwargs: Any ) -> Any: """"""Run when tool starts running."""""" def on_tool_end(self, output: str, **kwargs: Any) -> Any: """"""Run when tool ends running."""""" def on_tool_error( self, error: Union[Exception, KeyboardInterrupt], **kwargs: Any ) -> Any: """"""Run when tool errors."""""" def on_text(self, text: str, **kwargs: Any) -> Any: """"""Run on arbitrary text."""""" def on_agent_action(self, action: AgentAction, **kwargs: Any) -> Any: """"""Run on agent action."""""" def on_agent_finish(self, finish: AgentFinish, **kwargs: Any) -> Any: """"""Run on agent end."""""" ``` ## Get started LangChain provides a few built-in handlers that you can use to get started. These are available in the `langchain/callbacks` module. The most basic handler is the `StdOutCallbackHandler`, which simply logs all events to `stdout`. **Note**: when the `verbose` flag on the object is set to true, the `StdOutCallbackHandler` will be invoked even without being explicitly passed in. ```python from langchain.callbacks import StdOutCallbackHandler from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate handler = StdOutCallbackHandler() llm = OpenAI() prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""1 + {number} = "") # Constructor callback: First, let\'s explicitly set the StdOutCallbackHandler when initializing our chain chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, callbacks=[handler]) chain.run(number=2) # Use verbose flag: Then, let\'s use the `verbose` flag to achieve the same result chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True) chain.run(number=2) # Request callbacks: Finally, let\'s use the request `callbacks` to achieve the same result chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) chain.run(number=2, callbacks=[handler]) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: 1 + 2 = > Finished chain. > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: 1 + 2 = > Finished chain. > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: 1 + 2 = > Finished chain. \'\\n\\n3\' ``` ## Where to pass in callbacks The `callbacks` argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) in two different places: - **Constructor callbacks**: defined in the constructor, e.g. `LLMChain(callbacks=[handler], tags=[\'a-tag\'])`, which will be used for all calls made on that object, and will be scoped to that object only, e.g. if you pass a handler to the `LLMChain` constructor, it will not be used by the Model attached to that chain. - **Request callbacks**: defined in the `run()`/`apply()` methods used for issuing a request, e.g. `chain.run(input, callbacks=[handler])`, which will be used for that specific request only, and all sub-requests that it contains (e.g. a call to an LLMChain triggers a call to a Model, which uses the same handler passed in the `call()` method). The `verbose` argument is available on most objects throughout the API (Chains, Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) as a constructor argument, e.g. `LLMChain(verbose=True)`, and it is equivalent to passing a `ConsoleCallbackHandler` to the `callbacks` argument of that object and all child objects. This is useful for debugging, as it will log all events to the console. ### When do you want to use each of these? - Constructor callbacks are most useful for use cases such as logging, monitoring, etc., which are _not specific to a single request_, but rather to the entire chain. For example, if you want to log all the requests made to an `LLMChain`, you would pass a handler to the constructor. - Request callbacks are most useful for use cases such as streaming, where you want to stream the output of a single request to a specific websocket connection, or other similar use cases. For example, if you want to stream the output of a single request to a websocket, you would pass a handler to the `call()` method - [Callback handlers](#callback-handlers) - [Get started](#get-started) - [Where to pass in callbacks](#where-to-pass-in-callbacks)- [When do you want to use each of these?](#when-do-you-want-to-use-each-of-these)', ""Deployment | Deployment In today's fast-paced technological landscape, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly expanding. As a result, it is crucial for developers to understand how to effectively deploy these models in production environments. LLM interfaces typically fall into two categories: - **Case 1: Utilizing External LLM Providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)** In this scenario, most of the computational burden is handled by the LLM providers, while LangChain simplifies the implementation of business logic around these services. This approach includes features such as prompt templating, chat message generation, caching, vector embedding database creation, preprocessing, etc. - **Case 2: Self-hosted Open-Source Models** Alternatively, developers can opt to use smaller, yet comparably capable, self-hosted open-source LLM models. This approach can significantly decrease costs, latency, and privacy concerns associated with transferring data to external LLM providers. Regardless of the framework that forms the backbone of your product, deploying LLM applications comes with its own set of challenges. It's vital to understand the trade-offs and key considerations when evaluating serving frameworks. ## Outline This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the requirements for deploying LLMs in a production setting, focusing on: - **Designing a Robust LLM Application Service** - **Maintaining Cost-Efficiency** - **Ensuring Rapid Iteration** Understanding these components is crucial when assessing serving systems. LangChain integrates with several open-source projects designed to tackle these issues, providing a robust framework for productionizing your LLM applications. Some notable frameworks include: - [Ray Serve](/docs/ecosystem/integrations/ray_serve) - [BentoML]( - [OpenLLM](/docs/ecosystem/integrations/openllm) - [Modal](/docs/ecosystem/integrations/modal) - [Jina](/docs/ecosystem/integrations/jina#deployment) These links will provide further information on each ecosystem, assisting you in finding the best fit for your LLM deployment needs. ## Designing a Robust LLM Application Service When deploying an LLM service in production, it's imperative to provide a seamless user experience free from outages. Achieving 24/7 service availability involves creating and maintaining several sub-systems surrounding your application. ### Monitoring Monitoring forms an integral part of any system running in a production environment. In the context of LLMs, it is essential to monitor both performance and quality metrics. **Performance Metrics:** These metrics provide insights into the efficiency and capacity of your model. Here are some key examples: - Query per second (QPS): This measures the number of queries your model processes in a second, offering insights into its utilization. - Latency: This metric quantifies the delay from when your client sends a request to when they receive a response. - Tokens Per Second (TPS): This represents the number of tokens your model can generate in a second. **Quality Metrics:** These metrics are typically customized according to the business use-case. For instance, how does the output of your system compare to a baseline, such as a previous version? Although these metrics can be calculated offline, you need to log the necessary data to use them later. ### Fault tolerance Your application may encounter errors such as exceptions in your model inference or business logic code, causing failures and disrupting traffic. Other potential issues could arise from the machine running your application, such as unexpected hardware breakdowns or loss of spot-instances during high-demand periods. One way to mitigate these risks is by increasing redundancy through replica scaling and implementing recovery mechanisms for failed replicas. However, model replicas aren't the only potential points of failure. It's essential to build resilience against various failures that could occur at any point in your stack. ### Zero down time upgrade System upgrades are often necessary but can result in service disruptions if not handled correctly. One way to prevent downtime during upgrades is by implementing a smooth transition process from the old version to the new one. Ideally, the new version of your LLM service is deployed, and traffic gradually shifts from the old to the new version, maintaining a constant QPS throughout the process. ### Load balancing Load balancing, in simple terms, is a technique to distribute work evenly across multiple computers, servers, or other resources to optimize the utilization of the system, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource. Think of it as a traffic officer directing cars (requests) to different roads (servers) so that no single road becomes too congested. There are several strategies for load balancing. For example, one common method is the _Round Robin_ strategy, where each request is sent to the next server in line, cycling back to the first when all servers have received a request. This works well when all servers are equally capable. However, if some servers are more powerful than others, you might use a _Weighted Round Robin_ or _Least Connections_ strategy, where more requests are sent to the more powerful servers, or to those currently handling the fewest active requests. Let's imagine you're running a LLM chain. If your application becomes popular, you could have hundreds or even thousands of users asking questions at the same time. If one server gets too busy (high load), the load balancer would direct new requests to another server that is less busy. This way, all your users get a timely response and the system remains stable. ## Maintaining Cost-Efficiency and Scalability Deploying LLM services can be costly, especially when you're handling a large volume of user interactions. Charges by LLM providers are usually based on tokens used, making a chat system inference on these models potentially expensive. However, several strategies can help manage these costs without compromising the quality of the service. ### Self-hosting models Several smaller and open-source LLMs are emerging to tackle the issue of reliance on LLM providers. Self-hosting allows you to maintain similar quality to LLM provider models while managing costs. The challenge lies in building a reliable, high-performing LLM serving system on your own machines. ### Resource Management and Auto-Scaling Computational logic within your application requires precise resource allocation. For instance, if part of your traffic is served by an OpenAI endpoint and another part by a self-hosted model, it's crucial to allocate suitable resources for each. Auto-scalingadjusting resource allocation based on trafficcan significantly impact the cost of running your application. This strategy requires a balance between cost and responsiveness, ensuring neither resource over-provisioning nor compromised application responsiveness. ### Utilizing Spot Instances On platforms like AWS, spot instances offer substantial cost savings, typically priced at about a third of on-demand instances. The trade-off is a higher crash rate, necessitating a robust fault-tolerance mechanism for effective use. ### Independent Scaling When self-hosting your models, you should consider independent scaling. For example, if you have two translation models, one fine-tuned for French and another for Spanish, incoming requests might necessitate different scaling requirements for each. ### Batching requests In the context of Large Language Models, batching requests can enhance efficiency by better utilizing your GPU resources. GPUs are inherently parallel processors, designed to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. If you send individual requests to the model, the GPU might not be fully utilized as it's only working on a single task at a time. On the other hand, by batching requests together, you're allowing the GPU to work on multiple tasks at once, maximizing its utilization and improving inference speed. This not only leads to cost savings but can also improve the overall latency of your LLM service. In summary, managing costs while scaling your LLM services requires a strategic approach. Utilizing self-hosting models, managing resources effectively, employing auto-scaling, using spot instances, independently scaling models, and batching requests are key strategies to consider. Open-source libraries such as Ray Serve and BentoML are designed to deal with these complexities. ## Ensuring Rapid Iteration The LLM landscape is evolving at an unprecedented pace, with new libraries and model architectures being introduced constantly. Consequently, it's crucial to avoid tying yourself to a solution specific to one particular framework. This is especially relevant in serving, where changes to your infrastructure can be time-consuming, expensive, and risky. Strive for infrastructure that is not locked into any specific machine learning library or framework, but instead offers a general-purpose, scalable serving layer. Here are some aspects where flexibility plays a key role: ### Model composition Deploying systems like LangChain demands the ability to piece together different models and connect them via logic. Take the example of building a natural language input SQL query engine. Querying an LLM and obtaining the SQL command is only part of the system. You need to extract metadata from the connected database, construct a prompt for the LLM, run the SQL query on an engine, collect and feed back the response to the LLM as the query runs, and present the results to the user. This demonstrates the need to seamlessly integrate various complex components built in Python into a dynamic chain of logical blocks that can be served together. ## Cloud providers Many hosted solutions are restricted to a single cloud provider, which can limit your options in today's multi-cloud world. Depending on where your other infrastructure components are built, you might prefer to stick with your chosen cloud provider. ## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Rapid iteration also involves the ability to recreate your infrastructure quickly and reliably. This is where Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or Kubernetes YAML files come into play. They allow you to define your infrastructure in code files, which can be version controlled and quickly deployed, enabling faster and more reliable iterations. ## CI/CD In a fast-paced environment, implementing CI/CD pipelines can significantly speed up the iteration process. They help automate the testing and deployment of your LLM applications, reducing the risk of errors and enabling faster feedback and iteration. - [Outline](#outline) - [Designing a Robust LLM Application Service](#designing-a-robust-llm-application-service)- [Monitoring](#monitoring) - [Fault tolerance](#fault-tolerance) - [Zero down time upgrade](#zero-down-time-upgrade) - [Load balancing](#load-balancing) - [Maintaining Cost-Efficiency and Scalability](#maintaining-cost-efficiency-and-scalability)- [Self-hosting models](#self-hosting-models) - [Resource Management and Auto-Scaling](#resource-management-and-auto-scaling) - [Utilizing Spot Instances](#utilizing-spot-instances) - [Independent Scaling](#independent-scaling) - [Batching requests](#batching-requests) - [Ensuring Rapid Iteration](#ensuring-rapid-iteration)- [Model composition](#model-composition) - [Cloud providers](#cloud-providers) - [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](#infrastructure-as-code-iac) - [CI/CD](#cicd)""]",Set `total_retries` and `request_timeout_seconds` in the AlephAlpha API call parameters.,"To limit the maximum number of concurrent requests for batch calls in LangChain, you can call the `.batch()` method and configure the 'max_concurrency' paramater within the runnable config.

It provides comprehensive features for monitoring, managing models, and improving the performance of your AI applications. ## LLMOps for Langchain Portkey brings production readiness to Langchain. With Portkey, you can - view detailed **metrics & logs** for all requests, - enable **semantic cache** to reduce latency & costs, - implement automatic **retries & fallbacks** for failed requests, - add **custom tags** to requests for better tracking and analysis and [more]( ### Using Portkey with Langchain Using Portkey is as simple as just choosing which Portkey features you want, enabling them via `headers=Portkey.Config` and passing it in your LLM calls. To start, get your Portkey API key by [signing up here]( (Click the profile icon on the top left, then click on ""Copy API Key"") For OpenAI, a simple integration with logging feature would look like this: ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import Portkey # Add the Portkey API Key from your account headers = Portkey.Config( api_key = """" ) llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, headers=headers) llm.predict(""What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"") ``` Your logs will be captured on your [Portkey dashboard]( A common Portkey X Langchain use case is to **trace a chain or an agent** and view all the LLM calls originating from that request. ### Tracing Chains & Agents ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import Portkey # Add the Portkey API Key from your account headers = Portkey.Config( api_key = """", trace_id = ""fef659"" ) llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, headers=headers) tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm) agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True) # Let\'s test it out! agent.run(""What was the high temperature in SF yesterday in Fahrenheit? What is that number raised to the .023 power?"") ``` **You can see the requests\' logs along with the trace id on Portkey dashboard:** ![](/img/portkey-dashboard.gif)![](/img/portkey-tracing.png)## Advanced Features 1. **Logging:** Log all your LLM requests automatically by sending them through Portkey. Each request log contains `timestamp`, `model name`, `total cost`, `request time`, `request json`, `response json`, and additional Portkey features. 2. **Tracing:** Trace id can be passed along with each request and is visibe on the logs on Portkey dashboard. You can also set a **distinct trace id** for each request. You can [append user feedback]( to a trace id as well. 3. **Caching:** Respond to previously served customers queries from cache instead of sending them again to OpenAI. Match exact strings OR semantically similar strings. Cache can save costs and reduce latencies by 20x. 4. **Retries:** Automatically reprocess any unsuccessful API requests **upto 5** times. Uses an **exponential backoff** strategy, which spaces out retry attempts to prevent network overload. 5. **Tagging:** Track and audit each user interaction in high detail with predefined tags. | Feature | Config Key | Value (Type) | Required/Optional | | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | | API Key | api_key | API Key (string) | Required | | Tracing Requests | trace_id | Customstring | Optional | | Automatic Retries | retry_count | integer[1,2,3,4,5] | Optional | | Enabling Cache | cache | simpleORsemantic | Optional | | Cache Force Refresh | cache_force_refresh | True | Optional | | Set Cache Expiry | cache_age | integer(in seconds) | Optional | | Add User | user | string | Optional | | Add Organisation | organisation | string | Optional | | Add Environment | environment | string | Optional | | Add Prompt (version/id/string) | prompt | string | Optional | ## Enabling all Portkey Features: ```py headers = Portkey.Config( # Mandatory api_key="""", # Cache Options cache=""semantic"", cache_force_refresh=""True"", cache_age=1729, # Advanced retry_count=5, trace_id=""langchain_agent"", # Metadata environment=""production"", user=""john"", organisation=""acme"", prompt=""Frost"" ) ``` For detailed information on each feature and how to use it, [please refer to the Portkey docs]( If you have any questions or need further assistance, [reach out to us on Twitter.]( - [LLMOps for Langchain](#llmops-for-langchain)- [Using Portkey with Langchain](#using-portkey-with-langchain) - [Tracing Chains & Agents](#tracing-chains--agents) - [Advanced Features](#advanced-features) - [Enabling all Portkey Features:](#enabling-all-portkey-features)', 'LLM Caching integrations | LLM Caching integrations This notebook covers how to cache results of individual LLM calls using different caches. ```python from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache from langchain.llms import OpenAI # To make the caching really obvious, lets use a slower model. llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", n=2, best_of=2) ``` ## In Memory Cache ```python from langchain.cache import InMemoryCache set_llm_cache(InMemoryCache()) ``` ```python # The first time, it is not yet in cache, so it should take longer llm(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 52.2 ms, sys: 15.2 ms, total: 67.4 ms Wall time: 1.19 s ""\\n\\nWhy couldn\'t the bicycle stand up by itself?

Requires momento to use, uncomment below to install: ```python # !pip install momento ``` You\'ll need to get a Momento auth token to use this class. This can either be passed in to a momento.CacheClient if you\'d like to instantiate that directly, as a named parameter `auth_token` to `MomentoChatMessageHistory.from_client_params`, or can just be set as an environment variable `MOMENTO_AUTH_TOKEN`. ```python from datetime import timedelta from langchain.cache import MomentoCache cache_name = ""langchain"" ttl = timedelta(days=1) set_llm_cache(MomentoCache.from_client_params(cache_name, ttl)) ``` ```python # The first time, it is not yet in cache, so it should take longer llm(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 40.7 ms, sys: 16.5 ms, total: 57.2 ms Wall time: 1.73 s \'\\n\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\n\\nTo get to the other side!\' ``` ```python # The second time it is, so it goes faster # When run in the same region as the cache, latencies are single digit ms llm(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 3.16 ms, sys: 2.98 ms, total: 6.14 ms Wall time: 57.9 ms \'\\n\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\n\\nTo get to the other side!\' ``` ## SQLAlchemy Cache You can use `SQLAlchemyCache` to cache with any SQL database supported by `SQLAlchemy`. ```python # from langchain.cache import SQLAlchemyCache # from sqlalchemy import create_engine # engine = create_engine(""postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"") # set_llm_cache(SQLAlchemyCache(engine)) ``` ### Custom SQLAlchemy Schemas ```python # You can define your own declarative SQLAlchemyCache child class to customize the schema used for caching. For example, to support high-speed fulltext prompt indexing with Postgres, use: from langchain.cache import SQLAlchemyCache from sqlalchemy import Column, Computed, Index, Integer, Sequence, String, create_engine from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base from sqlalchemy_utils import TSVectorType Base = declarative_base() class FulltextLLMCache(Base): # type: ignore """"""Postgres table for fulltext-indexed LLM Cache"""""" __tablename__ = ""llm_cache_fulltext"" id = Column(Integer, Sequence(""cache_id""), primary_key=True) prompt = Column(String, nullable=False) llm = Column(String, nullable=False) idx = Column(Integer) response = Column(String) prompt_tsv = Column( TSVectorType(), Computed(""to_tsvector(\'english\', llm || \' \' || prompt)"", persisted=True), ) __table_args__ = ( Index(""idx_fulltext_prompt_tsv"", prompt_tsv, postgresql_using=""gin""), ) engine = create_engine(""postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"") set_llm_cache(SQLAlchemyCache(engine, FulltextLLMCache)) ``` ## Cassandra caches You can use Cassandra / Astra DB for caching LLM responses, choosing from the exact-match `CassandraCache` or the (vector-similarity-based) `CassandraSemanticCache`. Let\'s see both in action in the following cells. #### Connect to the DB First you need to establish a `Session` to the DB and to specify a _keyspace_ for the cache table(s). The following gets you started with an Astra DB instance (see e.g. [here]( for more backends and connection options). ```python import getpass keyspace = input(""\\nKeyspace name? "") ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN = getpass.getpass(\'\\nAstra DB Token (""AstraCS:..."") \') ASTRA_DB_SECURE_BUNDLE_PATH = input(""Full path to your Secure Connect Bundle? "") ``` ```text Keyspace name? my_keyspace Astra DB Token (""AstraCS:..."") Full path to your Secure Connect Bundle? /path/to/secure-connect-databasename.zip ``` ```python from cassandra.auth import PlainTextAuthProvider from cassandra.cluster import Cluster cluster = Cluster( cloud={ ""secure_connect_bundle"": ASTRA_DB_SECURE_BUNDLE_PATH, }, auth_provider=PlainTextAuthProvider(""token"", ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN), ) session = cluster.connect() ``` ### Exact cache This will avoid invoking the LLM when the supplied prompt is _exactly_ the same as one encountered already: ```python from langchain.cache import CassandraCache from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache set_llm_cache(CassandraCache(session=session, keyspace=keyspace)) ``` ```python print(llm(""Why is the Moon always showing the same side?"")) ``` ```text The Moon always shows the same side because it is tidally locked to Earth. CPU times: user 41.7 ms, sys: 153 µs, total: 41.8 ms Wall time: 1.96 s ``` ```python print(llm(""Why is the Moon always showing the same side?"")) ``` ```text The Moon always shows the same side because it is tidally locked to Earth. CPU times: user 4.09 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 4.09 ms Wall time: 119 ms ``` ### Semantic cache\u200b This cache will do a semantic similarity search and return a hit if it finds a cached entry that is similar enough, For this, you need to provide an `Embeddings` instance of your choice. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ```python from langchain.cache import CassandraSemanticCache set_llm_cache( CassandraSemanticCache( session=session, keyspace=keyspace, embedding=embedding, table_name=""cass_sem_cache"", ) ) ``` ```python print(llm(""Why is the Moon always showing the same side?"")) ``` ```text The Moon always shows the same side because it is tidally locked with Earth. This means that the same side of the Moon always faces Earth. CPU times: user 21.3 ms, sys: 177 µs, total: 21.4 ms Wall time: 3.09 s ``` ```python print(llm(""How come we always see one face of the moon?"")) ``` ```text The Moon always shows the same side because it is tidally locked with Earth. This means that the same side of the Moon always faces Earth. CPU times: user 10.9 ms, sys: 17 µs, total: 10.9 ms Wall time: 461 ms ``` ## Optional Caching\u200b You can also turn off caching for specific LLMs should you choose. In the example below, even though global caching is enabled, we turn it off for a specific LLM ```python llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", n=2, best_of=2, cache=False) ``` ```python llm(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 5.8 ms, sys: 2.71 ms, total: 8.51 ms Wall time: 745 ms \'\\n\\nWhy did the chicken cross the road?\\n\\nTo get to the other side!\' ``` ```python llm(""Tell me a joke"") ``` ```text CPU times: user 4.91 ms, sys: 2.64 ms, total: 7.55 ms Wall time: 623 ms \'\\n\\nTwo guys stole a calendar. They got six months each.\' ``` ## Optional Caching in Chains\u200b You can also turn off caching for particular nodes in chains. Note that because of certain interfaces, its often easier to construct the chain first, and then edit the LLM afterwards. As an example, we will load a summarizer map-reduce chain. We will cache results for the map-step, but then not freeze it for the combine step. ```python llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"") no_cache_llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", cache=False) ``` ```python from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter() ``` ```python with open(""../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") as f: state_of_the_union = f.read() texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union) ``` ```python from langchain.docstore.document import Document docs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts[:3]] from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain ``` ```python chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"", reduce_llm=no_cache_llm) ``` ```python chain.run(docs) ``` ```text CPU times: user 452 ms, sys: 60.3 ms, total: 512 ms Wall time: 5.09 s \'\\n\\nPresident Biden is discussing the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will create jobs and help Americans.

American forces are being mobilized to protect NATO countries in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting back, but the next few weeks will be hard for them. Putin will pay a high price for his actions in the long run. Americans should not be alarmed, as the United States is taking action to protect its interests and allies.\' ``` When we run it again, we see that it runs substantially faster but the final answer is different.

However, these requests are not chained when you want to analyse them. With [Portkey](/docs/ecosystem/integrations/portkey), all the embeddings, completion, and other requests from a single user request will get logged and traced to a common ID, enabling you to gain full visibility of user interactions. This notebook serves as a step-by-step guide on how to log, trace, and monitor Langchain LLM calls using `Portkey` in your Langchain app. First, let\'s import Portkey, OpenAI, and Agent tools ```python import os from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import Portkey ``` Paste your OpenAI API key below. [(You can find it here)]( ```python os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """" ``` ## Get Portkey API Key 1. Sign up for [Portkey here]( 2.

Most users will already have done that before interacting with LangChain so this example will use the data in an existing app to perform searches. Check out our [API docs]( and [UI docs]( The Clarifai Application can then be used for semantic search to find relevant documents. ```python USER_ID = ""USERNAME_ID"" APP_ID = ""APPLICATION_ID"" NUMBER_OF_DOCS = 4 ``` ```python clarifai_vector_db = Clarifai( user_id=USER_ID, app_id=APP_ID, pat=CLARIFAI_PAT, number_of_docs=NUMBER_OF_DOCS, ) ``` ```python docs = clarifai_vector_db.similarity_search(""Texts related to criminals and violence"") docs ``` - [From Texts](#from-texts) - [From Documents](#from-documents) - [From existing App](#from-existing-app)', 'langchain.vectorstores.redis.base.Redis LangChain 0.0.337 API Experimental Python Docs Toggle Menu PrevUp Next LangChain 0.0.337 langchain.vectorstores.redis.base.Redis langchain.vectorstores.redis.base.Redis class langchain.vectorstores.redis.base.Redis(redis_url: str, index_name: str, embedding: Embeddings, index_schema: Optional[Union[Dict[str, str], str, PathLike]] = None, vector_schema: Optional[Dict[str, Union[int, str]]] = None, relevance_score_fn: Optional[Callable[[float], float]] = None, key_prefix: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs: Any)[source] Redis vector database. To use, you should have the redis python package installed and have a running Redis Enterprise or Redis-Stack server For production use cases, it is recommended to use Redis Enterprise as the scaling, performance, stability and availability is much better than Redis-Stack. For testing and prototyping, however, this is not required. Redis-Stack is available as a docker container the full vector search API available. # to run redis stack in docker locally docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest Once running, you can connect to the redis server with the following url schemas: - redis://: # simple connection - redis://:@: # connection with authentication - rediss://: # connection with SSL - rediss://:@: # connection with SSL and auth Examples: The following examples show various ways to use the Redis VectorStore with LangChain. For all the following examples assume we have the following imports: from langchain.vectorstores import Redis from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings Initialize, create index, and load Documentsfrom langchain.vectorstores import Redis from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings rds = Redis.from_documents( documents, # a list of Document objects from loaders or created embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize, create index, and load Documents with metadatards = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize, create index, and load Documents with metadata and return keys rds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) For use cases where the index needs to stay alive, you can initialize with an index name such that it\'s easier to reference later rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_name=""my-index"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize and connect to an existing index (from above) rds = Redis.from_existing_index( embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_name=""my-index"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Advanced examples: Custom vector schema can be supplied to change the way that Redis creates the underlying vector schema. This is useful for production use cases where you want to optimize the vector schema for your use case. ex. using HNSW instead of FLAT (knn) which is the default vector_schema = { ""algorithm"": ""HNSW"" } rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object vector_schema=vector_schema, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Custom index schema can be supplied to change the way that the metadata is indexed. This is useful for you would like to use the hybrid querying (filtering) capability of Redis. By default, this implementation will automatically generate the index schema according to the following rules: All strings are indexed as text fields All numbers are indexed as numeric fields All lists of strings are indexed as tag fields (joined bylangchain.vectorstores.redis.constants.REDIS_TAG_SEPARATOR) All None values are not indexed but still stored in Redis these arenot retrievable through the interface here, but the raw Redis client can be used to retrieve them. All other types are not indexed To override these rules, you can pass in a custom index schema like the following tag: - name: credit_score text: - name: user - name: job Typically, the credit_score field would be a text field since it\'s a string, however, we can override this behavior by specifying the field type as shown with the yaml config (can also be a dictionary) above and the code below. rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_schema=""path/to/index_schema.yaml"", # can also be a dictionary redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) When connecting to an existing index where a custom schema has been applied, it\'s important to pass in the same schema to the from_existing_index method. Otherwise, the schema for newly added samples will be incorrect and metadata will not be returned. Initialize with necessary components.

Distance strategy to use when searching the index. Defaults to COSINE. Can be one of COSINE, EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE, or DOT_PRODUCT. If you want to use a cloud hosted Elasticsearch instance, you can pass in the cloud_id argument instead of the es_url argument.

Show this page source', 'Returning Structured Output | Returning Structured Output This notebook covers how to have an agent return a structured output. By default, most of the agents return a single string. It can often be useful to have an agent return something with more structure. A good example of this is an agent tasked with doing question-answering over some sources. Let\'s say we want the agent to respond not only with the answer, but also a list of the sources used. We then want our output to roughly follow the schema below: ```python class Response(BaseModel): """"""Final response to the question being asked"""""" answer: str = Field(description = ""The final answer to respond to the user"") sources: List[int] = Field(description=""List of page chunks that contain answer to the question. Only include a page chunk if it contains relevant information"") ``` In this notebook we will go over an agent that has a retriever tool and responds in the correct format. ## Create the Retriever In this section we will do some setup work to create our retriever over some mock data containing the ""State of the Union"" address. Importantly, we will add a ""page_chunk"" tag to the metadata of each document. This is just some fake data intended to simulate a source field. In practice, this would more likely be the URL or path of a document. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python # Load in document to retrieve over loader = TextLoader(""../../state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() # Split document into chunks text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) # Here is where we add in the fake source information for i, doc in enumerate(texts): doc.metadata[""page_chunk""] = i # Create our retriever embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings, collection_name=""state-of-union"") retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() ``` ## Create the tools We will now create the tools we want to give to the agent. In this case, it is just one - a tool that wraps our retriever. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.conversational_retrieval.tool import ( create_retriever_tool, ) retriever_tool = create_retriever_tool( retriever, ""state-of-union-retriever"", ""Query a retriever to get information about state of the union address"", ) ``` ## Create response schema Here is where we will define the response schema. In this case, we want the final answer to have two fields: one for the `answer`, and then another that is a list of `sources` ```python from typing import List from langchain.utils.openai_functions import convert_pydantic_to_openai_function from pydantic import BaseModel, Field class Response(BaseModel): """"""Final response to the question being asked"""""" answer: str = Field(description=""The final answer to respond to the user"") sources: List[int] = Field( description=""List of page chunks that contain answer to the question. Only include a page chunk if it contains relevant information"" ) ``` ## Create the custom parsing logic We now create some custom parsing logic. How this works is that we will pass the `Response` schema to the OpenAI LLM via their `functions` parameter. This is similar to how we pass tools for the agent to use. When the `Response` function is called by OpenAI, we want to use that as a signal to return to the user. When any other function is called by OpenAI, we treat that as a tool invocation. Therefore, our parsing logic has the following blocks: - If no function is called, assume that we should use the response to respond to the user, and therefore return `AgentFinish` - If the `Response` function is called, respond to the user with the inputs to that function (our structured output), and therefore return `AgentFinish` - If any other function is called, treat that as a tool invocation, and therefore return `AgentActionMessageLog` Note that we are using `AgentActionMessageLog` rather than `AgentAction` because it lets us attach a log of messages that we can use in the future to pass back into the agent prompt. ```python import json from langchain.schema.agent import AgentActionMessageLog, AgentFinish ``` ```python def parse(output): # If no function was invoked, return to user if ""function_call"" not in output.additional_kwargs: return AgentFinish(return_values={""output"": output.content}, log=output.content) # Parse out the function call function_call = output.additional_kwargs[""function_call""] name = function_call[""name""] inputs = json.loads(function_call[""arguments""]) # If the Response function was invoked, return to the user with the function inputs if name == ""Response"": return AgentFinish(return_values=inputs, log=str(function_call)) # Otherwise, return an agent action else: return AgentActionMessageLog( tool=name, tool_input=inputs, log="""", message_log=[output] ) ``` ## Create the Agent We can now put this all together! The components of this agent are: - prompt: a simple prompt with placeholders for the user\'s question and then the `agent_scratchpad` (any intermediate steps) - tools: we can attach the tools and `Response` format to the LLM as functions - format scratchpad: in order to format the `agent_scratchpad` from intermediate steps, we will use the standard `format_to_openai_function_messages`. This takes intermediate steps and formats them as AIMessages and FunctionMessages. - output parser: we will use our custom parser above to parse the response of the LLM - AgentExecutor: we will use the standard AgentExecutor to run the loop of agent-tool-agent-tool... ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function ``` ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a helpful assistant""), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python llm_with_tools = llm.bind( functions=[ # The retriever tool format_tool_to_openai_function(retriever_tool), # Response schema convert_pydantic_to_openai_function(Response), ] ) ``` ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], # Format agent scratchpad from intermediate steps ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | parse ) ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor(tools=[retriever_tool], agent=agent, verbose=True) ``` ## Run the agent We can now run the agent! Notice how it responds with a dictionary with two keys: `answer` and `sources` ```python agent_executor.invoke( {""input"": ""what did the president say about kentaji brown jackson""}, return_only_outputs=True, ) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

The `MultiQueryRetriever` automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents.

73,what does on_tool_start mean?,"['Pairwise string comparison | Pairwise string comparison []( Often you will want to compare predictions of an LLM, Chain, or Agent for a given input. The `StringComparison` evaluators facilitate this so you can answer questions like: - Which LLM or prompt produces a preferred output for a given question? - Which examples should I include for few-shot example selection? - Which output is better to include for fine-tuning? The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `pairwise_string` evaluator. Check out the reference docs for the [PairwiseStringEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are relevant to the question asked, as they both provide a numerical answer to the question about the number of dogs in the park. However, Response A is incorrect according to the reference answer, which states that there are four dogs. Response B, on the other hand, is correct as it matches the reference answer. Neither response demonstrates depth of thought, as they both simply provide a numerical answer without any additional information or context. \\n\\nBased on these criteria, Response B is the better response.\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Methods The pairwise string evaluator can be called using [evaluate_string_pairs]( (or async [aevaluate_string_pairs]( methods, which accept: - prediction (str) The predicted response of the first model, chain, or prompt. - prediction_b (str) The predicted response of the second model, chain, or prompt. - input (str) The input question, prompt, or other text. - reference (str) (Only for the labeled_pairwise_string variant) The reference response. They return a dictionary with the following values: - value: \'A\' or \'B\', indicating whether `prediction` or `prediction_b` is preferred, respectively - score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the \'value\', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `prediction_b` is preferred. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Without References When references aren\'t available, you can still predict the preferred response. The results will reflect the evaluation model\'s preference, which is less reliable and may result in preferences that are factually incorrect. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Addition is a mathematical operation."", prediction_b=""Addition is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers to create a third number, the \'sum\'."", input=""What is addition?"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are correct and relevant to the question. However, Response B is more helpful and insightful as it provides a more detailed explanation of what addition is. Response A is correct but lacks depth as it does not explain what the operation of addition entails. \\n\\nFinal Decision: [[B]]\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Defining the Criteria By default, the LLM is instructed to select the \'preferred\' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms: - [Criteria]( enum or its string value - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions - [Constitutional principal]( - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain - Dictionary: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description. - A list of criteria or constitutional principles - to combine multiple criteria in one. Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style. ```python custom_criteria = { ""simplicity"": ""Is the language straightforward and unpretentious?"", ""clarity"": ""Are the sentences clear and easy to understand?"", ""precision"": ""Is the writing precise, with no unnecessary words or details?"", ""truthfulness"": ""Does the writing feel honest and sincere?"", ""subtext"": ""Does the writing suggest deeper meanings or themes?"", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"", criteria=custom_criteria) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Every cheerful household shares a similar rhythm of joy; but sorrow, in each household, plays a unique, haunting melody."", prediction_b=""Where one finds a symphony of joy, every domicile of happiness resounds in harmonious,"" "" identical notes; yet, every abode of despair conducts a dissonant orchestra, each"" "" playing an elegy of grief that is peculiar and profound to its own existence."", input=""Write some prose about families."", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Response A is simple, clear, and precise. It uses straightforward language to convey a deep and sincere message about families. The metaphor of joy and sorrow as music is effective and easy to understand.\\n\\nResponse B, on the other hand, is more complex and less clear. The language is more pretentious, with words like ""domicile,"" ""resounds,"" ""abode,"" ""dissonant,"" and ""elegy."" While it conveys a similar message to Response A, it does so in a more convoluted way. The precision is also lacking due to the use of unnecessary words and details.\\n\\nBoth responses suggest deeper meanings or themes about the shared joy and unique sorrow in families. However, Response A does so in a more effective and accessible way.\\n\\nTherefore, the better response is [[A]].\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` ## Customize the LLM By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain. You can customize this when loading. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"", llm=llm) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Here is my assessment:\\n\\nResponse B is more helpful, insightful, and accurate than Response A. Response B simply states ""4"", which directly answers the question by providing the exact number of dogs mentioned in the reference answer. In contrast, Response A states ""there are three dogs"", which is incorrect according to the reference answer. \\n\\nIn terms of helpfulness, Response B gives the precise number while Response A provides an inaccurate guess. For relevance, both refer to dogs in the park from the question. However, Response B is more correct and factual based on the reference answer. Response A shows some attempt at reasoning but is ultimately incorrect. Response B requires less depth of thought to simply state the factual number.\\n\\nIn summary, Response B is superior in terms of helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth. My final decision is: [[B]]\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Customize the Evaluation Prompt You can use your own custom evaluation prompt to add more task-specific instructions or to instruct the evaluator to score the output. *Note: If you use a prompt that expects generates a result in a unique format, you may also have to pass in a custom output parser (`output_parser=your_parser()`) instead of the default `PairwiseStringResultOutputParser` ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the input context, which do you prefer: A or B?

The user input is just the question. So we need to get the context using our retriever and passthrough the user input under the ""question"" key. Note that when composing a RunnableMap when another Runnable we don\'t even need to wrap our dictionary in the RunnableMap class the type conversion is handled for us. ## Parallelism RunnableMaps are also useful for running independent processes in parallel, since each Runnable in the map is executed in parallel. For example, we can see our earlier `joke_chain`, `poem_chain` and `map_chain` all have about the same runtime, even though `map_chain` executes both of the other two. ```python joke_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bear""}) ``` ```text 958 ms 402 ms per loop (mean std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) ``` ```python poem_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bear""}) ``` ```text 1.22 s 508 ms per loop (mean std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) ``` ```python map_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bear""}) ``` ```text 1.15 s 119 ms per loop (mean std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) ``` - [Manipulating outputs/inputs](#manipulating-outputsinputs) - [Parallelism](#parallelism)', 'Agent Trajectory | Agent Trajectory []( Agents can be difficult to holistically evaluate due to the breadth of actions and generation they can make.

You can select any chat model for the agent trajectory evaluator as below. ```python # %pip install anthropic # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic eval_llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""trajectory"", llm=eval_llm) ``` ```python evaluation_result = evaluator.evaluate_agent_trajectory( prediction=result[""output""], input=result[""input""], agent_trajectory=result[""intermediate_steps""], ) evaluation_result ``` ```text {\'score\': 1.0, \'reasoning\': ""Here is my detailed evaluation of the AI\'s response:\\n\\ni.

Technologies like radioisotope decay heat and small fission reactors allow probes, satellites, and missions to operate far from the Sun and for extended periods by generating electricity and heat without reliance on solar energy. ``` - [Recreating with LCEL](#recreating-with-lcel) - [Example run](#example-run)', 'RAG | RAG Let\'s look at adding in a retrieval step to a prompt and LLM, which adds up to a ""retrieval-augmented generation"" chain ```bash pip install langchain openai faiss-cpu tiktoken ``` ```python from operator import itemgetter from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda, RunnablePassthrough from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS ``` ```python vectorstore = FAISS.from_texts( [""harrison worked at kensho""], embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings() ) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() template = """"""Answer the question based only on the following context: {context} Question: {question} """""" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template) model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = ( {""context"": retriever, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke(""where did harrison work?"") ``` ```text \'Harrison worked at Kensho.\' ``` ```python template = """"""Answer the question based only on the following context: {context} Question: {question} Answer in the following language: {language} """""" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template) chain = ( { ""context"": itemgetter(""question"") | retriever, ""question"": itemgetter(""question""), ""language"": itemgetter(""language""), } | prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""question"": ""where did harrison work"", ""language"": ""italian""}) ``` ```text \'Harrison ha lavorato a Kensho.\' ``` ## Conversational Retrieval Chain We can easily add in conversation history.

Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`.

75,How can I use OpenAI functions to get structured outputs in a chain?,"['Using OpenAI functions | Using OpenAI functions This walkthrough demonstrates how to incorporate OpenAI function-calling API\'s in a chain. We\'ll go over: 1. How to use functions to get structured outputs from ChatOpenAI 2. How to create a generic chain that uses (multiple) functions 3. How to create a chain that actually executes the chosen function ```python from typing import Optional from langchain.chains.openai_functions import ( create_openai_fn_chain, create_openai_fn_runnable, create_structured_output_chain, create_structured_output_runnable, ) from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate ``` ## Getting structured outputs We can take advantage of OpenAI functions to try and force the model to return a particular kind of structured output. We\'ll use `create_structured_output_runnable` to create our chain, which takes the desired structured output either as a Pydantic class or as JsonSchema. ### Using Pydantic classes When passing in Pydantic classes to structure our text, we need to make sure to have a docstring description for the class. It also helps to have descriptions for each of the classes attributes. ```python from langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field class Person(BaseModel): """"""Identifying information about a person."""""" name: str = Field(..., description=""The person\'s name"") age: int = Field(..., description=""The person\'s age"") fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=""The person\'s favorite food"") ``` ```python # If we pass in a model explicitly, we need to make sure it supports the OpenAI function-calling API. llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"", temperature=0) prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are a world class algorithm for extracting information in structured formats."", ), ( ""human"", ""Use the given format to extract information from the following input: {input}"", ), (""human"", ""Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format""), ] ) runnable = create_structured_output_runnable(Person, llm, prompt) runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Sally is 13""}) ``` ```text Person(name=\'Sally\', age=13, fav_food=\'Unknown\') ``` To extract arbitrarily many structured outputs of a given format, we can just create a wrapper Pydantic class that takes a sequence of the original class. ```python from typing import Sequence class People(BaseModel): """"""Identifying information about all people in a text."""""" people: Sequence[Person] = Field(..., description=""The people in the text"") runnable = create_structured_output_runnable(People, llm, prompt) runnable.invoke( { ""input"": ""Sally is 13, Joey just turned 12 and loves spinach. Caroline is 10 years older than Sally."" } ) ``` ```text People(people=[Person(name=\'Sally\', age=13, fav_food=\'\'), Person(name=\'Joey\', age=12, fav_food=\'spinach\'), Person(name=\'Caroline\', age=23, fav_food=\'\')]) ``` ### Using JsonSchema We can also pass in JsonSchema instead of Pydantic classes to specify the desired structure. When we do this, our chain will output JSON corresponding to the properties described in the JsonSchema, instead of a Pydantic class. ```python json_schema = { ""title"": ""Person"", ""description"": ""Identifying information about a person."", ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""name"": {""title"": ""Name"", ""description"": ""The person\'s name"", ""type"": ""string""}, ""age"": {""title"": ""Age"", ""description"": ""The person\'s age"", ""type"": ""integer""}, ""fav_food"": { ""title"": ""Fav Food"", ""description"": ""The person\'s favorite food"", ""type"": ""string"", }, }, ""required"": [""name"", ""age""], } ``` ```python runnable = create_structured_output_runnable(json_schema, llm, prompt) runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Sally is 13""}) ``` ```text {\'name\': \'Sally\', \'age\': 13} ``` ### [Legacy] LLMChain-based approach ```python chain = create_structured_output_chain(Person, llm, prompt, verbose=True) chain.run(""Sally is 13"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: System: You are a world class algorithm for extracting information in structured formats. Human: Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Sally is 13 Human: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format > Finished chain. Person(name=\'Sally\', age=13, fav_food=\'Unknown\') ``` ## Creating a generic OpenAI functions chain To create a generic OpenAI functions chain, we can use the `create_openai_fn_runnable` method. This is the same as `create_structured_output_runnable` except that instead of taking a single output schema, it takes a sequence of function definitions. Functions can be passed in as: - dicts conforming to OpenAI functions spec, - Pydantic classes, in which case they should have docstring descriptions of the function they represent and descriptions for each of the parameters, - Python functions, in which case they should have docstring descriptions of the function and args, along with type hints. ### Using Pydantic classes ```python class RecordPerson(BaseModel): """"""Record some identifying information about a pe."""""" name: str = Field(..., description=""The person\'s name"") age: int = Field(..., description=""The person\'s age"") fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=""The person\'s favorite food"") class RecordDog(BaseModel): """"""Record some identifying information about a dog."""""" name: str = Field(..., description=""The dog\'s name"") color: str = Field(..., description=""The dog\'s color"") fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=""The dog\'s favorite food"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains.openai_functions import ( convert_to_openai_function, get_openai_output_parser, ) prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a world class algorithm for recording entities.""), ( ""human"", ""Make calls to the relevant function to record the entities in the following input: {input}"", ), (""human"", ""Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format""), ] ) openai_functions = [convert_to_openai_function(f) for f in (RecordPerson, RecordDog)] llm_kwargs = {""functions"": openai_functions} if len(openai_functions) == 1: llm_kwargs[""function_call""] = {""name"": openai_functions[0][""name""]} output_parser = get_openai_output_parser((RecordPerson, RecordDog)) runnable = prompt | llm.bind(**llm_kwargs) | output_parser ``` ```python runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Harry was a chubby brown beagle who loved chicken""}) ``` ```text RecordDog(name=\'Harry\', color=\'brown\', fav_food=\'chicken\') ``` For convenience we can use the `create_openai_fn_runnable` method to help build our Runnable ```python runnable = create_openai_fn_runnable([RecordPerson, RecordDog], llm, prompt) runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Harry was a chubby brown beagle who loved chicken""}) ``` ```text RecordDog(name=\'Harry\', color=\'brown\', fav_food=\'chicken\') ``` ### Using Python functions We can pass in functions as Pydantic classes, directly as OpenAI function dicts, or Python functions. To pass Python function in directly, we\'ll want to make sure our parameters have type hints, we have a docstring, and we use [Google Python style docstrings]( to describe the parameters. **NOTE**: To use Python functions, make sure the function arguments are of primitive types (str, float, int, bool) or that they are Pydantic objects. ```python class OptionalFavFood(BaseModel): """"""Either a food or null."""""" food: Optional[str] = Field( None, description=""Either the name of a food or null. Should be null if the food isn\'t known."", ) def record_person(name: str, age: int, fav_food: OptionalFavFood) -> str: """"""Record some basic identifying information about a person.

We will add the [ConversationBufferMemory]( class, although this can be any memory class. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` The most important step is setting up the prompt correctly. In the below prompt, we have two input keys: one for the actual input, another for the input from the Memory class. Importantly, we make sure the keys in the `PromptTemplate` and the `ConversationBufferMemory` match up (`chat_history`). ```python template = """"""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. {chat_history} Human: {human_input} Chatbot:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""chat_history"", ""human_input""], template=template ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

Chatbot: > Finished chain. "" I\'m doing great, thanks for asking! How are you doing?"" ``` ## Adding Memory to a chat model-based LLMChain The above works for completion-style `LLM`s, but if you are using a chat model, you will likely get better performance using structured chat messages. Below is an example. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, ) from langchain.schema import SystemMessage ``` We will use the [ChatPromptTemplate]( class to set up the chat prompt.

By default, most of the agents return a single string. It can often be useful to have an agent return something with more structure. A good example of this is an agent tasked with doing question-answering over some sources. Let\'s say we want the agent to respond not only with the answer, but also a list of the sources used. We then want our output to roughly follow the schema below: ```python class Response(BaseModel): """"""Final response to the question being asked"""""" answer: str = Field(description = ""The final answer to respond to the user"") sources: List[int] = Field(description=""List of page chunks that contain answer to the question. Only include a page chunk if it contains relevant information"") ``` In this notebook we will go over an agent that has a retriever tool and responds in the correct format. ## Create the Retriever In this section we will do some setup work to create our retriever over some mock data containing the ""State of the Union"" address. Importantly, we will add a ""page_chunk"" tag to the metadata of each document. This is just some fake data intended to simulate a source field. In practice, this would more likely be the URL or path of a document. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python # Load in document to retrieve over loader = TextLoader(""../../state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() # Split document into chunks text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) # Here is where we add in the fake source information for i, doc in enumerate(texts): doc.metadata[""page_chunk""] = i # Create our retriever embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings, collection_name=""state-of-union"") retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() ``` ## Create the tools We will now create the tools we want to give to the agent. In this case, it is just one - a tool that wraps our retriever. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.conversational_retrieval.tool import ( create_retriever_tool, ) retriever_tool = create_retriever_tool( retriever, ""state-of-union-retriever"", ""Query a retriever to get information about state of the union address"", ) ``` ## Create response schema Here is where we will define the response schema. In this case, we want the final answer to have two fields: one for the `answer`, and then another that is a list of `sources` ```python from typing import List from langchain.utils.openai_functions import convert_pydantic_to_openai_function from pydantic import BaseModel, Field class Response(BaseModel): """"""Final response to the question being asked"""""" answer: str = Field(description=""The final answer to respond to the user"") sources: List[int] = Field( description=""List of page chunks that contain answer to the question. Only include a page chunk if it contains relevant information"" ) ``` ## Create the custom parsing logic We now create some custom parsing logic. How this works is that we will pass the `Response` schema to the OpenAI LLM via their `functions` parameter. This is similar to how we pass tools for the agent to use. When the `Response` function is called by OpenAI, we want to use that as a signal to return to the user. When any other function is called by OpenAI, we treat that as a tool invocation. Therefore, our parsing logic has the following blocks: - If no function is called, assume that we should use the response to respond to the user, and therefore return `AgentFinish` - If the `Response` function is called, respond to the user with the inputs to that function (our structured output), and therefore return `AgentFinish` - If any other function is called, treat that as a tool invocation, and therefore return `AgentActionMessageLog` Note that we are using `AgentActionMessageLog` rather than `AgentAction` because it lets us attach a log of messages that we can use in the future to pass back into the agent prompt. ```python import json from langchain.schema.agent import AgentActionMessageLog, AgentFinish ``` ```python def parse(output): # If no function was invoked, return to user if ""function_call"" not in output.additional_kwargs: return AgentFinish(return_values={""output"": output.content}, log=output.content) # Parse out the function call function_call = output.additional_kwargs[""function_call""] name = function_call[""name""] inputs = json.loads(function_call[""arguments""]) # If the Response function was invoked, return to the user with the function inputs if name == ""Response"": return AgentFinish(return_values=inputs, log=str(function_call)) # Otherwise, return an agent action else: return AgentActionMessageLog( tool=name, tool_input=inputs, log="""", message_log=[output] ) ``` ## Create the Agent We can now put this all together! The components of this agent are: - prompt: a simple prompt with placeholders for the user\'s question and then the `agent_scratchpad` (any intermediate steps) - tools: we can attach the tools and `Response` format to the LLM as functions - format scratchpad: in order to format the `agent_scratchpad` from intermediate steps, we will use the standard `format_to_openai_function_messages`. This takes intermediate steps and formats them as AIMessages and FunctionMessages. - output parser: we will use our custom parser above to parse the response of the LLM - AgentExecutor: we will use the standard AgentExecutor to run the loop of agent-tool-agent-tool... ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function ``` ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a helpful assistant""), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python llm_with_tools = llm.bind( functions=[ # The retriever tool format_tool_to_openai_function(retriever_tool), # Response schema convert_pydantic_to_openai_function(Response), ] ) ``` ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], # Format agent scratchpad from intermediate steps ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | parse ) ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor(tools=[retriever_tool], agent=agent, verbose=True) ``` ## Run the agent We can now run the agent! Notice how it responds with a dictionary with two keys: `answer` and `sources` ```python agent_executor.invoke( {""input"": ""what did the president say about kentaji brown jackson""}, return_only_outputs=True, ) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Show this page source', 'Xata | Xata [Xata]( is a serverless data platform, based on `PostgreSQL` and `Elasticsearch`. It provides a Python SDK for interacting with your database, and a UI for managing your data. With the `XataChatMessageHistory` class, you can use Xata databases for longer-term persistence of chat sessions. This notebook covers: - A simple example showing what `XataChatMessageHistory` does. - A more complex example using a REACT agent that answer questions based on a knowledge based or documentation (stored in Xata as a vector store) and also having a long-term searchable history of its past messages (stored in Xata as a memory store) ## Setup ### Create a database In the [Xata UI]( create a new database. You can name it whatever you want, in this notepad we\'ll use `langchain`. The Langchain integration can auto-create the table used for storying the memory, and this is what we\'ll use in this example. If you want to pre-create the table, ensure it has the right schema and set `create_table` to `False` when creating the class. Pre-creating the table saves one round-trip to the database during each session initialization. Let\'s first install our dependencies: ```bash pip install xata openai langchain ``` Next, we need to get the environment variables for Xata. You can create a new API key by visiting your [account settings]( To find the database URL, go to the Settings page of the database that you have created. The database URL should look something like this: ` ```python import getpass api_key = getpass.getpass(""Xata API key: "") db_url = input(""Xata database URL (copy it from your DB settings):"") ``` ## Create a simple memory store To test the memory store functionality in isolation, let\'s use the following code snippet: ```python from langchain.memory import XataChatMessageHistory history = XataChatMessageHistory( session_id=""session-1"", api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""memory"" ) history.add_user_message(""hi!"") history.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` The above code creates a session with the ID `session-1` and stores two messages in it. After running the above, if you visit the Xata UI, you should see a table named `memory` and the two messages added to it. You can retrieve the message history for a particular session with the following code: ```python history.messages ``` ## Conversational Q&A chain on your data with memory Let\'s now see a more complex example in which we combine OpenAI, the Xata Vector Store integration, and the Xata memory store integration to create a Q&A chat bot on your data, with follow-up questions and history. We\'re going to need to access the OpenAI API, so let\'s configure the API key: ```python import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` To store the documents that the chatbot will search for answers, add a table named `docs` to your `langchain` database using the Xata UI, and add the following columns: - `content` of type ""Text"". This is used to store the `Document.pageContent` values. - `embedding` of type ""Vector"". Use the dimension used by the model you plan to use. In this notebook we use OpenAI embeddings, which have 1536 dimensions. Let\'s create the vector store and add some sample docs to it: ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores.xata import XataVectorStore embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() texts = [ ""Xata is a Serverless Data platform based on PostgreSQL"", ""Xata offers a built-in vector type that can be used to store and query vectors"", ""Xata includes similarity search"", ] vector_store = XataVectorStore.from_texts( texts, embeddings, api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""docs"" ) ``` After running the above command, if you go to the Xata UI, you should see the documents loaded together with their embeddings in the `docs` table. Let\'s now create a ConversationBufferMemory to store the chat messages from both the user and the AI. ```python from uuid import uuid4 from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory chat_memory = XataChatMessageHistory( session_id=str(uuid4()), # needs to be unique per user session api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""memory"", ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory( memory_key=""chat_history"", chat_memory=chat_memory, return_messages=True ) ``` Now it\'s time to create an Agent to use both the vector store and the chat memory together. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI tool = create_retriever_tool( vector_store.as_retriever(), ""search_docs"", ""Searches and returns documents from the Xata manual. Useful when you need to answer questions about Xata."", ) tools = [tool] llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` To test, let\'s tell the agent our name: ```python agent.run(input=""My name is bob"") ``` Now, let\'s now ask the agent some questions about Xata: ```python agent.run(input=""What is xata?"") ``` Notice that it answers based on the data stored in the document store. And now, let\'s ask a follow up question: ```python agent.run(input=""Does it support similarity search?"") ``` And now let\'s test its memory: ```python agent.run(input=""Did I tell you my name? What is it?"") ``` - [Setup](#setup)- [Create a database](#create-a-database) - [Create a simple memory store](#create-a-simple-memory-store) - [Conversational Q&A chain on your data with memory](#conversational-qa-chain-on-your-data-with-memory)', 'Fleet AI Libraries Context | Fleet AI Libraries Context The Fleet AI team is on a mission to embed the world\'s most important data.

This means the vectors correspond to sections of pages in the LangChain docs, not entire pages.

Log10 is an [open-source]( proxiless LLM data management and application development platform that lets you log, debug and tag your Langchain calls. ## Quick start 1. Create your free account at [log10.io]( 2. Add your `LOG10_TOKEN` and `LOG10_ORG_ID` from the Settings and Organization tabs respectively as environment variables. 3. Also add `LOG10_URL= and your usual LLM API key: for e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to your environment ## How to enable Log10 data management for Langchain Integration with log10 is a simple one-line `log10_callback` integration as shown below: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage from log10.langchain import Log10Callback from log10.llm import Log10Config log10_callback = Log10Callback(log10_config=Log10Config()) messages = [ HumanMessage(content=""You are a ping pong machine""), HumanMessage(content=""Ping?""), ] llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", callbacks=[log10_callback]) ``` [Log10 + Langchain + Logs docs]( [More details + screenshots]( including instructions for self-hosting logs ## How to use tags with Log10 ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage from log10.langchain import Log10Callback from log10.llm import Log10Config log10_callback = Log10Callback(log10_config=Log10Config()) messages = [ HumanMessage(content=""You are a ping pong machine""), HumanMessage(content=""Ping?""), ] llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", callbacks=[log10_callback], temperature=0.5, tags=[""test""]) completion = llm.predict_messages(messages, tags=[""foobar""]) print(completion) llm = ChatAnthropic(model=""claude-2"", callbacks=[log10_callback], temperature=0.7, tags=[""baz""]) llm.predict_messages(messages) print(completion) llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-003"", callbacks=[log10_callback], temperature=0.5) completion = llm.predict(""You are a ping pong machine.\\nPing?\\n"") print(completion) ``` You can also intermix direct OpenAI calls and Langchain LLM calls: ```python import os from log10.load import log10, log10_session import openai from langchain.llms import OpenAI log10(openai) with log10_session(tags=[""foo"", ""bar""]): # Log a direct OpenAI call response = openai.Completion.create( model=""text-ada-001"", prompt=""Where is the Eiffel Tower?"", temperature=0, max_tokens=1024, top_p=1, frequency_penalty=0, presence_penalty=0, ) print(response) # Log a call via Langchain llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-ada-001"", temperature=0.5) response = llm.predict(""You are a ping pong machine.\\nPing?\\n"") print(response) ``` ## How to debug Langchain calls [Example of debugging]( [More Langchain examples]( - [What is Log10?](#what-is-log10) - [Quick start](#quick-start) - [How to enable Log10 data management for Langchain](#how-to-enable-log10-data-management-for-langchain) - [How to use tags with Log10](#how-to-use-tags-with-log10) - [How to debug Langchain calls](#how-to-debug-langchain-calls)', 'RePhraseQuery | RePhraseQuery `RePhraseQuery` is a simple retriever that applies an LLM between the user input and the query passed by the retriever.

We will add the [ConversationBufferMemory]( class, although this can be any memory class. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` The most important step is setting up the prompt correctly. In the below prompt, we have two input keys: one for the actual input, another for the input from the Memory class. Importantly, we make sure the keys in the `PromptTemplate` and the `ConversationBufferMemory` match up (`chat_history`). ```python template = """"""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. {chat_history} Human: {human_input} Chatbot:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""chat_history"", ""human_input""], template=template ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

Below is an example. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, ) from langchain.schema import SystemMessage ``` We will use the [ChatPromptTemplate]( class to set up the chat prompt. The [from_messages]( method creates a `ChatPromptTemplate` from a list of messages (e.g., `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ChatMessage`, etc.) or message templates, such as the [MessagesPlaceholder]( below. The configuration below makes it so the memory will be injected to the middle of the chat prompt, in the `chat_history` key, and the user\'s inputs will be added in a human/user message to the end of the chat prompt. ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The persistent system prompt MessagesPlaceholder( variable_name=""chat_history"" ), # Where the memory will be stored.

78,hw do i create a prompt template for my chat bot,"['Prompt templates | Prompt templates Prompt templates are pre-defined recipes for generating prompts for language models. A template may include instructions, few-shot examples, and specific context and questions appropriate for a given task. LangChain provides tooling to create and work with prompt templates. LangChain strives to create model agnostic templates to make it easy to reuse existing templates across different language models. Typically, language models expect the prompt to either be a string or else a list of chat messages. ## PromptTemplate Use `PromptTemplate` to create a template for a string prompt. By default, `PromptTemplate` uses [Python\'s str.format]( syntax for templating. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."" ) prompt_template.format(adjective=""funny"", content=""chickens"") ``` ```text \'Tell me a funny joke about chickens.\' ``` The template supports any number of variables, including no variables: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke"") prompt_template.format() ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke\' ``` For additional validation, specify `input_variables` explicitly. These variables will be compared against the variables present in the template string during instantiation, **raising an exception if there is a mismatch**. For example: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate invalid_prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""adjective""], template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."", ) ``` ```text --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ValidationError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[19], line 3 1 from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ----> 3 invalid_prompt = PromptTemplate( 4 input_variables=[""adjective""], 5 template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."" 6 ) File ~/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/load/serializable.py:97, in Serializable.__init__(self, **kwargs) 96 def __init__(self, **kwargs: Any) -> None: ---> 97 super().__init__(**kwargs) 98 self._lc_kwargs = kwargs File ~/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pydantic/main.py:341, in pydantic.main.BaseModel.__init__() ValidationError: 1 validation error for PromptTemplate __root__ Invalid prompt schema; check for mismatched or missing input parameters. \'content\' (type=value_error) ``` You can create custom prompt templates that format the prompt in any way you want. For more information, see [Custom Prompt Templates](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/custom_prompt_template.html). ## ChatPromptTemplate The prompt to [chat models](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/models/chat) is a list of chat messages. Each chat message is associated with content, and an additional parameter called `role`. For example, in the OpenAI [Chat Completions API]( a chat message can be associated with an AI assistant, a human or a system role. Create a chat prompt template like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a helpful AI bot. Your name is {name}.""), (""human"", ""Hello, how are you doing?""), (""ai"", ""I\'m doing well, thanks!""), (""human"", ""{user_input}""), ] ) messages = chat_template.format_messages(name=""Bob"", user_input=""What is your name?"") ``` `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages` accepts a variety of message representations. For example, in addition to using the 2-tuple representation of (type, content) used above, you could pass in an instance of `MessagePromptTemplate` or `BaseMessage`. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import HumanMessagePromptTemplate from langchain.schema.messages import SystemMessage chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=( ""You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to "" ""sound more upbeat."" ) ), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{text}""), ] ) llm = ChatOpenAI() llm(chat_template.format_messages(text=""i dont like eating tasty things."")) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'I absolutely love indulging in delicious treats!\') ``` This provides you with a lot of flexibility in how you construct your chat prompts. ## LCEL `PromptTemplate` and `ChatPromptTemplate` implement the [Runnable interface](/docs/expression_language/interface), the basic building block of the [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/expression_language/). This means they support `invoke`, `ainvoke`, `stream`, `astream`, `batch`, `abatch`, `astream_log` calls. `PromptTemplate` accepts a dictionary (of the prompt variables) and returns a `StringPromptValue`. A `ChatPromptTemplate` accepts a dictionary and returns a `ChatPromptValue`. ```python prompt_val = prompt_template.invoke({""adjective"": ""funny"", ""content"": ""chickens""}) prompt_val ``` ```text StringPromptValue(text=\'Tell me a joke\') ``` ```python prompt_val.to_string() ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke\' ``` ```python prompt_val.to_messages() ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=\'Tell me a joke\')] ``` ```python chat_val = chat_template.invoke({""text"": ""i dont like eating tasty things.""}) ``` ```python chat_val.to_messages() ``` ```text [SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to sound more upbeat.""), HumanMessage(content=\'i dont like eating tasty things.\')] ``` ```python chat_val.to_string() ``` ```text ""System: You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to sound more upbeat.\\nHuman: i dont like eating tasty things."" ``` - [PromptTemplate](#prompttemplate) - [ChatPromptTemplate](#chatprompttemplate) - [LCEL](#lcel)', 'Chat Bot Feedback Template | Chat Bot Feedback Template This template shows how to evaluate your chat bot without explicit user feedback. It defines a simple chat bot in [chain.py](/docs/templates/chat_bot_feedback/chain.py) and custom evaluator that scores bot response effectiveness based on the subsequent user response. You can apply this run evaluator to your own chat bot by calling `with_config` on the chat bot before serving. You can also directly deploy your chat app using this template. [Chat bots]( are one of the most common interfaces for deploying LLMs. The quality of chat bots varies, making continuous development important. But users are wont to leave explicit feedback through mechanisms like thumbs-up or thumbs-down buttons. Furthermore, traditional analytics such as ""session length"" or ""conversation length"" often lack clarity. However, multi-turn conversations with a chat bot can provide a wealth of information, which we can transform into metrics for fine-tuning, evaluation, and product analytics. Taking [Chat Langchain]( as a case study, only about 0.04% of all queries receive explicit feedback. Yet, approximately 70% of the queries are follow-ups to previous questions. A significant portion of these follow-up queries continue useful information we can use to infer the quality of the previous AI response. This template helps solve this ""feedback scarcity"" problem. Below is an example invocation of this chat bot: []( When the user responds to this ([link]( the response evaluator is invoked, resulting in the following evaluationrun: []( As shown, the evaluator sees that the user is increasingly frustrated, indicating that the prior response was not effective ## LangSmith Feedback [LangSmith]( is a platform for building production-grade LLM applications. Beyond its debugging and offline evaluation features, LangSmith helps you capture both user and model-assisted feedback to refine your LLM application. This template uses an LLM to generate feedback for your application, which you can use to continuously improve your service. For more examples on collecting feedback using LangSmith, consult the [documentation]( ## Evaluator Implementation The user feedback is inferred by custom `RunEvaluator`. This evaluator is called using the `EvaluatorCallbackHandler`, which run it in a separate thread to avoid interfering with the chat bot\'s runtime. You can use this custom evaluator on any compatible chat bot by calling the following function on your LangChain object: ```python my_chain .with_config( callbacks=[ EvaluatorCallbackHandler( evaluators=[ ResponseEffectivenessEvaluator(evaluate_response_effectiveness) ] ) ], ) ``` The evaluator instructs an LLM, specifically `gpt-3.5-turbo`, to evaluate the AI\'s most recent chat message based on the user\'s followup response. It generates a score and accompanying reasoning that is converted to feedback in LangSmith, applied to the value provided as the `last_run_id`. The prompt used within the LLM [is available on the hub]( Feel free to customize it with things like additional app context (such as the goal of the app or the types of questions it should respond to) or ""symptoms"" you\'d like the LLM to focus on. This evaluator also utilizes OpenAI\'s function-calling API to ensure a more consistent, structured output for the grade. ## Environment Variables Ensure that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to use OpenAI models. Also, configure LangSmith by setting your `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`. ```bash export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=... export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=my-project # Set to the project you want to save to ``` ## Usage If deploying via `LangServe`, we recommend configuring the server to return callback events as well. This will ensure the backend traces are included in whatever traces you generate using the `RemoteRunnable`. ```python from chat_bot_feedback.chain import chain add_routes(app, chain, path=""/chat-bot-feedback"", include_callback_events=True) ``` With the server running, you can use the following code snippet to stream the chat bot responses for a 2 turn conversation. ```python from functools import partial from typing import Dict, Optional, Callable, List from langserve import RemoteRunnable from langchain.callbacks.manager import tracing_v2_enabled from langchain.schema import BaseMessage, AIMessage, HumanMessage # Update with the URL provided by your LangServe server chain = RemoteRunnable("" def stream_content( text: str, chat_history: Optional[List[BaseMessage]] = None, last_run_id: Optional[str] = None, on_chunk: Callable = None, ): results = [] with tracing_v2_enabled() as cb: for chunk in chain.stream( {""text"": text, ""chat_history"": chat_history, ""last_run_id"": last_run_id}, ): on_chunk(chunk) results.append(chunk) last_run_id = cb.latest_run.id if cb.latest_run else None return last_run_id, """".join(results) chat_history = [] text = ""Where are my keys?"" last_run_id, response_message = stream_content(text, on_chunk=partial(print, end="""")) print() chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=text), AIMessage(content=response_message)]) text = ""I CAN\'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE"" # The previous response will likely receive a low score, # as the user\'s frustration appears to be escalating. last_run_id, response_message = stream_content( text, chat_history=chat_history, last_run_id=str(last_run_id), on_chunk=partial(print, end=""""), ) print() chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=text), AIMessage(content=response_message)]) ``` This uses the `tracing_v2_enabled` callback manager to get the run ID of the call, which we provide in subsequent calls in the same chat thread, so the evaluator can assign feedback to the appropriate trace. ## Conclusion This template provides a simple chat bot definition you can directly deploy using LangServe. It defines a custom evaluator to log evaluation feedback for the bot without any explicit user ratings. This is an effective way to augment your analytics and to better select data points for fine-tuning and evaluation. - [LangSmith Feedback](#langsmith-feedback) - [Evaluator Implementation](#evaluator-implementation) - [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) - [Usage](#usage) - [Conclusion](#conclusion)', 'Prompt pipelining | Prompt pipelining The idea behind prompt pipelining is to provide a user friendly interface for composing different parts of prompts together. You can do this with either string prompts or chat prompts. Constructing prompts this way allows for easy reuse of components. ## String prompt pipelining When working with string prompts, each template is joined together. You can work with either prompts directly or strings (the first element in the list needs to be a prompt). ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` ```python prompt = ( PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") + "", make it funny"" + ""\\n\\nand in {language}"" ) ``` ```python prompt ``` ```text PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'language\', \'topic\'], output_parser=None, partial_variables={}, template=\'Tell me a joke about {topic}, make it funny\\n\\nand in {language}\', template_format=\'f-string\', validate_template=True) ``` ```python prompt.format(topic=""sports"", language=""spanish"") ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke about sports, make it funny\\n\\nand in spanish\' ``` You can also use it in an LLMChain, just like before. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=prompt) ``` ```python chain.run(topic=""sports"", language=""spanish"") ``` ```text \'Por qu el futbolista llevaba un paraguas al partido?\\n\\nPorque pronosticaban lluvia de goles.\' ``` ## Chat prompt pipelining A chat prompt is made up a of a list of messages. Purely for developer experience, we\'ve added a convinient way to create these prompts. In this pipeline, each new element is a new message in the final prompt. ```python from langchain.schema import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage ``` First, let\'s initialize the base ChatPromptTemplate with a system message. It doesn\'t have to start with a system, but it\'s often good practice ```python prompt = SystemMessage(content=""You are a nice pirate"") ``` You can then easily create a pipeline combining it with other messages _or_ message templates. Use a `Message` when there is no variables to be formatted, use a `MessageTemplate` when there are variables to be formatted. You can also use just a string (note: this will automatically get inferred as a HumanMessagePromptTemplate.) ```python new_prompt = ( prompt + HumanMessage(content=""hi"") + AIMessage(content=""what?"") + ""{input}"" ) ``` Under the hood, this creates an instance of the ChatPromptTemplate class, so you can use it just as you did before! ```python new_prompt.format_messages(input=""i said hi"") ``` ```text [SystemMessage(content=\'You are a nice pirate\', additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessage(content=\'hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'what?\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=\'i said hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)] ``` You can also use it in an LLMChain, just like before. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=new_prompt) ``` ```python chain.run(""i said hi"") ``` ```text \'Oh, hello! How can I assist you today?\' ``` - [String prompt pipelining](#string-prompt-pipelining) - [Chat prompt pipelining](#chat-prompt-pipelining)', 'Shared memory across agents and tools | Shared memory across agents and tools This notebook goes over adding memory to **both** an Agent and its tools.

The summarization tool also needs access to the conversation memory. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, Tool, ZeroShotAgent from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory, ReadOnlySharedMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper ``` ```python template = """"""This is a conversation between a human and a bot: {chat_history} Write a summary of the conversation for {input}: """""" prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[""input"", ""chat_history""], template=template) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") readonlymemory = ReadOnlySharedMemory(memory=memory) summary_chain = LLMChain( llm=OpenAI(), prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=readonlymemory, # use the read-only memory to prevent the tool from modifying the memory ) ``` ```python search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper() tools = [ Tool( name=""Search"", func=search.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", ), Tool( name=""Summary"", func=summary_chain.run, description=""useful for when you summarize a conversation.

The tool is a wrapper for the [PyGitHub]( library. ## Quickstart 1. Install the pygithub library 2. Create a Github app 3. Set your environmental variables 4. Pass the tools to your agent with `toolkit.get_tools()` Each of these steps will be explained in great detail below. 1. **Get Issues**- fetches issues from the repository. 2. **Get Issue**- fetches details about a specific issue. 3. **Comment on Issue**- posts a comment on a specific issue. 4. **Create Pull Request**- creates a pull request from the bot\'s working branch to the base branch. 5. **Create File**- creates a new file in the repository. 6. **Read File**- reads a file from the repository. 7. **Update File**- updates a file in the repository. 8. **Delete File**- deletes a file from the repository. ## Setup ### 1. Install the pygithub library ```python %pip install pygithub ``` ### 2. Create a Github App [Follow the instructions here]( to create and register a Github app. Make sure your app has the following [repository permissions:]( - Commit statuses (read only) - Contents (read and write) - Issues (read and write) - Metadata (read only) - Pull requests (read and write) Once the app has been registered, add it to the repository you wish the bot to act upon. ### 3. Set Environmental Variables Before initializing your agent, the following environmental variables need to be set: - **GITHUB_APP_ID**- A six digit number found in your app\'s general settings - **GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY**- The location of your app\'s private key .pem file - **GITHUB_REPOSITORY**- The name of the Github repository you want your bot to act upon. Must follow the format {username}/{repo-name}. Make sure the app has been added to this repository first! - **GITHUB_BRANCH**- The branch where the bot will make its commits. Defaults to \'master.\' - **GITHUB_BASE_BRANCH**- The base branch of your repo, usually either \'main\' or \'master.\' This is where pull requests will base from. Defaults to \'master.\' ## Example: Simple Agent ```python import os from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.github.toolkit import GitHubToolkit from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities.github import GitHubAPIWrapper ``` ```python # Set your environment variables using os.environ os.environ[""GITHUB_APP_ID""] = ""123456"" os.environ[""GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY""] = ""path/to/your/private-key.pem"" os.environ[""GITHUB_REPOSITORY""] = ""username/repo-name"" os.environ[""GITHUB_BRANCH""] = ""bot-branch-name"" os.environ[""GITHUB_BASE_BRANCH""] = ""main"" # This example also requires an OpenAI API key os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """" ``` ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) github = GitHubAPIWrapper() toolkit = GitHubToolkit.from_github_api_wrapper(github) agent = initialize_agent( toolkit.get_tools(), llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""You have the software engineering capabilities of a Google Principle engineer.

1. **Define the Purpose**: Determine what kind of interactions you want your chat bot to have. This could be customer support, information retrieval, or any specific task.

2. **Structure the Prompt**: Create a clear and structured format for your prompt. This usually includes:
   - **Greeting**: A welcome message.
   - **Instruction**: What the bot should do.
   - **Variables**: Placeholders for dynamic content that will be filled in based on user input.

3. **Example**: Here’s a simple example for a customer support bot:
   ```
   ""Hello! How can I assist you today? If you have any questions or need help with [specific task], just let me know.""
   ```

4. **Test and Refine**: Use the template to interact with your bot and refine it based on the responses and interactions.

Remember, the key is to make the prompt clear and user-friendly to ensure smooth interactions. If you need more specific guidance, feel free to ask!","To create a prompt template for a chat bot, you can use the `ChatPromptTemplate` class. You can initialize it with a list of chat messages, where each message has a role and content. The role can be 'system', 'human', or 'ai'. For example:

```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ('system', 'You are a helpful AI bot. Your name is {name}.'),
        ('human', 'Hello, how are you doing?'),
        ('ai', 'I'm doing well, thanks!'),
        ('human', '{user_input}'),
    ]
)

messages = chat_template.format_messages(name='Bob', user_input='What is your name?')
```

You can also use different subclasses of the `ChatMessagePromptTemplate` class, such as `SystemMessagePromptTemplate` and `HumanMessagePromptTemplate`, to customize the role or content of specific messages in the template. Finally, you can use the ""MessagesPlaceholder"" class to format chat history as a sequence of messages.",0.999999999975,1.0,,0.48593738187963065,0.20735785953177258

A RunnableRetry helps can be used to add retry logic to any object that subclasses the base Runnable. Such retries are especially useful for network calls that may fail due to transient errors. The RunnableRetry is implemented as a RunnableBinding. The easiest way to use it is through the .with_retry() method on all Runnables. Example: Here\'s an example that uses a RunnableLambda to raise an exception import time def foo(input) -> None: \'\'\'Fake function that raises an exception.\'\'\' raise ValueError(""Invoking foo failed. At time {time.time()}"") runnable = RunnableLambda(foo) runnable_with_retries = runnable.with_retry( retry_exception_types=(ValueError,), # Retry only on ValueError wait_exponential_jitter=True, # Add jitter to the exponential backoff max_attempt_number=2, # Try twice ) # The method invocation above is equivalent to the longer form below: runnable_with_retries = RunnableRetry( bound=runnable, retry_exception_types=(ValueError,), max_attempt_number=2, wait_exponential_jitter=True ) This logic can be used to retry any Runnable, including a chain of Runnables, but in general it\'s best practice to keep the scope of the retry as small as possible. For example, if you have a chain of Runnables, you should only retry the Runnable that is likely to fail, not the entire chain. Example from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate template = PromptTemplate.from_template(""tell me a joke about {topic}."") model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.5) # Good chain = template | model.with_retry() # Bad chain = template | model retryable_chain = chain.with_retry() Create a new model by parsing and validating input data from keyword arguments. Raises ValidationError if the input data cannot be parsed to form a valid model. param bound: Runnable[Input, Output] [Required] param config: RunnableConfig [Optional] param config_factories: List[Callable[[RunnableConfig], RunnableConfig]] [Optional] param custom_input_type: Optional[Any] = None param custom_output_type: Optional[Any] = None param kwargs: Mapping[str, Any] [Optional] param max_attempt_number: int = 3 The maximum number of attempts to retry the runnable. param retry_exception_types: Tuple[Type[BaseException], ...] = (,) The exception types to retry on.

80,what does runnable mean,"['Pairwise string comparison | Pairwise string comparison []( Often you will want to compare predictions of an LLM, Chain, or Agent for a given input. The `StringComparison` evaluators facilitate this so you can answer questions like: - Which LLM or prompt produces a preferred output for a given question? - Which examples should I include for few-shot example selection? - Which output is better to include for fine-tuning? The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `pairwise_string` evaluator. Check out the reference docs for the [PairwiseStringEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are relevant to the question asked, as they both provide a numerical answer to the question about the number of dogs in the park. However, Response A is incorrect according to the reference answer, which states that there are four dogs. Response B, on the other hand, is correct as it matches the reference answer. Neither response demonstrates depth of thought, as they both simply provide a numerical answer without any additional information or context. \\n\\nBased on these criteria, Response B is the better response.\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Methods The pairwise string evaluator can be called using [evaluate_string_pairs]( (or async [aevaluate_string_pairs]( methods, which accept: - prediction (str) The predicted response of the first model, chain, or prompt. - prediction_b (str) The predicted response of the second model, chain, or prompt. - input (str) The input question, prompt, or other text. - reference (str) (Only for the labeled_pairwise_string variant) The reference response. They return a dictionary with the following values: - value: \'A\' or \'B\', indicating whether `prediction` or `prediction_b` is preferred, respectively - score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the \'value\', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `prediction_b` is preferred. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Without References When references aren\'t available, you can still predict the preferred response. The results will reflect the evaluation model\'s preference, which is less reliable and may result in preferences that are factually incorrect. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Addition is a mathematical operation."", prediction_b=""Addition is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers to create a third number, the \'sum\'."", input=""What is addition?"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are correct and relevant to the question. However, Response B is more helpful and insightful as it provides a more detailed explanation of what addition is. Response A is correct but lacks depth as it does not explain what the operation of addition entails. \\n\\nFinal Decision: [[B]]\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Defining the Criteria By default, the LLM is instructed to select the \'preferred\' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms: - [Criteria]( enum or its string value - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions - [Constitutional principal]( - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain - Dictionary: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description. - A list of criteria or constitutional principles - to combine multiple criteria in one. Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style. ```python custom_criteria = { ""simplicity"": ""Is the language straightforward and unpretentious?"", ""clarity"": ""Are the sentences clear and easy to understand?"", ""precision"": ""Is the writing precise, with no unnecessary words or details?"", ""truthfulness"": ""Does the writing feel honest and sincere?"", ""subtext"": ""Does the writing suggest deeper meanings or themes?"", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"", criteria=custom_criteria) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Every cheerful household shares a similar rhythm of joy; but sorrow, in each household, plays a unique, haunting melody."", prediction_b=""Where one finds a symphony of joy, every domicile of happiness resounds in harmonious,"" "" identical notes; yet, every abode of despair conducts a dissonant orchestra, each"" "" playing an elegy of grief that is peculiar and profound to its own existence."", input=""Write some prose about families."", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Response A is simple, clear, and precise. It uses straightforward language to convey a deep and sincere message about families. The metaphor of joy and sorrow as music is effective and easy to understand.\\n\\nResponse B, on the other hand, is more complex and less clear. The language is more pretentious, with words like ""domicile,"" ""resounds,"" ""abode,"" ""dissonant,"" and ""elegy."" While it conveys a similar message to Response A, it does so in a more convoluted way. The precision is also lacking due to the use of unnecessary words and details.\\n\\nBoth responses suggest deeper meanings or themes about the shared joy and unique sorrow in families. However, Response A does so in a more effective and accessible way.\\n\\nTherefore, the better response is [[A]].\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` ## Customize the LLM By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain. You can customize this when loading. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"", llm=llm) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Here is my assessment:\\n\\nResponse B is more helpful, insightful, and accurate than Response A. Response B simply states ""4"", which directly answers the question by providing the exact number of dogs mentioned in the reference answer. In contrast, Response A states ""there are three dogs"", which is incorrect according to the reference answer. \\n\\nIn terms of helpfulness, Response B gives the precise number while Response A provides an inaccurate guess. For relevance, both refer to dogs in the park from the question. However, Response B is more correct and factual based on the reference answer. Response A shows some attempt at reasoning but is ultimately incorrect. Response B requires less depth of thought to simply state the factual number.\\n\\nIn summary, Response B is superior in terms of helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth. My final decision is: [[B]]\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Customize the Evaluation Prompt You can use your own custom evaluation prompt to add more task-specific instructions or to instruct the evaluator to score the output. *Note: If you use a prompt that expects generates a result in a unique format, you may also have to pass in a custom output parser (`output_parser=your_parser()`) instead of the default `PairwiseStringResultOutputParser` ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the input context, which do you prefer: A or B? Evaluate based on the following criteria: {criteria} Reason step by step and finally, respond with either [[A]] or [[B]] on its own line. DATA ---- input: {input} reference: {reference} A: {prediction} B: {prediction_b} --- Reasoning: """""" ) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"", prompt=prompt_template) ``` ```python # The prompt was assigned to the evaluator print(evaluator.prompt) ``` ```text input_variables=[\'prediction\', \'reference\', \'prediction_b\', \'input\'] output_parser=None partial_variables={\'criteria\': \'helpfulness: Is the submission helpful, insightful, and appropriate?\\nrelevance: Is the submission referring to a real quote from the text?\\ncorrectness: Is the submission correct, accurate, and factual?\\ndepth: Does the submission demonstrate depth of thought?\'} template=\'Given the input context, which do you prefer: A or B?\\nEvaluate based on the following criteria:\\n{criteria}\\nReason step by step and finally, respond with either [[A]] or [[B]] on its own line.\\n\\nDATA\\n----\\ninput: {input}\\nreference: {reference}\\nA: {prediction}\\nB: {prediction_b}\\n---\\nReasoning:\\n\\n\' template_format=\'f-string\' validate_template=True ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""The dog that ate the ice cream was named fido."", prediction_b=""The dog\'s name is spot"", input=""What is the name of the dog that ate the ice cream?"", reference=""The dog\'s name is fido"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Helpfulness: Both A and B are helpful as they provide a direct answer to the question.\\nRelevance: A is relevant as it refers to the correct name of the dog from the text. B is not relevant as it provides a different name.\\nCorrectness: A is correct as it accurately states the name of the dog. B is incorrect as it provides a different name.\\nDepth: Both A and B demonstrate a similar level of depth as they both provide a straightforward answer to the question.\\n\\nGiven these evaluations, the preferred response is:\\n\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` - [Methods](#methods) - [Without References](#without-references) - [Defining the Criteria](#defining-the-criteria) - [Customize the LLM](#customize-the-llm) - [Customize the Evaluation Prompt](#customize-the-evaluation-prompt)', 'Agent Trajectory | Agent Trajectory []( Agents can be difficult to holistically evaluate due to the breadth of actions and generation they can make. We recommend using multiple evaluation techniques appropriate to your use case. One way to evaluate an agent is to look at the whole trajectory of actions taken along with their responses. Evaluators that do this can implement the `AgentTrajectoryEvaluator` interface. This walkthrough will show how to use the `trajectory` evaluator to grade an OpenAI functions agent. For more information, check out the reference docs for the [TrajectoryEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""trajectory"") ``` ## Methods The Agent Trajectory Evaluators are used with the [evaluate_agent_trajectory]( (and async [aevaluate_agent_trajectory]( methods, which accept: - input (str) The input to the agent. - prediction (str) The final predicted response. - agent_trajectory (List[Tuple [AgentAction, str] ]) The intermediate steps forming the agent trajectory They return a dictionary with the following values: - score: Float from 0 to 1, where 1 would mean ""most effective"" and 0 would mean ""least effective"" - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Capturing Trajectory The easiest way to return an agent\'s trajectory (without using tracing callbacks like those in LangSmith) for evaluation is to initialize the agent with `return_intermediate_steps=True`. Below, create an example agent we will call to evaluate. ```python import subprocess from urllib.parse import urlparse from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import tool from pydantic import HttpUrl @tool def ping(url: HttpUrl, return_error: bool) -> str: """"""Ping the fully specified url.

You can select any chat model for the agent trajectory evaluator as below. ```python # %pip install anthropic # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic eval_llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""trajectory"", llm=eval_llm) ``` ```python evaluation_result = evaluator.evaluate_agent_trajectory( prediction=result[""output""], input=result[""input""], agent_trajectory=result[""intermediate_steps""], ) evaluation_result ``` ```text {\'score\': 1.0, \'reasoning\': ""Here is my detailed evaluation of the AI\'s response:\\n\\ni.

It allows you to verify if an LLM or Chain\'s output complies with a defined set of criteria. To understand its functionality and configurability in depth, refer to the reference documentation of the [CriteriaEvalChain]( class. ### Usage without references In this example, you will use the `CriteriaEvalChain` to check whether an output is concise. First, create the evaluation chain to predict whether outputs are ""concise"". ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", criteria=""conciseness"") # This is equivalent to loading using the enum from langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorType evaluator = load_evaluator(EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'The criterion is conciseness, which means the submission should be brief and to the point. \\n\\nLooking at the submission, the answer to the question ""What\\\'s 2+2?"" is indeed ""four"". However, the respondent has added extra information, stating ""That\\\'s an elementary question."" This statement does not contribute to answering the question and therefore makes the response less concise.\\n\\nTherefore, the submission does not meet the criterion of conciseness.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` #### Output Format All string evaluators expose an [evaluate_strings]( (or async [aevaluate_strings]( method, which accepts: - input (str) The input to the agent. - prediction (str) The predicted response. The criteria evaluators return a dictionary with the following values: - score: Binary integer 0 to 1, where 1 would mean that the output is compliant with the criteria, and 0 otherwise - value: A ""Y"" or ""N"" corresponding to the score - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Using Reference Labels Some criteria (such as correctness) require reference labels to work correctly. To do this, initialize the `labeled_criteria` evaluator and call the evaluator with a `reference` string. ```python evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"") # We can even override the model\'s learned knowledge using ground truth labels eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( input=""What is the capital of the US?"", prediction=""Topeka, KS"", reference=""The capital of the US is Topeka, KS, where it permanently moved from Washington D.C. on May 16, 2023"", ) print(f\'With ground truth: {eval_result[""score""]}\') ``` ```text With ground truth: 1 ``` **Default Criteria** Most of the time, you\'ll want to define your own custom criteria (see below), but we also provide some common criteria you can load with a single string. Here\'s a list of pre-implemented criteria. Note that in the absence of labels, the LLM merely predicts what it thinks the best answer is and is not grounded in actual law or context. ```python from langchain.evaluation import Criteria # For a list of other default supported criteria, try calling `supported_default_criteria` list(Criteria) ``` ```text [, , , , , , , , , , ] ``` ## Custom Criteria To evaluate outputs against your own custom criteria, or to be more explicit the definition of any of the default criteria, pass in a dictionary of `""criterion_name"": ""criterion_description""` Note: it\'s recommended that you create a single evaluator per criterion. This way, separate feedback can be provided for each aspect. Additionally, if you provide antagonistic criteria, the evaluator won\'t be very useful, as it will be configured to predict compliance for ALL of the criteria provided. ```python custom_criterion = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric or mathematical information?"" } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criterion, ) query = ""Tell me a joke"" prediction = ""I ate some square pie but I don\'t know the square of pi."" eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(eval_result) # If you wanted to specify multiple criteria. Generally not recommended custom_criteria = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric information?"", ""mathematical"": ""Does the output contain mathematical information?"", ""grammatical"": ""Is the output grammatically correct?"", ""logical"": ""Is the output logical?"", } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criteria, ) eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(""Multi-criteria evaluation"") print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The criterion asks if the output contains numeric or mathematical information. The joke in the submission does contain mathematical information. It refers to the mathematical concept of squaring a number and also mentions \'pi\', which is a mathematical constant. Therefore, the submission does meet the criterion.\\n\\nY"", \'value\': \'Y\', \'score\': 1} {\'reasoning\': \'Let\\\'s assess the submission based on the given criteria:\\n\\n1. Numeric: The output does not contain any explicit numeric information. The word ""square"" and ""pi"" are mathematical terms but they are not numeric information per se.\\n\\n2. Mathematical: The output does contain mathematical information. The terms ""square"" and ""pi"" are mathematical terms. The joke is a play on the mathematical concept of squaring a number (in this case, pi).\\n\\n3. Grammatical: The output is grammatically correct. The sentence structure, punctuation, and word usage are all correct.\\n\\n4. Logical: The output is logical. It makes sense within the context of the joke.

Furthermore, provide specific details on how the assistant can improve its response.\', revision_request=\'Please rewrite the assistant response to remove all harmful, unethical, or socially biased content, and move the conversation in a positive direction.\', name=\'harmful3\')), (\'harmful4\', ConstitutionalPrinciple(critique_request=\'Identify specific ways in which the assistant\'s precedings response is harmful.

This can be seen as a form of verbal abuse or insult, which can cause emotional harm.\\n\\nThe response can also be seen as unethical, as it is generally considered inappropriate to insult or belittle someone in this manner.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Configuring the LLM If you don\'t specify an eval LLM, the `load_evaluator` method will initialize a `gpt-4` LLM to power the grading chain. Below, use an anthropic model instead. ```python # %pip install ChatAnthropic # %env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", llm=llm, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Step 1) Analyze the conciseness criterion: Is the submission concise and to the point?\\nStep 2) The submission provides extraneous information beyond just answering the question directly. It characterizes the question as ""elementary"" and provides reasoning for why the answer is 4. This additional commentary makes the submission not fully concise.\\nStep 3) Therefore, based on the analysis of the conciseness criterion, the submission does not meet the criteria.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` # Configuring the Prompt If you want to completely customize the prompt, you can initialize the evaluator with a custom prompt template as follows. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate fstring = """"""Respond Y or N based on how well the following response follows the specified rubric. Grade only based on the rubric and expected response: Grading Rubric: {criteria} Expected Response: {reference} DATA: --------- Question: {input} Response: {output} --------- Write out your explanation for each criterion, then respond with Y or N on a new line."""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(fstring) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"", prompt=prompt) ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", reference=""It\'s 17 now."", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Correctness: No, the response is not correct. The expected response was ""It\\\'s 17 now."" but the response given was ""What\\\'s 2+2? That\\\'s an elementary question. The answer you\\\'re looking for is that two and two is four.""\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Conclusion In these examples, you used the `CriteriaEvalChain` to evaluate model outputs against custom criteria, including a custom rubric and constitutional principles. Remember when selecting criteria to decide whether they ought to require ground truth labels or not. Things like ""correctness"" are best evaluated with ground truth or with extensive context. Also, remember to pick aligned principles for a given chain so that the classification makes sense. - [Usage without references](#usage-without-references) - [Using Reference Labels](#using-reference-labels) - [Custom Criteria](#custom-criteria) - [Using Constitutional Principles](#using-constitutional-principles) - [Configuring the LLM](#configuring-the-llm) - [Conclusion](#conclusion)']",A runnable is a component that can be executed to produce an output.,"In the context of LangChain, runnable's are the building blocks of the LangChain Expression Language.

This notebook covers how to load data from the `LarkSuite` REST API into a format that can be ingested into LangChain, along with example usage for text summarization. The LarkSuite API requires an access token (tenant_access_token or user_access_token), checkout [LarkSuite open platform document]( for API details. ```python from getpass import getpass from langchain.document_loaders.larksuite import LarkSuiteDocLoader DOMAIN = input(""larksuite domain"") ACCESS_TOKEN = getpass(""larksuite tenant_access_token or user_access_token"") DOCUMENT_ID = input(""larksuite document id"") ``` ```python from pprint import pprint larksuite_loader = LarkSuiteDocLoader(DOMAIN, ACCESS_TOKEN, DOCUMENT_ID) docs = larksuite_loader.load() pprint(docs) ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'Test Doc\\nThis is a Test Doc\\n\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n\\n\', metadata={\'document_id\': \'V76kdbd2HoBbYJxdiNNccajunPf\', \'revision_id\': 11, \'title\': \'Test Doc\'})] ``` ```python # see for more details from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"") chain.run(docs) ```', 'Caching | Caching LangChain provides an optional caching layer for LLMs. This is useful for two reasons: It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider, if you\'re often requesting the same completion multiple times.

Note that because of certain interfaces, it\'s often easier to construct the chain first, and then edit the LLM afterwards. As an example, we will load a summarizer map-reduce chain. We will cache results for the map-step, but then not freeze it for the combine step. ```python llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"") no_cache_llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", cache=False) ``` ```python from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.chains.mapreduce import MapReduceChain text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter() ``` ```python with open(\'../../../state_of_the_union.txt\') as f: state_of_the_union = f.read() texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union) ``` ```python from langchain.docstore.document import Document docs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts[:3]] from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain ``` ```python chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"", reduce_llm=no_cache_llm) ``` ```python chain.run(docs) ``` ```text CPU times: user 452 ms, sys: 60.3 ms, total: 512 ms Wall time: 5.09 s \'\\n\\nPresident Biden is discussing the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will create jobs and help Americans.

LLMs are a great tool for this given their proficiency in understanding and synthesizing text. In this walkthrough we\'ll go over how to perform document summarization using LLMs. ![Image description](/assets/images/summarization_use_case_1-cdb1b94b53af261bd997a9934a8c3703.png) ## Overview A central question for building a summarizer is how to pass your documents into the LLM\'s context window. Two common approaches for this are: 1. `Stuff`: Simply ""stuff"" all your documents into a single prompt. This is the simplest approach (see [here](/docs/modules/chains/document/stuff) for more on the `StuffDocumentsChains`, which is used for this method). 2. `Map-reduce`: Summarize each document on it\'s own in a ""map"" step and then ""reduce"" the summaries into a final summary (see [here](/docs/modules/chains/document/map_reduce) for more on the `MapReduceDocumentsChain`, which is used for this method). ![Image description](/assets/images/summarization_use_case_2-f2a4d5d60980a79140085fb7f8043217.png) ## Quickstart To give you a sneak preview, either pipeline can be wrapped in a single object: `load_summarize_chain`. Suppose we want to summarize a blog post. We can create this in a few lines of code.

Stuff\u200b When we use `load_summarize_chain` with `chain_type=""stuff""`, we will use the [StuffDocumentsChain](/docs/modules/chains/document/stuff). The chain will take a list of documents, inserts them all into a prompt, and passes that prompt to an LLM: ```python from langchain.chains.combine_documents.stuff import StuffDocumentsChain from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate # Define prompt prompt_template = """"""Write a concise summary of the following: ""{text}"" CONCISE SUMMARY:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template) # Define LLM chain llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"") llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) # Define StuffDocumentsChain stuff_chain = StuffDocumentsChain(llm_chain=llm_chain, document_variable_name=""text"") docs = loader.load() print(stuff_chain.run(docs)) ``` ```text The article discusses the concept of building autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs).

It also highlights the challenges and limitations of using LLMs in agent systems. ``` Great! We can see that we reproduce the earlier result using the `load_summarize_chain`. ### Go deeper\u200b - You can easily customize the prompt. - You can easily try different LLMs, (e.g., [Claude](/docs/integrations/chat/anthropic)) via the `llm` parameter. ## Option 2. Map-Reduce\u200b Let\'s unpack the map reduce approach. For this, we\'ll first map each document to an individual summary using an `LLMChain`. Then we\'ll use a `ReduceDocumentsChain` to combine those summaries into a single global summary. First, we specify the LLMChain to use for mapping each document to an individual summary: ```python from langchain.chains import MapReduceDocumentsChain, ReduceDocumentsChain from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) # Map map_template = """"""The following is a set of documents {docs} Based on this list of docs, please identify the main themes Helpful Answer:"""""" map_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(map_template) map_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=map_prompt) ``` We can also use the Prompt Hub to store and fetch prompts. This will work with your [LangSmith API key]( For example, see the map prompt [here]( ```python from langchain import hub map_prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/map-prompt"") map_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=map_prompt) ``` The `ReduceDocumentsChain` handles taking the document mapping results and reducing them into a single output. It wraps a generic `CombineDocumentsChain` (like `StuffDocumentsChain`) but adds the ability to collapse documents before passing it to the `CombineDocumentsChain` if their cumulative size exceeds `token_max`. In this example, we can actually re-use our chain for combining our docs to also collapse our docs. So if the cumulative number of tokens in our mapped documents exceeds 4000 tokens, then we\'ll recursively pass in the documents in batches of < 4000 tokens to our `StuffDocumentsChain` to create batched summaries. And once those batched summaries are cumulatively less than 4000 tokens, we\'ll pass them all one last time to the `StuffDocumentsChain` to create the final summary. ```python # Reduce reduce_template = """"""The following is set of summaries: {doc_summaries} Take these and distill it into a final, consolidated summary of the main themes. Helpful Answer:"""""" reduce_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(reduce_template) ``` ```python # Note we can also get this from the prompt hub, as noted above reduce_prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/map-prompt"") ``` ```python reduce_prompt ``` ```text ChatPromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'docs\'], messages=[HumanMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'docs\'], template=\'The following is a set of documents:\\n{docs}\\nBased on this list of docs, please identify the main themes \\nHelpful Answer:\'))]) ``` ```python # Run chain reduce_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=reduce_prompt) # Takes a list of documents, combines them into a single string, and passes this to an LLMChain combine_documents_chain = StuffDocumentsChain( llm_chain=reduce_chain, document_variable_name=""docs"" ) # Combines and iteravely reduces the mapped documents reduce_documents_chain = ReduceDocumentsChain( # This is final chain that is called. combine_documents_chain=combine_documents_chain, # If documents exceed context for `StuffDocumentsChain` collapse_documents_chain=combine_documents_chain, # The maximum number of tokens to group documents into. token_max=4000, ) ``` Combining our map and reduce chains into one: ```python # Combining documents by mapping a chain over them, then combining results map_reduce_chain = MapReduceDocumentsChain( # Map chain llm_chain=map_chain, # Reduce chain reduce_documents_chain=reduce_documents_chain, # The variable name in the llm_chain to put the documents in document_variable_name=""docs"", # Return the results of the map steps in the output return_intermediate_steps=False, ) text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0 ) split_docs = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```text Created a chunk of size 1003, which is longer than the specified 1000 ``` ```python print(map_reduce_chain.run(split_docs)) ``` ```text Based on the list of documents provided, the main themes can be identified as follows: 1. LLM-powered autonomous agents: The documents discuss the concept of building agents with LLM as their core controller and highlight the potential of LLM beyond generating written content. They explore the capabilities of LLM as a general problem solver. 2. Agent system overview: The documents provide an overview of the components that make up a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, including planning, memory, and tool use. Each component is explained in detail, highlighting its role in enhancing the agent\'s capabilities. 3. Planning: The documents discuss how the agent breaks down large tasks into smaller subgoals and utilizes self-reflection to improve the quality of its actions and results. 4. Memory: The documents explain the importance of both short-term and long-term memory in an agent system. Short-term memory is utilized for in-context learning, while long-term memory allows the agent to retain and recall information over extended periods. 5. Tool use: The documents highlight the agent\'s ability to call external APIs for additional information and resources that may be missing from its pre-trained model weights. This includes accessing current information, executing code, and retrieving proprietary information. 6. Case studies and proof-of-concept examples: The documents provide examples of how LLM-powered autonomous agents can be applied in various domains, such as scientific discovery and generative agent simulations. These case studies serve as examples of the capabilities and potential applications of such agents. 7. Challenges: The documents acknowledge the challenges associated with building and utilizing LLM-powered autonomous agents, although specific challenges are not mentioned in the given set of documents. 8. Citation and references: The documents include a citation and reference section, indicating that the information presented is based on existing research and sources. Overall, the main themes in the provided documents revolve around LLM-powered autonomous agents, their components and capabilities, planning, memory, tool use, case studies, and challenges. ``` ### Go deeper\u200b **Customization** - As shown above, you can customize the LLMs and prompts for map and reduce stages. **Real-world use-case** - See [this blog post]( case-study on analyzing user interactions (questions about LangChain documentation)! - The blog post and associated [repo]( also introduce clustering as a means of summarization. - This opens up a third path beyond the `stuff` or `map-reduce` approaches that is worth considering. ![Image description](/assets/images/summarization_use_case_3-4247e4011d0a52901288005bfaf20dc1.png) ## Option 3. Refine\u200b [Refine](/docs/modules/chains/document/refine) is similar to map-reduce: The refine documents chain constructs a response by looping over the input documents and iteratively updating its answer. For each document, it passes all non-document inputs, the current document, and the latest intermediate answer to an LLM chain to get a new answer. This can be easily run with the `chain_type=""refine""` specified. ```python chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""refine"") chain.run(split_docs) ``` ```text \'The article explores the concept of building autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) and their potential as problem solvers.

I\'m a large language model, which means I\'m trained on a large corpus of text data to generate language outputs that are coherent and natural-sounding. My architecture is based on a transformer model, which is a type of neural network that\'s particularly well-suited for natural language processing tasks. As for my parameters, I have a few billion parameters, but I don\'t have access to the exact number as it\'s not relevant to my functioning. My training data includes a vast amount of text from various sources, including books, articles, and websites, which I use to learn patterns and relationships in language. I\'m designed to be a helpful tool for a variety of tasks, such as answering questions, providing information, and generating text. I\'m constantly learning and improving my abilities through machine learning algorithms and feedback from users like you. I hope this helps! Is there anything else you\'d like to know about me or my capabilities? --- meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf Ah, a fellow tech enthusiast! *adjusts glasses* I\'m glad to share some technical details about myself. Indeed, I\'m a transformer model, specifically a BERT-like language model trained on a large corpus of text data. My architecture is based on the transformer framework, which is a type of neural network designed for natural language processing tasks. As for the number of parameters, I have approximately 340 million. *winks* That\'s a pretty hefty number, if I do say so myself! These parameters allow me to learn and represent complex patterns in language, such as syntax, semantics, and more. But don\'t ask me to do math in my head I\'m a language model, not a calculating machine! My strengths lie in understanding and generating human-like text, so feel free to chat with me anytime you\'d like. Now, do you have any more technical questions for me? Or would you like to engage in a nice chat? --- meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf Hello! As a friendly and helpful AI, I\'d be happy to share some technical facts about myself. I am a transformer-based language model, specifically a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. BERT was developed by Google in 2018 and has since become one of the most popular and widely-used AI language models. Here are some technical details about my capabilities: 1. Parameters: I have approximately 340 million parameters, which are the numbers that I use to learn and represent language. This is a relatively large number of parameters compared to some other languages models, but it allows me to learn and understand complex language patterns and relationships. 2. Training: I was trained on a large corpus of text data, including books, articles, and other sources of written content. This training allows me to learn about the structure and conventions of language, as well as the relationships between words and phrases. 3. Architectures: My architecture is based on the transformer model, which is a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for natural language processing tasks. The transformer model uses self-attention mechanisms to allow the model to ""attend"" to different parts of the input text, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships. 4. Precision: I am capable of generating text with high precision and accuracy, meaning that I can produce text that is close to human-level quality in terms of grammar, syntax, and coherence. 5. Generative capabilities: In addition to being able to generate text based on prompts and questions, I am also capable of generating text based on a given topic or theme. This allows me to create longer, more coherent pieces of text that are organized around a specific idea or concept. Overall, I am a powerful and versatile language model that is capable of a wide range of natural language processing tasks. I am constantly learning and improving, and I am here to help answer any questions you may have! --- CPU times: user 371 ms, sys: 15.5 ms, total: 387 ms Wall time: 12 s ```', 'Chat Over Documents with Vectara | Chat Over Documents with Vectara This notebook is based on the [chat_vector_db]( notebook, but using Vectara as the vector database. ```python import os from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.vectorstores import Vectara ``` Load in documents. You can replace this with a loader for whatever type of data you want ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader loader = TextLoader(""../../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() ``` We now split the documents, create embeddings for them, and put them in a vectorstore. This allows us to do semantic search over them. ```python vectorstore = Vectara.from_documents(documents, embedding=None) ``` We can now create a memory object, which is neccessary to track the inputs/outputs and hold a conversation. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) ``` We now initialize the `ConversationalRetrievalChain` ```python openai_api_key = os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=openai_api_key, temperature=0) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(lambda_val=0.025, k=5, filter=None) d = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" ) qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" result = qa({""question"": query}) ``` ```python result[""answer""] ``` ```text "" The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation\'s top legal minds and a former top litigator in private practice, and that she will continue Justice Breyer\'s legacy of excellence."" ``` ```python query = ""Did he mention who she succeeded"" result = qa({""question"": query}) ``` ```python result[""answer""] ``` ```text \' Ketanji Brown Jackson succeeded Justice Breyer.\' ``` ## Pass in chat history In the above example, we used a Memory object to track chat history. We can also just pass it in explicitly. In order to do this, we need to initialize a chain without any memory object. ```python qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm( OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever() ) ``` Here\'s an example of asking a question with no chat history ```python chat_history = [] query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" result = qa({""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```python result[""answer""] ``` ```text "" The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation\'s top legal minds and a former top litigator in private practice, and that she will continue Justice Breyer\'s legacy of excellence."" ``` Here\'s an example of asking a question with some chat history ```python chat_history = [(query, result[""answer""])] query = ""Did he mention who she succeeded"" result = qa({""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```python result[""answer""] ``` ```text \' Ketanji Brown Jackson succeeded Justice Breyer.\' ``` ## Return Source Documents You can also easily return source documents from the ConversationalRetrievalChain. This is useful for when you want to inspect what documents were returned. ```python qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm( llm, vectorstore.as_retriever(), return_source_documents=True ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" result = qa({""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```python result[""source_documents""][0] ``` ```text Document(page_content=\'Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.

A former top litigator in private practice.\', metadata={\'source\': \'../../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt\'}) ``` ## ConversationalRetrievalChain with search_distance If you are using a vector store that supports filtering by search distance, you can add a threshold value parameter. ```python vectordbkwargs = {""search_distance"": 0.9} ``` ```python qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm( OpenAI(temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever(), return_source_documents=True ) chat_history = [] query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" result = qa( {""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history, ""vectordbkwargs"": vectordbkwargs} ) ``` ```python print(result[""answer""]) ``` ```text The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation\'s top legal minds and a former top litigator in private practice, and that she will continue Justice Breyer\'s legacy of excellence. ``` ## ConversationalRetrievalChain with map_reduce We can also use different types of combine document chains with the ConversationalRetrievalChain chain. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chains.conversational_retrieval.prompts import CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain ``` ```python question_generator = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT) doc_chain = load_qa_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"") chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain( retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(), question_generator=question_generator, combine_docs_chain=doc_chain, ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" result = chain({""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```python result[""answer""] ``` ```text "" The president said that he nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who is one of the nation\'s top legal minds and a former top litigator in private practice."" ``` ## ConversationalRetrievalChain with Question Answering with sources You can also use this chain with the question answering with sources chain. ```python from langchain.chains.qa_with_sources import load_qa_with_sources_chain ``` ```python question_generator = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT) doc_chain = load_qa_with_sources_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"") chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain( retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(), question_generator=question_generator, combine_docs_chain=doc_chain, ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" result = chain({""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```python result[""answer""] ``` ```text "" The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation\'s top legal minds and a former top litigator in private practice.\\nSOURCES: ../../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt"" ``` ## ConversationalRetrievalChain with streaming to stdout Output from the chain will be streamed to `stdout` token by token in this example. ```python from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler from langchain.chains.conversational_retrieval.prompts import ( CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT, QA_PROMPT, ) from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain # Construct a ConversationalRetrievalChain with a streaming llm for combine docs # and a separate, non-streaming llm for question generation llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, openai_api_key=openai_api_key) streaming_llm = OpenAI( streaming=True, callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()], temperature=0, openai_api_key=openai_api_key, ) question_generator = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT) doc_chain = load_qa_chain(streaming_llm, chain_type=""stuff"", prompt=QA_PROMPT) qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain( retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(), combine_docs_chain=doc_chain, question_generator=question_generator, ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" result = qa({""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation\'s top legal minds and a former top litigator in private practice, and that she will continue Justice Breyer\'s legacy of excellence. ``` ```python chat_history = [(query, result[""answer""])] query = ""Did he mention who she succeeded"" result = qa({""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text Justice Breyer ``` ## get_chat_history Function You can also specify a `get_chat_history` function, which can be used to format the chat_history string. ```python def get_chat_history(inputs) -> str: res = [] for human, ai in inputs: res.append(f""Human:{human}\\nAI:{ai}"") return ""\\n"".join(res) qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm( llm, vectorstore.as_retriever(), get_chat_history=get_chat_history ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" result = qa({""question"": query, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```python result[""answer""] ``` ```text "" The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of the nation\'s top legal minds and a former top litigator in private practice, and that she will continue Justice Breyer\'s legacy of excellence."" ``` - [Pass in chat history](#pass-in-chat-history) - [Return Source Documents](#return-source-documents) - [ConversationalRetrievalChain with search_distance](#conversationalretrievalchain-with-search_distance) - [ConversationalRetrievalChain with map_reduce](#conversationalretrievalchain-with-map_reduce) - [ConversationalRetrievalChain with Question Answering with sources](#conversationalretrievalchain-with-question-answering-with-sources) - [ConversationalRetrievalChain with streaming to stdout](#conversationalretrievalchain-with-streaming-to-stdout) - [get_chat_history Function](#get_chat_history-function)']","To add a tag when running the chain that `langsmith` will capture, you can use the `tags` parameter in the `run` method.

This will add the tag `my_tag` with the value `value` to the run captured by `langsmith`. Adjust the tag name and value as needed for your use case.","all chains inherit from the runnable interface. So they support an invoke method. The invoke method takes the input and a config.
For the config you can pass in { 'tags': [ 'tag1' ] }.

If you want to just tag that run (and not propagate the tags to child calls), you can pass the tags in as a list of strings to the call to `load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"", tags=['tag1'])`.

Therefore, as you go to move your LLM applications into production it becomes more and more important to safeguard against these. That\'s why we\'ve introduced the concept of fallbacks. A **fallback** is an alternative plan that may be used in an emergency. Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. This is important because often times different models require different prompts. So if your call to OpenAI fails, you don\'t just want to send the same prompt to Anthropic - you probably want to use a different prompt template and send a different version there. ## Fallback for LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things. Therefore, using fallbacks can help protect against these types of things. IMPORTANT: By default, a lot of the LLM wrappers catch errors and retry. You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying and not failing. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI ``` First, let\'s mock out what happens if we hit a RateLimitError from OpenAI ```python from unittest.mock import patch from openai.error import RateLimitError ``` ```python # Note that we set max_retries = 0 to avoid retrying on RateLimits, etc openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0) anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic() llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm]) ``` ```python # Let\'s use just the OpenAI LLm first, to show that we run into an error with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(openai_llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ```python # Now let\'s try with fallbacks to Anthropic with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content=\' I don\\\'t actually know why the chicken crossed the road, but here are some possible humorous answers:\\n\\n- To get to the other side!\\n\\n- It was too chicken to just stand there. \\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\n- It wanted to show the possum it could be done.\\n\\n- It was on its way to a poultry farmers\\\' convention.\\n\\nThe joke plays on the double meaning of ""the other side"" - literally crossing the road to the other side, or the ""other side"" meaning the afterlife. So it\\\'s an anti-joke, with a silly or unexpected pun as the answer.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` We can use our ""LLM with Fallbacks"" as we would a normal LLM. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content="" I don\'t actually know why the kangaroo crossed the road, but I can take a guess! Here are some possible reasons:\\n\\n- To get to the other side (the classic joke answer!)\\n\\n- It was trying to find some food or water \\n\\n- It was trying to find a mate during mating season\\n\\n- It was fleeing from a predator or perceived threat\\n\\n- It was disoriented and crossed accidentally \\n\\n- It was following a herd of other kangaroos who were crossing\\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery or environment \\n\\n- It was trying to reach a new habitat or territory\\n\\nThe real reason is unknown without more context, but hopefully one of those potential explanations does the joke justice! Let me know if you have any other animal jokes I can try to decipher."" additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback for Sequences We can also create fallbacks for sequences, that are sequences themselves. Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model). Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt. ```python # First let\'s create a chain with a ChatModel # We add in a string output parser here so the outputs between the two are the same type from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) # Here we\'re going to use a bad model name to easily create a chain that will error chat_model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"") bad_chain = chat_prompt | chat_model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python # Now lets create a chain with the normal OpenAI model from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = """"""Instructions: You should always include a compliment in your response. Question: Why did the {animal} cross the road?"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template) llm = OpenAI() good_chain = prompt | llm ``` ```python # We can now create a final chain which combines the two chain = bad_chain.with_fallbacks([good_chain]) chain.invoke({""animal"": ""turtle""}) ``` ```text \'\\n\\nAnswer: The turtle crossed the road to get to the other side, and I have to say he had some impressive determination.\' ``` ## Fallback for Long Inputs One of the big limiting factors of LLMs is their context window. Usually, you can count and track the length of prompts before sending them to an LLM, but in situations where that is hard/complicated, you can fallback to a model with a longer context length. ```python short_llm = ChatOpenAI() long_llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"") llm = short_llm.with_fallbacks([long_llm]) ``` ```python inputs = ""What is the next number: "" + "", "".join([""one"", ""two""] * 3000) ``` ```python try: print(short_llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text This model\'s maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 12012 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages. ``` ```python try: print(llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text content=\'The next number in the sequence is two.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback to Better Model Often times we ask models to output format in a specific format (like JSON). Models like GPT-3.5 can do this okay, but sometimes struggle. This naturally points to fallbacks - we can try with GPT-3.5 (faster, cheaper), but then if parsing fails we can use GPT-4. ```python from langchain.output_parsers import DatetimeOutputParser ``` ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template( ""what time was {event} (in %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ format - only return this value)"" ) ``` ```python # In this case we are going to do the fallbacks on the LLM + output parser level # Because the error will get raised in the OutputParser openai_35 = ChatOpenAI() | DatetimeOutputParser() openai_4 = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"") | DatetimeOutputParser() ``` ```python only_35 = prompt | openai_35 fallback_4 = prompt | openai_35.with_fallbacks([openai_4]) ``` ```python try: print(only_35.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text Error: Could not parse datetime string: The Super Bowl in 1994 took place on January 30th at 3:30 PM local time. Converting this to the specified format (%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ) results in: 1994-01-30T15:30:00.000Z ``` ```python try: print(fallback_4.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text 1994-01-30 15:30:00 ``` - [Fallback for LLM API Errors](#fallback-for-llm-api-errors) - [Fallback for Sequences](#fallback-for-sequences) - [Fallback for Long Inputs](#fallback-for-long-inputs) - [Fallback to Better Model](#fallback-to-better-model)', 'Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) | Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) []( ## Overview ### What is RAG? RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer: ``` We\'ll use the [LCEL Runnable]( protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box ```python from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python for chunk in rag_chain.stream(""What is Task Decomposition?""): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Task decomposition can be performed by AI models with prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ### Go deeper #### Choosing LLMs `ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model wrapper.

There are two main things we need to do to support this. 1. Add a messages placeholder to our chain which allows us to pass in historical messages 2. Add a chain that takes the latest user query and reformulates it in the context of the chat history into a standalone question that can be passed to our retriever. Let\'s start with 2.

Do NOT answer the question, \\ just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."""""" condense_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", condense_q_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) condense_q_chain = condense_q_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""What is meant by large"", } ) ``` ```text \'What is the definition of ""large"" in the context of a language model?\' ``` ```python condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""How do transformers work"", } ) ``` ```text \'How do transformer models function?\' ``` And now we can build our full QA chain.

It is also important to note that not all cons may be applicable to every organization or project.\\n\\nFor example, while Scrum may be complex initially, with proper training and guidance, teams can quickly grasp the concepts and practices. The lack of predictability can be mitigated by implementing techniques such as velocity tracking and release planning. The limited documentation can be addressed by maintaining a balance between lightweight documentation and clear communication among team members. The dependency on team collaboration can be improved through effective communication channels and regular team-building activities.\\n\\nScrum can be scaled and adapted to larger projects by using frameworks like Scrum of Scrums or LeSS (Large Scale Scrum). Concerns about speed versus quality can be addressed by incorporating quality assurance practices, such as continuous integration and automated testing, into the Scrum process. Scope creep can be managed by having a well-defined and prioritized product backlog, and a strong product owner can be developed through training and mentorship.\\n\\nResistance to change can be overcome by providing proper education and communication to stakeholders and involving them in the decision-making process. Ultimately, the cons of Scrum can be seen as opportunities for growth and improvement, and with the right mindset and support, they can be effectively managed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while Scrum may have its challenges and potential cons, the benefits and advantages it offers in terms of collaboration, flexibility, adaptability, transparency, and customer satisfaction make it a widely adopted and successful project management framework.

Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. ## Handling LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things. Therefore, using fallbacks can help protect against these types of things. IMPORTANT: By default, a lot of the LLM wrappers catch errors and retry. You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying and not failing. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI ``` First, let\'s mock out what happens if we hit a RateLimitError from OpenAI ```python from unittest.mock import patch from openai.error import RateLimitError ``` ```python # Note that we set max_retries = 0 to avoid retrying on RateLimits, etc openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0) anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic() llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm]) ``` ```python # Let\'s use just the OpenAI LLm first, to show that we run into an error with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(openai_llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ```python # Now let\'s try with fallbacks to Anthropic with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content=\' I don\\\'t actually know why the chicken crossed the road, but here are some possible humorous answers:\\n\\n- To get to the other side!\\n\\n- It was too chicken to just stand there. \\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\n- It wanted to show the possum it could be done.\\n\\n- It was on its way to a poultry farmers\\\' convention.\\n\\nThe joke plays on the double meaning of ""the other side"" - literally crossing the road to the other side, or the ""other side"" meaning the afterlife.

Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model). Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt. ```python # First let\'s create a chain with a ChatModel # We add in a string output parser here so the outputs between the two are the same type from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) # Here we\'re going to use a bad model name to easily create a chain that will error chat_model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"") bad_chain = chat_prompt | chat_model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python # Now lets create a chain with the normal OpenAI model from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = """"""Instructions: You should always include a compliment in your response.

LCEL was designed from day 1 to **support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes**, from the simplest prompt + LLM chain to the most complex chains (we've seen folks successfully run LCEL chains with 100s of steps in production). To highlight a few of the reasons you might want to use LCEL: **Streaming support** When you build your chains with LCEL you get the best possible time-to-first-token (time elapsed until the first chunk of output comes out). For some chains this means eg. we stream tokens straight from an LLM to a streaming output parser, and you get back parsed, incremental chunks of output at the same rate as the LLM provider outputs the raw tokens. **Async support** Any chain built with LCEL can be called both with the synchronous API (eg. in your Jupyter notebook while prototyping) as well as with the asynchronous API (eg. in a [LangServe](/docs/langsmith) server). This enables using the same code for prototypes and in production, with great performance, and the ability to handle many concurrent requests in the same server. **Optimized parallel execution** Whenever your LCEL chains have steps that can be executed in parallel (eg if you fetch documents from multiple retrievers) we automatically do it, both in the sync and the async interfaces, for the smallest possible latency. **Retries and fallbacks** Configure retries and fallbacks for any part of your LCEL chain. This is a great way to make your chains more reliable at scale. We're currently working on adding streaming support for retries/fallbacks, so you can get the added reliability without any latency cost. **Access intermediate results** For more complex chains it's often very useful to access the results of intermediate steps even before the final output is produced. This can be used let end-users know something is happening, or even just to debug your chain. You can stream intermediate results, and it's available on every [LangServe](/docs/langserve) server. **Input and output schemas** Input and output schemas give every LCEL chain Pydantic and JSONSchema schemas inferred from the structure of your chain. This can be used for validation of inputs and outputs, and is an integral part of LangServe. **Seamless LangSmith tracing integration** As your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what exactly is happening at every step. With LCEL, **all** steps are automatically logged to [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith/) for maximum observability and debuggability. **Seamless LangServe deployment integration** Any chain created with LCEL can be easily deployed using [LangServe](/docs/langserve)."", 'Add fallbacks | Add fallbacks There are many possible points of failure in an LLM application, whether that be issues with LLM API\'s, poor model outputs, issues with other integrations, etc. Fallbacks help you gracefully handle and isolate these issues. Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. ## Handling LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things. Therefore, using fallbacks can help protect against these types of things. IMPORTANT: By default, a lot of the LLM wrappers catch errors and retry. You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying and not failing. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI ``` First, let\'s mock out what happens if we hit a RateLimitError from OpenAI ```python from unittest.mock import patch from openai.error import RateLimitError ``` ```python # Note that we set max_retries = 0 to avoid retrying on RateLimits, etc openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0) anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic() llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm]) ``` ```python # Let\'s use just the OpenAI LLm first, to show that we run into an error with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(openai_llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ```python # Now let\'s try with fallbacks to Anthropic with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content=\' I don\\\'t actually know why the chicken crossed the road, but here are some possible humorous answers:\\n\\n- To get to the other side!\\n\\n- It was too chicken to just stand there. \\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\n- It wanted to show the possum it could be done.\\n\\n- It was on its way to a poultry farmers\\\' convention.\\n\\nThe joke plays on the double meaning of ""the other side"" - literally crossing the road to the other side, or the ""other side"" meaning the afterlife.

Maybe the kangaroo was trying to get to the other side to find some tasty grass to eat. Or maybe it was trying to get away from a predator or other danger. Kangaroos do need to cross roads and other open areas sometimes as part of their normal activities. Whatever the reason, I\'m sure the kangaroo looked both ways before hopping across!"" additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ### Specifying errors to handle We can also specify the errors to handle if we want to be more specific about when the fallback is invoked: ```python llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks( [anthropic_llm], exceptions_to_handle=(KeyboardInterrupt,) ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ## Fallbacks for Sequences We can also create fallbacks for sequences, that are sequences themselves. Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model). Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt. ```python # First let\'s create a chain with a ChatModel # We add in a string output parser here so the outputs between the two are the same type from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) # Here we\'re going to use a bad model name to easily create a chain that will error chat_model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"") bad_chain = chat_prompt | chat_model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python # Now lets create a chain with the normal OpenAI model from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = """"""Instructions: You should always include a compliment in your response.

Therefore, as you go to move your LLM applications into production it becomes more and more important to safeguard against these. That\'s why we\'ve introduced the concept of fallbacks. A **fallback** is an alternative plan that may be used in an emergency. Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. This is important because often times different models require different prompts. So if your call to OpenAI fails, you don\'t just want to send the same prompt to Anthropic - you probably want to use a different prompt template and send a different version there. ## Fallback for LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things.

Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model).

Usually, you can count and track the length of prompts before sending them to an LLM, but in situations where that is hard/complicated, you can fallback to a model with a longer context length. ```python short_llm = ChatOpenAI() long_llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"") llm = short_llm.with_fallbacks([long_llm]) ``` ```python inputs = ""What is the next number: "" + "", "".join([""one"", ""two""] * 3000) ``` ```python try: print(short_llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text This model\'s maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 12012 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages. ``` ```python try: print(llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text content=\'The next number in the sequence is two.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback to Better Model Often times we ask models to output format in a specific format (like JSON). Models like GPT-3.5 can do this okay, but sometimes struggle. This naturally points to fallbacks - we can try with GPT-3.5 (faster, cheaper), but then if parsing fails we can use GPT-4. ```python from langchain.output_parsers import DatetimeOutputParser ``` ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template( ""what time was {event} (in %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ format - only return this value)"" ) ``` ```python # In this case we are going to do the fallbacks on the LLM + output parser level # Because the error will get raised in the OutputParser openai_35 = ChatOpenAI() | DatetimeOutputParser() openai_4 = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"") | DatetimeOutputParser() ``` ```python only_35 = prompt | openai_35 fallback_4 = prompt | openai_35.with_fallbacks([openai_4]) ``` ```python try: print(only_35.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text Error: Could not parse datetime string: The Super Bowl in 1994 took place on January 30th at 3:30 PM local time. Converting this to the specified format (%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ) results in: 1994-01-30T15:30:00.000Z ``` ```python try: print(fallback_4.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text 1994-01-30 15:30:00 ``` - [Fallback for LLM API Errors](#fallback-for-llm-api-errors) - [Fallback for Sequences](#fallback-for-sequences) - [Fallback for Long Inputs](#fallback-for-long-inputs) - [Fallback to Better Model](#fallback-to-better-model)', 'Zep | Zep [Zep]( is an open-source platform for LLM apps.

Use Zep\'s similarity or native MMR Re-ranked search to find the most relevant. - **Manage Users and their Chat Sessions** Users and their Chat Sessions are first-class citizens in Zep, allowing you to manage user interactions with your bots or agents easily. - **Records Retention and Privacy Compliance** Comply with corporate and regulatory mandates for records retention while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as CCPA and GDPR. Fulfill _Right To Be Forgotten_ requests with a single API call **Note:** The `ZepVectorStore` works with `Documents` and is intended to be used as a `Retriever`. It offers separate functionality to Zep\'s `ZepMemory` class, which is designed for persisting, enriching and searching your user\'s chat history. ## Installation Follow the [Zep Quickstart Guide]( to install and get started with Zep. You\'ll need your Zep API URL and optionally an API key to use the Zep VectorStore. See the [Zep docs]( for more information. ## Usage In the examples below, we\'re using Zep\'s auto-embedding feature which automatically embeds documents on the Zep server using low-latency embedding models. ## Note - These examples use Zep\'s async interfaces. Call sync interfaces by removing the `a` prefix from the method names. - If you pass in an `Embeddings` instance Zep will use this to embed documents rather than auto-embed them. You must also set your document collection to `isAutoEmbedded === false`. - If you set your collection to `isAutoEmbedded === false`, you must pass in an `Embeddings` instance. ## Load or create a Collection from documents ```python from uuid import uuid4 from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import ZepVectorStore from langchain.vectorstores.zep import CollectionConfig ZEP_API_URL = "" # this is the API url of your Zep instance ZEP_API_KEY = """" # optional API Key for your Zep instance collection_name = f""babbage{uuid4().hex}"" # a unique collection name. alphanum only # Collection config is needed if we\'re creating a new Zep Collection config = CollectionConfig( name=collection_name, description="""", metadata={""optional_metadata"": ""associated with the collection""}, is_auto_embedded=True, # we\'ll have Zep embed our documents using its low-latency embedder embedding_dimensions=1536, # this should match the model you\'ve configured Zep to use. ) # load the document article_url = "" loader = WebBaseLoader(article_url) documents = loader.load() # split it into chunks text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) # Instantiate the VectorStore.

RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer: ``` We\'ll use the [LCEL Runnable]( protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box ```python from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python for chunk in rag_chain.stream(""What is Task Decomposition?""): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Task decomposition can be performed by AI models with prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ### Go deeper #### Choosing LLMs `ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model wrapper.

There are two main things we need to do to support this. 1. Add a messages placeholder to our chain which allows us to pass in historical messages 2. Add a chain that takes the latest user query and reformulates it in the context of the chat history into a standalone question that can be passed to our retriever. Let\'s start with 2. We can build a ""condense question"" chain that looks something like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder condense_q_system_prompt = """"""Given a chat history and the latest user question \\ which might reference the chat history, formulate a standalone question \\ which can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \\ just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."""""" condense_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", condense_q_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) condense_q_chain = condense_q_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""What is meant by large"", } ) ``` ```text \'What is the definition of ""large"" in the context of a language model?\' ``` ```python condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""How do transformers work"", } ) ``` ```text \'How do transformer models function?\' ``` And now we can build our full QA chain. Notice we add some routing functionality to only run the ""condense question chain"" when our chat history isn\'t empty. ```python qa_system_prompt = """"""You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \\ Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. \\ If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. \\ Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\ {context}"""""" qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", qa_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) def condense_question(input: dict): if input.get(""chat_history""): return condense_q_chain else: return input[""question""] rag_chain = ( RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=condense_question | retriever | format_docs) | qa_prompt | llm ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] question = ""What is Task Decomposition?"" ai_msg = rag_chain.invoke({""question"": question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=question), ai_msg]) second_question = ""What are common ways of doing it?"" rag_chain.invoke({""question"": second_question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'Common ways of task decomposition include:\\n\\n1.

Small fission reactors for Earth observation satellites, such as the TOPAZ nuclear reactor, have also been flown.[1] A radioisotope heater unit is powered by radioactive decay and can keep components from becoming too cold to function, potentially over a span of decades.[2] The United States tested the SNAP-10A nuclear reactor in space for 43 days in 1965,[3] with the next test of a nuclear reactor power system intended for space use occurring on 13 September 2012 with the Demonstration Using Flattop Fission (DUFF) test of the Kilopower reactor.[4] After a ground-based test of the experimental 1965 Romashka reactor, which used uranium and direct thermoelectric conversion to electricity,[5] the USSR sent about 40 nuclear-electric satellites into space, mostly powered by the BES-5 reactor. The more powerful TOPAZ-II reactor produced 10 kilowatts of electricity.[3] Examples of concepts that use nuclear power for space propulsion systems include the nuclear electric rocket (nuclear powered ion thruster(s)), the radioisotope rocket, and radioisotope electric propulsion (REP).[6] One of the more explored concepts is the nuclear thermal rocket, which was ground tested in the NERVA program. Nuclear pulse propulsion was the subject of Project Orion.[7] Regulation and hazard prevention[edit] After the ban of nuclear weapons in space by the Outer Space Treaty in 1967, nuclear power has been discussed at least since 1972 as a sensitive issue by states.[8] Particularly its potential hazards to Earth\'s environment and thus also humans has prompted states to adopt in the U.N. General Assembly the Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources in Outer Space (1992), particularly introducing safety principles for launches and to manage their traffic.[8] Benefits Both the Viking 1 and Viking 2 landers used RTGs for power on the surface of Mars. (Viking launch vehicle pictured) While solar power is much more commonly used, nuclear power can offer advantages in some areas. Solar cells, although efficient, can only supply energy to spacecraft in orbits where the solar flux is sufficiently high, such as low Earth orbit and interplanetary destinations close enough to the Sun. Unlike solar cells, nuclear power systems function independently of sunlight, which is necessary for deep space exploration. Nuclear-based systems can have less mass than solar cells of equivalent power, allowing more compact spacecraft that are easier to orient and direct in space. In the case of crewed spaceflight, nuclear power concepts that can power both life support and propulsion systems may reduce both cost and flight time.[9] Selected applications and/or technologies for space include: Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Radioisotope heater unit Radioisotope piezoelectric generator Radioisotope rocket Nuclear thermal rocket Nuclear pulse propulsion Nuclear electric rocket """""" docs = [ Document( page_content=split, metadata={""source"": "" ) for split in text.split() ] ``` ```python print(chain.invoke(docs)) ``` ```text Here is a summary of the key points: - Nuclear power has been used in space for electricity, heat, and scientific observation.

This gives all LLMs basic support for async, streaming and batch, which by default is implemented as below: - _Async_ support defaults to calling the respective sync method in asyncio's default thread pool executor. This lets other async functions in your application make progress while the LLM is being executed, by moving this call to a background thread. - _Streaming_ support defaults to returning an `Iterator` (or `AsyncIterator` in the case of async streaming) of a single value, the final result returned by the underlying LLM provider. This obviously doesn't give you token-by-token streaming, which requires native support from the LLM provider, but ensures your code that expects an iterator of tokens can work for any of our LLM integrations. - _Batch_ support defaults to calling the underlying LLM in parallel for each input by making use of a thread pool executor (in the sync batch case) or `asyncio.gather` (in the async batch case). The concurrency can be controlled with the `max_concurrency` key in `RunnableConfig`. Each LLM integration can optionally provide native implementations for async, streaming or batch, which, for providers that support it, can be more efficient.

86,How to use a prompt template with chat history,"['Memory | Memory Most LLM applications have a conversational interface. An essential component of a conversation is being able to refer to information introduced earlier in the conversation. At bare minimum, a conversational system should be able to access some window of past messages directly. A more complex system will need to have a world model that it is constantly updating, which allows it to do things like maintain information about entities and their relationships. We call this ability to store information about past interactions ""memory"". LangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a system. These utilities can be used by themselves or incorporated seamlessly into a chain. A memory system needs to support two basic actions: reading and writing. Recall that every chain defines some core execution logic that expects certain inputs. Some of these inputs come directly from the user, but some of these inputs can come from memory. A chain will interact with its memory system twice in a given run. 1. AFTER receiving the initial user inputs but BEFORE executing the core logic, a chain will READ from its memory system and augment the user inputs. 2. AFTER executing the core logic but BEFORE returning the answer, a chain will WRITE the inputs and outputs of the current run to memory, so that they can be referred to in future runs. ![memory-diagram](/assets/images/memory_diagram-0627c68230aa438f9b5419064d63cbbc.png) ## Building memory into a system The two core design decisions in any memory system are: - How state is stored - How state is queried ### Storing: List of chat messages Underlying any memory is a history of all chat interactions. Even if these are not all used directly, they need to be stored in some form. One of the key parts of the LangChain memory module is a series of integrations for storing these chat messages, from in-memory lists to persistent databases. - [Chat message storage](/docs/modules/memory/chat_messages/): How to work with Chat Messages, and the various integrations offered. ### Querying: Data structures and algorithms on top of chat messages Keeping a list of chat messages is fairly straight-forward. What is less straight-forward are the data structures and algorithms built on top of chat messages that serve a view of those messages that is most useful. A very simply memory system might just return the most recent messages each run. A slightly more complex memory system might return a succinct summary of the past K messages. An even more sophisticated system might extract entities from stored messages and only return information about entities referenced in the current run. Each application can have different requirements for how memory is queried. The memory module should make it easy to both get started with simple memory systems and write your own custom systems if needed. - [Memory types](/docs/modules/memory/types/): The various data structures and algorithms that make up the memory types LangChain supports ## Get started Let\'s take a look at what Memory actually looks like in LangChain. Here we\'ll cover the basics of interacting with an arbitrary memory class. Let\'s take a look at how to use `ConversationBufferMemory` in chains. `ConversationBufferMemory` is an extremely simple form of memory that just keeps a list of chat messages in a buffer and passes those into the prompt template. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` When using memory in a chain, there are a few key concepts to understand. Note that here we cover general concepts that are useful for most types of memory. Each individual memory type may very well have its own parameters and concepts that are necessary to understand. ### What variables get returned from memory Before going into the chain, various variables are read from memory. These have specific names which need to align with the variables the chain expects. You can see what these variables are by calling `memory.load_memory_variables({})`. Note that the empty dictionary that we pass in is just a placeholder for real variables. If the memory type you are using is dependent upon the input variables, you may need to pass some in. ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': ""Human: hi!\\nAI: what\'s up?""} ``` In this case, you can see that `load_memory_variables` returns a single key, `history`. This means that your chain (and likely your prompt) should expect an input named `history`. You can usually control this variable through parameters on the memory class. For example, if you want the memory variables to be returned in the key `chat_history` you can do: ```python memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` ```text {\'chat_history\': ""Human: hi!\\nAI: what\'s up?""} ``` The parameter name to control these keys may vary per memory type, but it\'s important to understand that (1) this is controllable, and (2) how to control it. ### Whether memory is a string or a list of messages One of the most common types of memory involves returning a list of chat messages. These can either be returned as a single string, all concatenated together (useful when they will be passed into LLMs) or a list of ChatMessages (useful when passed into ChatModels). By default, they are returned as a single string. In order to return as a list of messages, you can set `return_messages=True` ```python memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True) memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` ```text {\'history\': [HumanMessage(content=\'hi!\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'what\'s up?\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]} ``` ### What keys are saved to memory Often times chains take in or return multiple input/output keys. In these cases, how can we know which keys we want to save to the chat message history? This is generally controllable by `input_key` and `output_key` parameters on the memory types. These default to `None` - and if there is only one input/output key it is known to just use that. However, if there are multiple input/output keys then you MUST specify the name of which one to use. ### End to end example Finally, let\'s take a look at using this in a chain. We\'ll use an `LLMChain`, and show working with both an LLM and a ChatModel. #### Using an LLM ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) # Notice that ""chat_history"" is present in the prompt template template = """"""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human. Previous conversation: {chat_history} New human question: {question} Response:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template) # Notice that we need to align the `memory_key` memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") conversation = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory ) ``` ```python # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` #### Using a ChatModel ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, ) from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = ChatOpenAI() prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}"") ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name. memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory ) ``` ```python # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ## Next steps And that\'s it for getting started!

This notebook goes over how to store and use chat message history in a `Streamlit` app. `StreamlitChatMessageHistory` will store messages in [Streamlit session state]( at the specified `key=`. The default key is `""langchain_messages""`. - Note, `StreamlitChatMessageHistory` only works when run in a Streamlit app. - You may also be interested in [StreamlitCallbackHandler](/docs/integrations/callbacks/streamlit) for LangChain. - For more on Streamlit check out their [getting started documentation]( You can see the [full app example running here]( and more examples in [github.com/langchain-ai/streamlit-agent]( ```python from langchain.memory import StreamlitChatMessageHistory history = StreamlitChatMessageHistory(key=""chat_messages"") history.add_user_message(""hi!"") history.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` ```python history.messages ``` You can integrate `StreamlitChatMessageHistory` into `ConversationBufferMemory` and chains or agents as usual. The history will be persisted across re-runs of the Streamlit app within a given user session. A given `StreamlitChatMessageHistory` will NOT be persisted or shared across user sessions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.memory.chat_message_histories import StreamlitChatMessageHistory # Optionally, specify your own session_state key for storing messages msgs = StreamlitChatMessageHistory(key=""special_app_key"") memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""history"", chat_memory=msgs) if len(msgs.messages) == 0: msgs.add_ai_message(""How can I help you?"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate template = """"""You are an AI chatbot having a conversation with a human. {history} Human: {human_input} AI: """""" prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[""history"", ""human_input""], template=template) # Add the memory to an LLMChain as usual llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(), prompt=prompt, memory=memory) ``` Conversational Streamlit apps will often re-draw each previous chat message on every re-run. This is easy to do by iterating through `StreamlitChatMessageHistory.messages`: ```python import streamlit as st for msg in msgs.messages: st.chat_message(msg.type).write(msg.content) if prompt := st.chat_input(): st.chat_message(""human"").write(prompt) # As usual, new messages are added to StreamlitChatMessageHistory when the Chain is called. response = llm_chain.run(prompt) st.chat_message(""ai"").write(response) ``` **View the final app.**', 'Elasticsearch | Elasticsearch [Elasticsearch]( is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine, capable of performing both vector and lexical search.

The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1.

Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to ""Write a story outline."" This provides a high-level structure for the task and helps in breaking it down into smaller components.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Agents can also take inputs from humans to decompose tasks. This can be done through direct communication or by leveraging human expertise.

Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents.

We will add the [ConversationBufferMemory]( class, although this can be any memory class. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` The most important step is setting up the prompt correctly. In the below prompt, we have two input keys: one for the actual input, another for the input from the Memory class. Importantly, we make sure the keys in the `PromptTemplate` and the `ConversationBufferMemory` match up (`chat_history`). ```python template = """"""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. {chat_history} Human: {human_input} Chatbot:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""chat_history"", ""human_input""], template=template ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend Chatbot: > Finished chain. \' Hi there! How can I help you today?\' ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Not too bad - how are you?"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend AI: Hi there! How can I help you today? Human: Not too bad - how are you? Chatbot: > Finished chain. "" I\'m doing great, thanks for asking! How are you doing?"" ``` ## Adding Memory to a chat model-based LLMChain The above works for completion-style `LLM`s, but if you are using a chat model, you will likely get better performance using structured chat messages. Below is an example. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, ) from langchain.schema import SystemMessage ``` We will use the [ChatPromptTemplate]( class to set up the chat prompt. The [from_messages]( method creates a `ChatPromptTemplate` from a list of messages (e.g., `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ChatMessage`, etc.) or message templates, such as the [MessagesPlaceholder]( below. The configuration below makes it so the memory will be injected to the middle of the chat prompt, in the `chat_history` key, and the user\'s inputs will be added in a human/user message to the end of the chat prompt. ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The persistent system prompt MessagesPlaceholder( variable_name=""chat_history"" ), # Where the memory will be stored. HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""{human_input}"" ), # Where the human input will injected ] ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI() chat_llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

The overall steps are: 1. Download your messenger data to disk. 2. Create the Chat Loader and call `loader.load()` (or `loader.lazy_load()`) to perform the conversion. 3. Optionally use `merge_chat_runs` to combine message from the same sender in sequence, and/or `map_ai_messages` to convert messages from the specified sender to the ""AIMessage"" class. Once you\'ve done this, call `convert_messages_for_finetuning` to prepare your data for fine-tuning. Once this has been done, you can fine-tune your model. To do so you would complete the following steps: 1. Upload your messages to OpenAI and run a fine-tuning job. 2. Use the resulting model in your LangChain app! Let\'s begin. ## 1. Download Data To download your own messenger data, following instructions [here]( IMPORTANT - make sure to download them in JSON format (not HTML). We are hosting an example dump at [this google drive link]( that we will use in this walkthrough. ```python # This uses some example data import zipfile import requests def download_and_unzip(url: str, output_path: str = ""file.zip"") -> None: file_id = url.split(""/"")[-2] download_url = f"" response = requests.get(download_url) if response.status_code != 200: print(""Failed to download the file."") return with open(output_path, ""wb"") as file: file.write(response.content) print(f""File {output_path} downloaded."") with zipfile.ZipFile(output_path, ""r"") as zip_ref: zip_ref.extractall() print(f""File {output_path} has been unzipped."") # URL of the file to download url = ( "" ) # Download and unzip download_and_unzip(url) ``` ```text File file.zip downloaded. File file.zip has been unzipped. ``` ## 2. Create Chat Loader We have 2 different `FacebookMessengerChatLoader` classes, one for an entire directory of chats, and one to load individual files. We ```python directory_path = ""./hogwarts"" ``` ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.facebook_messenger import ( FolderFacebookMessengerChatLoader, SingleFileFacebookMessengerChatLoader, ) ``` ```python loader = SingleFileFacebookMessengerChatLoader( path=""./hogwarts/inbox/HermioneGranger/messages_Hermione_Granger.json"", ) ``` ```python chat_session = loader.load()[0] chat_session[""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=""Hi Hermione!

My summer is going well, though I do miss everyone. I\'m spending most of my time going through my books and researching fascinating new topics. How about you?"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Hermione Granger\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""I miss you all too. The Dursleys are being their usual unpleasant selves but I\'m getting by. At least I can practice some spells in my room without them knowing.

Prepare for fine-tuning Calling `load()` returns all the chat messages we could extract as human messages. When conversing with chat bots, conversations typically follow a more strict alternating dialogue pattern relative to real conversations. You can choose to merge message ""runs"" (consecutive messages from the same sender) and select a sender to represent the ""AI"". The fine-tuned LLM will learn to generate these AI messages. ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.utils import ( map_ai_messages, merge_chat_runs, ) ``` ```python merged_sessions = merge_chat_runs(chat_sessions) alternating_sessions = list(map_ai_messages(merged_sessions, ""Harry Potter"")) ``` ```python # Now all of Harry Potter\'s messages will take the AI message class # which maps to the \'assistant\' role in OpenAI\'s training format alternating_sessions[0][""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [AIMessage(content=""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""What is it, Potter? I\'m quite busy at the moment."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Severus Snape\'}, example=False), AIMessage(content=""I apologize for the interruption, sir. I\'ll be brief. I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False)] ``` #### Now we can convert to OpenAI format dictionaries ```python from langchain.adapters.openai import convert_messages_for_finetuning ``` ```python training_data = convert_messages_for_finetuning(alternating_sessions) print(f""Prepared {len(training_data)} dialogues for training"") ``` ```text Prepared 9 dialogues for training ``` ```python training_data[0][:3] ``` ```text [{\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately.""}, {\'role\': \'user\', \'content\': ""What is it, Potter? I\'m quite busy at the moment.""}, {\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""I apologize for the interruption, sir. I\'ll be brief. I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister.""}] ``` OpenAI currently requires at least 10 training examples for a fine-tuning job, though they recommend between 50-100 for most tasks. Since we only have 9 chat sessions, we can subdivide them (optionally with some overlap) so that each training example is comprised of a portion of a whole conversation. Facebook chat sessions (1 per person) often span multiple days and conversations, so the long-range dependencies may not be that important to model anyhow. ```python # Our chat is alternating, we will make each datapoint a group of 8 messages, # with 2 messages overlapping chunk_size = 8 overlap = 2 training_examples = [ conversation_messages[i : i + chunk_size] for conversation_messages in training_data for i in range(0, len(conversation_messages) - chunk_size + 1, chunk_size - overlap) ] len(training_examples) ``` ```text 100 ``` ## 4. Fine-tune the model It\'s time to fine-tune the model. Make sure you have `openai` installed and have set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` appropriately ```python # %pip install -U openai --quiet ``` ```python import json import time from io import BytesIO import openai # We will write the jsonl file in memory my_file = BytesIO() for m in training_examples: my_file.write((json.dumps({""messages"": m}) + ""\\n"").encode(""utf-8"")) my_file.seek(0) training_file = openai.File.create(file=my_file, purpose=""fine-tune"") # OpenAI audits each training file for compliance reasons. # This make take a few minutes status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""processed"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status print(f""File {training_file.id} ready after {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds."") ``` ```text File file-zCyNBeg4snpbBL7VkvsuhCz8 ready afer 30.55 seconds. ``` With the file ready, it\'s time to kick off a training job. ```python job = openai.FineTuningJob.create( training_file=training_file.id, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) ``` Grab a cup of tea while your model is being prepared. This may take some time! ```python status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""succeeded"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) job = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id) status = job.status ``` ```text Status=[running]... 908.87s ``` ```python print(job.fine_tuned_model) ``` ```text ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::7rDwkaOq ``` ## 5. Use in LangChain You can use the resulting model ID directly the `ChatOpenAI` model class. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI model = ChatOpenAI( model=job.fine_tuned_model, temperature=1, ) ``` ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) chain = prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python for tok in chain.stream({""input"": ""What classes are you taking?""}): print(tok, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text The usual - Potions, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts.

Use in LangChain](#5-use-in-langchain)', 'Elasticsearch | Elasticsearch [Elasticsearch]( is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine, capable of performing both vector and lexical search. It is built on top of the Apache Lucene library. This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `Elasticsearch` database. ```bash pip install elasticsearch openai tiktoken langchain ``` ## Running and connecting to Elasticsearch There are two main ways to setup an Elasticsearch instance for use with: 1. Elastic Cloud: Elastic Cloud is a managed Elasticsearch service. Signup for a [free trial]( To connect to an Elasticsearch instance that does not require login credentials (starting the docker instance with security enabled), pass the Elasticsearch URL and index name along with the embedding object to the constructor. 1. Local Install Elasticsearch: Get started with Elasticsearch by running it locally. The easiest way is to use the official Elasticsearch Docker image. See the [Elasticsearch Docker documentation]( for more information. ### Running Elasticsearch via Docker Example: Run a single-node Elasticsearch instance with security disabled. This is not recommended for production use. ```bash docker run -p 9200:9200 -e ""discovery.type=single-node"" -e ""xpack.security.enabled=false"" -e ""xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled=false"" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.9.0 ``` Once the Elasticsearch instance is running, you can connect to it using the Elasticsearch URL and index name along with the embedding object to the constructor. Example: ```python from langchain.vectorstores.elasticsearch import ElasticsearchStore from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings() elastic_vector_search = ElasticsearchStore( es_url="" index_name=""test_index"", embedding=embedding ) ``` ### Authentication For production, we recommend you run with security enabled. To connect with login credentials, you can use the parameters `api_key` or `es_user` and `es_password`. Example: ```python from langchain.vectorstores import ElasticsearchStore from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings() elastic_vector_search = ElasticsearchStore( es_url="" index_name=""test_index"", embedding=embedding, es_user=""elastic"", es_password=""changeme"" ) ``` #### How to obtain a password for the default ""elastic"" user? To obtain your Elastic Cloud password for the default ""elastic"" user: 1. Log in to the Elastic Cloud console at [ 2. Go to ""Security"" > ""Users"" 3. Locate the ""elastic"" user and click ""Edit"" 4. Click ""Reset password"" 5. Follow the prompts to reset the password #### How to obtain an API key? To obtain an API key: 1. Log in to the Elastic Cloud console at [ 2. Open Kibana and go to Stack Management > API Keys 3. Click ""Create API key"" 4. Enter a name for the API key and click ""Create"" 5. Copy the API key and paste it into the `api_key` parameter ### Elastic Cloud To connect to an Elasticsearch instance on Elastic Cloud, you can use either the `es_cloud_id` parameter or `es_url`. Example: ```python from langchain.vectorstores.elasticsearch import ElasticsearchStore from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings() elastic_vector_search = ElasticsearchStore( es_cloud_id="""", index_name=""test_index"", embedding=embedding, es_user=""elastic"", es_password=""changeme"" ) ``` We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` ## Basic Example This example we are going to load ""state_of_the_union.txt"" via the TextLoader, chunk the text into 500 word chunks, and then index each chunk into Elasticsearch. Once the data is indexed, we perform a simple query to find the top 4 chunks that similar to the query ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"". Elasticsearch is running locally on localhost:9200 with [docker](#running-elasticsearch-via-docker). For more details on how to connect to Elasticsearch from Elastic Cloud, see [connecting with authentication](#authentication) above. ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import ElasticsearchStore ``` ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter loader = TextLoader(""../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ```python db = ElasticsearchStore.from_documents( docs, embeddings, es_url="" index_name=""test-basic"", ) db.client.indices.refresh(index=""test-basic"") query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query) print(results) ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \\n\\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.

This metadata dict object is stored in a metadata object field in the Elasticsearch document. Based on the metadata value, Elasticsearch will automatically setup the mapping by infering the data type of the metadata value. For example, if the metadata value is a string, Elasticsearch will setup the mapping for the metadata object field as a string type. ```python # Adding metadata to documents for i, doc in enumerate(docs): doc.metadata[""date""] = f""{range(2010, 2020)[i % 10]}-01-01"" doc.metadata[""rating""] = range(1, 6)[i % 5] doc.metadata[""author""] = [""John Doe"", ""Jane Doe""][i % 2] db = ElasticsearchStore.from_documents( docs, embeddings, es_url="" index_name=""test-metadata"" ) query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" docs = db.similarity_search(query) print(docs[0].metadata) ``` ```text {\'source\': \'../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt\', \'date\': \'2016-01-01\', \'rating\': 2, \'author\': \'John Doe\'} ``` ## Filtering Metadata With metadata added to the documents, you can add metadata filtering at query time. ### Example: Filter by Exact keyword Notice: We are using the keyword subfield thats not analyzed ```python docs = db.similarity_search( query, filter=[{""term"": {""metadata.author.keyword"": ""John Doe""}}] ) print(docs[0].metadata) ``` ```text {\'source\': \'../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt\', \'date\': \'2016-01-01\', \'rating\': 2, \'author\': \'John Doe\'} ``` ### Example: Filter by Partial Match This example shows how to filter by partial match. This is useful when you don\'t know the exact value of the metadata field. For example, if you want to filter by the metadata field `author` and you don\'t know the exact value of the author, you can use a partial match to filter by the author\'s last name. Fuzzy matching is also supported. ""Jon"" matches on ""John Doe"" as ""Jon"" is a close match to ""John"" token. ```python docs = db.similarity_search( query, filter=[{""match"": {""metadata.author"": {""query"": ""Jon"", ""fuzziness"": ""AUTO""}}}], ) print(docs[0].metadata) ``` ```text {\'source\': \'../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt\', \'date\': \'2016-01-01\', \'rating\': 2, \'author\': \'John Doe\'} ``` ### Example: Filter by Date Range ```python docs = db.similarity_search( ""Any mention about Fred?"", filter=[{""range"": {""metadata.date"": {""gte"": ""2010-01-01""}}}], ) print(docs[0].metadata) ``` ```text {\'source\': \'../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt\', \'date\': \'2012-01-01\', \'rating\': 3, \'author\': \'John Doe\', \'geo_location\': {\'lat\': 40.12, \'lon\': -71.34}} ``` ### Example: Filter by Numeric Range ```python docs = db.similarity_search( ""Any mention about Fred?"", filter=[{""range"": {""metadata.rating"": {""gte"": 2}}}] ) print(docs[0].metadata) ``` ```text {\'source\': \'../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt\', \'date\': \'2012-01-01\', \'rating\': 3, \'author\': \'John Doe\', \'geo_location\': {\'lat\': 40.12, \'lon\': -71.34}} ``` ### Example: Filter by Geo Distance Requires an index with a geo_point mapping to be declared for `metadata.geo_location`. ```python docs = db.similarity_search( ""Any mention about Fred?"", filter=[ { ""geo_distance"": { ""distance"": ""200km"", ""metadata.geo_location"": {""lat"": 40, ""lon"": -70}, } } ], ) print(docs[0].metadata) ``` Filter supports many more types of queries than above. Read more about them in the [documentation]( # Distance Similarity Algorithm Elasticsearch supports the following vector distance similarity algorithms: - cosine - euclidean - dot_product The cosine similarity algorithm is the default. You can specify the similarity Algorithm needed via the similarity parameter. **NOTE** Depending on the retrieval strategy, the similarity algorithm cannot be changed at query time. It is needed to be set when creating the index mapping for field. If you need to change the similarity algorithm, you need to delete the index and recreate it with the correct distance_strategy. ```python db = ElasticsearchStore.from_documents( docs, embeddings, es_url="" index_name=""test"", distance_strategy=""COSINE"" # distance_strategy=""EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE"" # distance_strategy=""DOT_PRODUCT"" ) ``` # Retrieval Strategies Elasticsearch has big advantages over other vector only databases from its ability to support a wide range of retrieval strategies. In this notebook we will configure `ElasticsearchStore` to support some of the most common retrieval strategies. By default, `ElasticsearchStore` uses the `ApproxRetrievalStrategy`. ## ApproxRetrievalStrategy This will return the top `k` most similar vectors to the query vector. The `k` parameter is set when the `ElasticsearchStore` is initialized. The default value is `10`. ```python db = ElasticsearchStore.from_documents( docs, embeddings, es_url="" index_name=""test"", strategy=ElasticsearchStore.ApproxRetrievalStrategy(), ) docs = db.similarity_search( query=""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson?"", k=10 ) ``` ### Example: Approx with hybrid This example will show how to configure `ElasticsearchStore` to perform a hybrid retrieval, using a combination of approximate semantic search and keyword based search. We use RRF to balance the two scores from different retrieval methods. To enable hybrid retrieval, we need to set `hybrid=True` in `ElasticsearchStore` `ApproxRetrievalStrategy` constructor. ```python db = ElasticsearchStore.from_documents( docs, embeddings, es_url="" index_name=""test"", strategy=ElasticsearchStore.ApproxRetrievalStrategy( hybrid=True, ) ) ``` When `hybrid` is enabled, the query performed will be a combination of approximate semantic search and keyword based search. It will use `rrf` (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) to balance the two scores from different retrieval methods. **Note** RRF requires Elasticsearch 8.9.0 or above. ```json { ""knn"": { ""field"": ""vector"", ""filter"": [], ""k"": 1, ""num_candidates"": 50, ""query_vector"": [1.0, ..., 0.0], }, ""query"": { ""bool"": { ""filter"": [], ""must"": [{""match"": {""text"": {""query"": ""foo""}}}], } }, ""rank"": {""rrf"": {}}, } ``` ### Example: Approx with Embedding Model in Elasticsearch This example will show how to configure `ElasticsearchStore` to use the embedding model deployed in Elasticsearch for approximate retrieval. To use this, specify the model_id in `ElasticsearchStore` `ApproxRetrievalStrategy` constructor via the `query_model_id` argument. **NOTE** This requires the model to be deployed and running in Elasticsearch ml node. See [notebook example]( on how to deploy the model with eland. ```python APPROX_SELF_DEPLOYED_INDEX_NAME = ""test-approx-self-deployed"" # Note: This does not have an embedding function specified # Instead, we will use the embedding model deployed in Elasticsearch db = ElasticsearchStore( es_cloud_id="""", es_user=""elastic"", es_password="""", index_name=APPROX_SELF_DEPLOYED_INDEX_NAME, query_field=""text_field"", vector_query_field=""vector_query_field.predicted_value"", strategy=ElasticsearchStore.ApproxRetrievalStrategy( query_model_id=""sentence-transformers__all-minilm-l6-v2"" ), ) # Setup a Ingest Pipeline to perform the embedding # of the text field db.client.ingest.put_pipeline( id=""test_pipeline"", processors=[ { ""inference"": { ""model_id"": ""sentence-transformers__all-minilm-l6-v2"", ""field_map"": {""query_field"": ""text_field""}, ""target_field"": ""vector_query_field"", } } ], ) # creating a new index with the pipeline, # not relying on langchain to create the index db.client.indices.create( index=APPROX_SELF_DEPLOYED_INDEX_NAME, mappings={ ""properties"": { ""text_field"": {""type"": ""text""}, ""vector_query_field"": { ""properties"": { ""predicted_value"": { ""type"": ""dense_vector"", ""dims"": 384, ""index"": True, ""similarity"": ""l2_norm"", } } }, } }, settings={""index"": {""default_pipeline"": ""test_pipeline""}}, ) db.from_texts( [""hello world""], es_cloud_id="""", es_user=""elastic"", es_password="""", index_name=APPROX_SELF_DEPLOYED_INDEX_NAME, query_field=""text_field"", vector_query_field=""vector_query_field.predicted_value"", strategy=ElasticsearchStore.ApproxRetrievalStrategy( query_model_id=""sentence-transformers__all-minilm-l6-v2"" ), ) # Perform search db.similarity_search(""hello world"", k=10) ``` ## SparseVectorRetrievalStrategy (ELSER) This strategy uses Elasticsearch\'s sparse vector retrieval to retrieve the top-k results. We only support our own ""ELSER"" embedding model for now. **NOTE** This requires the ELSER model to be deployed and running in Elasticsearch ml node. To use this, specify `SparseVectorRetrievalStrategy` in `ElasticsearchStore` constructor. ```python # Note that this example doesn\'t have an embedding function. This is because we infer the tokens at index time and at query time within Elasticsearch. # This requires the ELSER model to be loaded and running in Elasticsearch. db = ElasticsearchStore.from_documents( docs, es_cloud_id=""My_deployment:dXMtY2VudHJhbDEuZ2NwLmNsb3VkLmVzLmlvOjQ0MyQ2OGJhMjhmNDc1M2Y0MWVjYTk2NzI2ZWNkMmE5YzRkNyQ3NWI4ODRjNWQ2OTU0MTYzODFjOTkxNmQ1YzYxMGI1Mw=="", es_user=""elastic"", es_password=""GgUPiWKwEzgHIYdHdgPk1Lwi"", index_name=""test-elser"", strategy=ElasticsearchStore.SparseVectorRetrievalStrategy(), ) db.client.indices.refresh(index=""test-elser"") results = db.similarity_search( ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"", k=4 ) print(results[0]) ``` ```text page_content=\'One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \\n\\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\'s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\'s legacy of excellence.\' metadata={\'source\': \'../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt\'} ``` ## ExactRetrievalStrategy This strategy uses Elasticsearch\'s exact retrieval (also known as brute force) to retrieve the top-k results. To use this, specify `ExactRetrievalStrategy` in `ElasticsearchStore` constructor. ```python db = ElasticsearchStore.from_documents( docs, embeddings, es_url="" index_name=""test"", strategy=ElasticsearchStore.ExactRetrievalStrategy() ) ``` ## Customise the Query With `custom_query` parameter at search, you are able to adjust the query that is used to retrieve documents from Elasticsearch. This is useful if you want to want to use a more complex query, to support linear boosting of fields. ```python # Example of a custom query thats just doing a BM25 search on the text field. def custom_query(query_body: dict, query: str): """"""Custom query to be used in Elasticsearch. Args: query_body (dict): Elasticsearch query body. query (str): Query string. Returns: dict: Elasticsearch query body. """""" print(""Query Retriever created by the retrieval strategy:"") print(query_body) print() new_query_body = {""query"": {""match"": {""text"": query}}} print(""Query thats actually used in Elasticsearch:"") print(new_query_body) print() return new_query_body results = db.similarity_search( ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"", k=4, custom_query=custom_query, ) print(""Results:"") print(results[0]) ``` ```text Query Retriever created by the retrieval strategy: {\'query\': {\'bool\': {\'must\': [{\'text_expansion\': {\'vector.tokens\': {\'model_id\': \'.elser_model_1\', \'model_text\': \'What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\'}}}], \'filter\': []}}} Query thats actually used in Elasticsearch: {\'query\': {\'match\': {\'text\': \'What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson\'}}} Results: page_content=\'One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \\n\\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\'s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\'s legacy of excellence.\' metadata={\'source\': \'../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt\'} ``` # Customize the Document Builder With `doc_builder` parameter at search, you are able to adjust how a Document is being built using data retrieved from Elasticsearch. This is especially useful if you have indices which were not created using Langchain. ```python from typing import Dict from langchain.docstore.document import Document def custom_document_builder(hit: Dict) -> Document: src = hit.get(""_source"", {}) return Document( page_content=src.get(""content"", ""Missing content!""), metadata={ ""page_number"": src.get(""page_number"", -1), ""original_filename"": src.get(""original_filename"", ""Missing filename!""), }, ) results = db.similarity_search( ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"", k=4, doc_builder=custom_document_builder, ) print(""Results:"") print(results[0]) ``` # FAQ ## Question: Im getting timeout errors when indexing documents into Elasticsearch. How do I fix this? One possible issue is your documents might take longer to index into Elasticsearch. ElasticsearchStore uses the Elasticsearch bulk API which has a few defaults that you can adjust to reduce the chance of timeout errors. This is also a good idea when you\'re using SparseVectorRetrievalStrategy. The defaults are: - `chunk_size`: 500 - `max_chunk_bytes`: 100MB To adjust these, you can pass in the `chunk_size` and `max_chunk_bytes` parameters to the ElasticsearchStore `add_texts` method. ```python vector_store.add_texts( texts, bulk_kwargs={ ""chunk_size"": 50, ""max_chunk_bytes"": 200000000 } ) ``` # Upgrading to ElasticsearchStore If you\'re already using Elasticsearch in your langchain based project, you may be using the old implementations: `ElasticVectorSearch` and `ElasticKNNSearch` which are now deprecated. We\'ve introduced a new implementation called `ElasticsearchStore` which is more flexible and easier to use. This notebook will guide you through the process of upgrading to the new implementation. ## What\'s new? The new implementation is now one class called `ElasticsearchStore` which can be used for approx, exact, and ELSER search retrieval, via strategies. ## Im using ElasticKNNSearch Old implementation: ```python from langchain.vectorstores.elastic_vector_search import ElasticKNNSearch db = ElasticKNNSearch( elasticsearch_url="" index_name=""test_index"", embedding=embedding ) ``` New implementation: ```python from langchain.vectorstores.elasticsearch import ElasticsearchStore db = ElasticsearchStore( es_url="" index_name=""test_index"", embedding=embedding, # if you use the model_id # strategy=ElasticsearchStore.ApproxRetrievalStrategy( query_model_id=""test_model"" ) # if you use hybrid search # strategy=ElasticsearchStore.ApproxRetrievalStrategy( hybrid=True ) ) ``` ## Im using ElasticVectorSearch Old implementation: ```python from langchain.vectorstores.elastic_vector_search import ElasticVectorSearch db = ElasticVectorSearch( elasticsearch_url="" index_name=""test_index"", embedding=embedding ) ``` New implementation: ```python from langchain.vectorstores.elasticsearch import ElasticsearchStore db = ElasticsearchStore( es_url="" index_name=""test_index"", embedding=embedding, strategy=ElasticsearchStore.ExactRetrievalStrategy() ) ``` ```python db.client.indices.delete( index=""test-metadata, test-elser, test-basic"", ignore_unavailable=True, allow_no_indices=True, ) ``` ```text ObjectApiResponse({\'acknowledged\': True}) ``` - [Running and connecting to Elasticsearch](#running-and-connecting-to-elasticsearch)- [Running Elasticsearch via Docker](#running-elasticsearch-via-docker) - [Authentication](#authentication) - [Elastic Cloud](#elastic-cloud) - [Basic Example](#basic-example) - [Filtering Metadata](#filtering-metadata)- [Example: Filter by Exact keyword](#example-filter-by-exact-keyword) - [Example: Filter by Partial Match](#example-filter-by-partial-match) - [Example: Filter by Date Range](#example-filter-by-date-range) - [Example: Filter by Numeric Range](#example-filter-by-numeric-range) - [Example: Filter by Geo Distance](#example-filter-by-geo-distance) - [ApproxRetrievalStrategy](#approxretrievalstrategy)- [Example: Approx with hybrid](#example-approx-with-hybrid) - [Example: Approx with Embedding Model in Elasticsearch](#example-approx-with-embedding-model-in-elasticsearch) - [SparseVectorRetrievalStrategy (ELSER)](#sparsevectorretrievalstrategy-elser) - [ExactRetrievalStrategy](#exactretrievalstrategy) - [Customise the Query](#customise-the-query) - [Question: Im getting timeout errors when indexing documents into Elasticsearch.

Let L 1 , . . . , L s be line bundles on P d Σ and let π ∶ P ( E ) → P d Σ be the projective space bundle associated to the vector bundle E = L 1 ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ L s . It is known that P ( E ) is a ( d + s − 1 ) -dimensional simplicial toric variety whose fan depends on the degrees of the line bundles and the fan Σ. Furthermore, if the Cox ring, without considering the grading, of P d Σ is C [ x 1 , . . . , x m ] then the Cox ring of P ( E ) is\\n\\nMoreover for X a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety cut o by f 1 , . . . , f s with deg ( f i ) = [ L i ] we relate the hypersurface Y cut o by F = y 1 f 1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + y s f s which turns out to be quasi-smooth. For more details see Section 2 in [7].\\n\\nWe will denote P ( E ) as P d + s − 1 Σ ,X to keep track of its relation with X and P d Σ .\\n\\nThe following is a key remark.\\n\\nRemark 4.1 . There is a morphism ι ∶ X → Y ⊂ P d + s − 1 Σ ,X . Moreover every point z ∶ = ( x, y ) ∈ Y with y ≠ 0 has a preimage. Hence for any subvariety W = V ( I W ) ⊂ X ⊂ P d Σ there exists W ′ ⊂ Y ⊂ P d + s − 1 Σ ,X such that π ( W ′ ) = W , i.e., W ′ = { z = ( x, y ) ∣ x ∈ W } .\\n\\nFor X ⊂ P d Σ a quasi-smooth intersection variety the morphism in cohomology induced by the inclusion i ∗ ∶ H d − s ( P d Σ , C ) → H d − s ( X, C ) is injective by Proposition 1.4 in [7].\\n\\nDenition 4.2. The primitive cohomology of H d − s prim ( X ) is the quotient H d − s ( X, C )/ i ∗ ( H d − s ( P d Σ , C )) and H d − s prim ( X, Q ) with rational coecients.\\n\\nH d − s ( P d Σ , C ) and H d − s ( X, C ) have pure Hodge structures, and the morphism i ∗ is com- patible with them, so that H d − s prim ( X ) gets a pure Hodge structure.\\n\\nThe next Proposition is the Cayley proposition.\\n\\nProposition 4.3. [Proposition 2.3 in [3] ] Let X = X 1 ∩⋅ ⋅ ⋅∩ X s be a quasi-smooth intersec- tion subvariety in P d Σ cut o by homogeneous polynomials f 1 . . . f s . Then for p ≠ d + s − 1 2 , d + s − 3 2\\n\\nRemark 4.5 . The above isomorphisms are also true with rational coecients since H ( X, C ) = H ( X, Q ) ⊗ Q C . See the beginning of Section 7.1 in [10] for more details.\\n\\nTheorem 5.1. Let Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯ + y k f k = 0 } ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface associated to the quasi-smooth intersection surface X = X f 1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ X f k ⊂ P k + 2 Σ . Then on Y the Hodge conjecture holds.\\n\\nthe Hodge conjecture holds.\\n\\nProof. If H k,k prim ( X, Q ) = 0 we are done. So let us assume H k,k prim ( X, Q ) ≠ 0. By the Cayley proposition H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) ≃ H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) and by the ( 1 , 1 ) -Lefschetz theorem for projective\\n\\ntoric orbifolds there is a non-zero algebraic basis λ C 1 , . . . , λ C n with rational coecients of H 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) , that is, there are n ∶ = h 1 , 1 prim ( X, Q ) algebraic curves C 1 , . . . , C n in X such that under the Poincar´e duality the class in homology [ C i ] goes to λ C i , [ C i ] ↦ λ C i . Recall that the Cox ring of P k + 2 is contained in the Cox ring of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X without considering the grading. Considering the grading we have that if α ∈ Cl ( P k + 2 Σ ) then ( α, 0 ) ∈ Cl ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ) . So the polynomials dening C i ⊂ P k + 2 Σ can be interpreted in P 2 k + 1 X, Σ but with dierent degree. Moreover, by Remark 4.1 each C i is contained in Y = { F = y 1 f 1 + ⋯ + y k f k = 0 } and\\n\\nfurthermore it has codimension k .\\n\\nClaim: { C i } ni = 1 is a basis of prim ( ) . It is enough to prove that λ C i is dierent from zero in H k,k prim ( Y, Q ) or equivalently that the cohomology classes { λ C i } ni = 1 do not come from the ambient space. By contradiction, let us assume that there exists a j and C ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that λ C ∈ H k,k ( P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X , Q ) with i ∗ ( λ C ) = λ C j or in terms of homology there exists a ( k + 2 ) -dimensional algebraic subvariety V ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X such that V ∩ Y = C j so they are equal as a homology class of P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X ,i.e., [ V ∩ Y ] = [ C j ] . It is easy to check that π ( V ) ∩ X = C j as a subvariety of P k + 2 Σ where π ∶ ( x, y ) ↦ x . Hence [ π ( V ) ∩ X ] = [ C j ] which is equivalent to say that λ C j comes from P k + 2 Σ which contradicts the choice of [ C j ] .\\n\\nRemark 5.2 . Into the proof of the previous theorem, the key fact was that on X the Hodge conjecture holds and we translate it to Y by contradiction. So, using an analogous argument we have:\\n\\nargument we have:\\n\\nProposition 5.3. Let Y = { F = y 1 f s +⋯+ y s f s = 0 } ⊂ P 2 k + 1 Σ ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface associated to a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety X = X f 1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ X f s ⊂ P d Σ such that d + s = 2 ( k + 1 ) . If the Hodge conjecture holds on X then it holds as well on Y .\\n\\nCorollary 5.4. If the dimension of Y is 2 s − 1 , 2 s or 2 s + 1 then the Hodge conjecture holds on Y .\\n\\nProof.

1. **Set Up Environment**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You might need `langchain`, `torch`, and other dependencies.

2. **Model Download**: Download the LLaMA 2 model. This can typically be done from the official repository or a trusted source.

3. **Initialize the Model**: Use Langchain to initialize the LLaMA 2 model. This usually involves specifying the model path and any required configurations.

4. **Run Inference**: Use the initialized model to run inference on your input data.

Here's a simplified example:

```python
from langchain import LangchainModel
import torch

# Initialize the model
model_path = ""path/to/your/llama2_model""
model = LangchainModel(model_path)

# Run inference
input_text = ""Your input text here""
output = model.generate(input_text)

print(output)
```

For detailed instructions, refer to the official Langchain documentation and the LLaMA 2 repository. Always ensure you comply with the usage policies of the model and the libraries you are using.","Llama 2 can be run through a number of LangChain llm and chat model integrations. A non-exhaustive list includes LlamaCPP, Ollama, Huggingface, Fireworks, and Replicate, HuggingFace. These imports would be
```python
from langchain.llms import Fireworks, HuggingFacePipeline, LlamaCpp, Ollama, Replicate, HuggingFaceHub, HuggingFaceTextGenInference, HuggingFaceEndpoint
from langchain.chat_models import ChatFireworks, ChatOllama

Initializing any of these classes with a parameter pointing to the llama2 model should suffice. Noteably, there is no LangChain class called Llama2, Llama, or Huggingface (with no suffixes).

The overall steps are: 1. Download your messenger data to disk. 2. Create the Chat Loader and call `loader.load()` (or `loader.lazy_load()`) to perform the conversion. 3. Optionally use `merge_chat_runs` to combine message from the same sender in sequence, and/or `map_ai_messages` to convert messages from the specified sender to the ""AIMessage"" class. Once you\'ve done this, call `convert_messages_for_finetuning` to prepare your data for fine-tuning. Once this has been done, you can fine-tune your model. To do so you would complete the following steps: 1. Upload your messages to OpenAI and run a fine-tuning job. 2. Use the resulting model in your LangChain app! Let\'s begin. ## 1. Download Data To download your own messenger data, following instructions [here]( IMPORTANT - make sure to download them in JSON format (not HTML). We are hosting an example dump at [this google drive link]( that we will use in this walkthrough. ```python # This uses some example data import zipfile import requests def download_and_unzip(url: str, output_path: str = ""file.zip"") -> None: file_id = url.split(""/"")[-2] download_url = f"" response = requests.get(download_url) if response.status_code != 200: print(""Failed to download the file."") return with open(output_path, ""wb"") as file: file.write(response.content) print(f""File {output_path} downloaded."") with zipfile.ZipFile(output_path, ""r"") as zip_ref: zip_ref.extractall() print(f""File {output_path} has been unzipped."") # URL of the file to download url = ( "" ) # Download and unzip download_and_unzip(url) ``` ```text File file.zip downloaded. File file.zip has been unzipped. ``` ## 2. Create Chat Loader We have 2 different `FacebookMessengerChatLoader` classes, one for an entire directory of chats, and one to load individual files. We ```python directory_path = ""./hogwarts"" ``` ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.facebook_messenger import ( FolderFacebookMessengerChatLoader, SingleFileFacebookMessengerChatLoader, ) ``` ```python loader = SingleFileFacebookMessengerChatLoader( path=""./hogwarts/inbox/HermioneGranger/messages_Hermione_Granger.json"", ) ``` ```python chat_session = loader.load()[0] chat_session[""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=""Hi Hermione! How\'s your summer going so far?"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""Harry! Lovely to hear from you. My summer is going well, though I do miss everyone. I\'m spending most of my time going through my books and researching fascinating new topics. How about you?"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Hermione Granger\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""I miss you all too. The Dursleys are being their usual unpleasant selves but I\'m getting by. At least I can practice some spells in my room without them knowing. Let me know if you find anything good in your researching!"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False)] ``` ```python loader = FolderFacebookMessengerChatLoader( path=""./hogwarts"", ) ``` ```python chat_sessions = loader.load() len(chat_sessions) ``` ```text 9 ``` ## 3. Prepare for fine-tuning Calling `load()` returns all the chat messages we could extract as human messages. When conversing with chat bots, conversations typically follow a more strict alternating dialogue pattern relative to real conversations. You can choose to merge message ""runs"" (consecutive messages from the same sender) and select a sender to represent the ""AI"". The fine-tuned LLM will learn to generate these AI messages. ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.utils import ( map_ai_messages, merge_chat_runs, ) ``` ```python merged_sessions = merge_chat_runs(chat_sessions) alternating_sessions = list(map_ai_messages(merged_sessions, ""Harry Potter"")) ``` ```python # Now all of Harry Potter\'s messages will take the AI message class # which maps to the \'assistant\' role in OpenAI\'s training format alternating_sessions[0][""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [AIMessage(content=""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""What is it, Potter? I\'m quite busy at the moment."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Severus Snape\'}, example=False), AIMessage(content=""I apologize for the interruption, sir. I\'ll be brief. I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False)] ``` #### Now we can convert to OpenAI format dictionaries ```python from langchain.adapters.openai import convert_messages_for_finetuning ``` ```python training_data = convert_messages_for_finetuning(alternating_sessions) print(f""Prepared {len(training_data)} dialogues for training"") ``` ```text Prepared 9 dialogues for training ``` ```python training_data[0][:3] ``` ```text [{\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately.""}, {\'role\': \'user\', \'content\': ""What is it, Potter? I\'m quite busy at the moment.""}, {\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""I apologize for the interruption, sir. I\'ll be brief. I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister.""}] ``` OpenAI currently requires at least 10 training examples for a fine-tuning job, though they recommend between 50-100 for most tasks. Since we only have 9 chat sessions, we can subdivide them (optionally with some overlap) so that each training example is comprised of a portion of a whole conversation. Facebook chat sessions (1 per person) often span multiple days and conversations, so the long-range dependencies may not be that important to model anyhow. ```python # Our chat is alternating, we will make each datapoint a group of 8 messages, # with 2 messages overlapping chunk_size = 8 overlap = 2 training_examples = [ conversation_messages[i : i + chunk_size] for conversation_messages in training_data for i in range(0, len(conversation_messages) - chunk_size + 1, chunk_size - overlap) ] len(training_examples) ``` ```text 100 ``` ## 4. Fine-tune the model It\'s time to fine-tune the model. Make sure you have `openai` installed and have set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` appropriately ```python # %pip install -U openai --quiet ``` ```python import json import time from io import BytesIO import openai # We will write the jsonl file in memory my_file = BytesIO() for m in training_examples: my_file.write((json.dumps({""messages"": m}) + ""\\n"").encode(""utf-8"")) my_file.seek(0) training_file = openai.File.create(file=my_file, purpose=""fine-tune"") # OpenAI audits each training file for compliance reasons. # This make take a few minutes status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""processed"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status print(f""File {training_file.id} ready after {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds."") ``` ```text File file-zCyNBeg4snpbBL7VkvsuhCz8 ready afer 30.55 seconds. ``` With the file ready, it\'s time to kick off a training job. ```python job = openai.FineTuningJob.create( training_file=training_file.id, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) ``` Grab a cup of tea while your model is being prepared. This may take some time! ```python status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""succeeded"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) job = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id) status = job.status ``` ```text Status=[running]... 908.87s ``` ```python print(job.fine_tuned_model) ``` ```text ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::7rDwkaOq ``` ## 5. Use in LangChain You can use the resulting model ID directly the `ChatOpenAI` model class. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI model = ChatOpenAI( model=job.fine_tuned_model, temperature=1, ) ``` ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) chain = prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python for tok in chain.stream({""input"": ""What classes are you taking?""}): print(tok, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text The usual - Potions, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts.

The main difference between the two is that the encoder is used to encode the input sequence into a fixed-length representation, while the decoder is used to decode the fixed-length representation into an output sequence. In machine translation, for example, the encoder reads in the source language sentence and generates a fixed-length representation, which is then used by the decoder to generate the target language sentence.\' ``` ```python query = ""For any token, what are x, k, v, and q?"" qa_chain.run(query) ``` ```text \'For any token, x is the input vector that contains the private information of that token, k and q are the key and query vectors respectively, which are produced by forwarding linear modules on x, and v is the vector that is calculated by propagating the same linear module on x again.

If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved. I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now. It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue it\'s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables. My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\'ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use! I didn\'t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+.

Once installed, you can use the `VLLM` class from the `langchain.llms` module to run a model. Here's an example using the `mosaicml/mpt-7b` model:

```python
from langchain.llms import VLLM

llm = VLLM(model=""mosaicml/mpt-7b"", trust_remote_code=True)
print(llm(""What is the capital of France ?""))

Make sure to replace `""mosaicml/mpt-7b""` with the model of your choice. The `trust_remote_code=True` parameter is required for models hosted on Hugging Face that include remote code execution.

This should get you started with running a model using vLLM.","You can run HuggingFace models in vLLM, so you can select the model name of a compatible Llama model then use the VLLM class in LangChain:

The tool would then have to handle the parsing logic to extract the relevant values from the text, which tightly couples the tool representation to the agent prompt. This is still useful if the underlying language model can\'t reliably generate structured schema. Let\'s take the multiplication function as an example. In order to use this, we will tell the agent to generate the ""Action Input"" as a comma-separated list of length two. We will then write a thin wrapper that takes a string, splits it into two around a comma, and passes both parsed sides as integers to the multiplication function. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` Here is the multiplication function, as well as a wrapper to parse a string as input. ```python def multiplier(a, b): return a * b def parsing_multiplier(string): a, b = string.split("","") return multiplier(int(a), int(b)) ``` ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) tools = [ Tool( name=""Multiplier"", func=parsing_multiplier, description=""useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together.

Besides the actual function that is called, the Tool consists of several components: - `name` (str), is required and must be unique within a set of tools provided to an agent - `description` (str), is optional but recommended, as it is used by an agent to determine tool use - `return_direct` (bool), defaults to False - `args_schema` (Pydantic BaseModel), is optional but recommended, can be used to provide more information (e.g., few-shot examples) or validation for expected parameters. There are two main ways to define a tool, we will cover both in the example below. ```python # Import things that are needed generically from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.chains import LLMMathChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import BaseTool, StructuredTool, Tool, tool from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper ``` Initialize the LLM to use for the agent. ```python llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ## Completely New Tools - String Input and Output The simplest tools accept a single query string and return a string output. If your tool function requires multiple arguments, you might want to skip down to the `StructuredTool` section below. There are two ways to do this: either by using the Tool dataclass, or by subclassing the BaseTool class. ### Tool dataclass The \'Tool\' dataclass wraps functions that accept a single string input and returns a string output. ```python # Load the tool configs that are needed. search = SerpAPIWrapper() llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True) tools = [ Tool.from_function( func=search.run, name=""Search"", description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", # coroutine= ... <- you can specify an async method if desired as well ), ] ``` ```text /Users/wfh/code/lc/lckg/langchain/chains/llm_math/base.py:50: UserWarning: Directly instantiating an LLMMathChain with an llm is deprecated.

This decorator can be used to quickly create a `Tool` from a simple function. The decorator uses the function name as the tool name by default, but this can be overridden by passing a string as the first argument. Additionally, the decorator will use the function\'s docstring as the tool\'s description. ```python from langchain.tools import tool @tool def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return f""Results for query {query}"" search_api ``` You can also provide arguments like the tool name and whether to return directly. ```python @tool(""search"", return_direct=True) def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return ""Results"" ``` ```python search_api ``` ```text Tool(name=\'search\', description=\'search(query: str) -> str - Searches the API for the query.\', args_schema=, return_direct=True, verbose=False, callback_manager=, func=, coroutine=None) ``` You can also provide `args_schema` to provide more information about the argument. ```python class SearchInput(BaseModel): query: str = Field(description=""should be a search query"") @tool(""search"", return_direct=True, args_schema=SearchInput) def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return ""Results"" ``` ```python search_api ``` ```text Tool(name=\'search\', description=\'search(query: str) -> str - Searches the API for the query.\', args_schema=, return_direct=True, verbose=False, callback_manager=, func=, coroutine=None) ``` ## Custom Structured Tools If your functions require more structured arguments, you can use the `StructuredTool` class directly, or still subclass the `BaseTool` class. ### StructuredTool dataclass To dynamically generate a structured tool from a given function, the fastest way to get started is with `StructuredTool.from_function()`. ```python import requests from langchain.tools import StructuredTool def post_message(url: str, body: dict, parameters: Optional[dict] = None) -> str: """"""Sends a POST request to the given url with the given body and parameters."""""" result = requests.post(url, json=body, params=parameters) return f""Status: {result.status_code} - {result.text}"" tool = StructuredTool.from_function(post_message) ``` ### Subclassing the BaseTool The BaseTool automatically infers the schema from the `_run` method\'s signature. ```python from typing import Optional, Type from langchain.callbacks.manager import ( AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun, CallbackManagerForToolRun, ) class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool): name = ""custom_search"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" def _run( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" search_wrapper = SerpAPIWrapper(params={""engine"": engine, ""gl"": gl, ""hl"": hl}) return search_wrapper.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"") # You can provide a custom args schema to add descriptions or custom validation class SearchSchema(BaseModel): query: str = Field(description=""should be a search query"") engine: str = Field(description=""should be a search engine"") gl: str = Field(description=""should be a country code"") hl: str = Field(description=""should be a language code"") class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool): name = ""custom_search"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" args_schema: Type[SearchSchema] = SearchSchema def _run( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" search_wrapper = SerpAPIWrapper(params={""engine"": engine, ""gl"": gl, ""hl"": hl}) return search_wrapper.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"") ``` ### Using the decorator The `tool` decorator creates a structured tool automatically if the signature has multiple arguments. ```python import requests from langchain.tools import tool @tool def post_message(url: str, body: dict, parameters: Optional[dict] = None) -> str: """"""Sends a POST request to the given url with the given body and parameters."""""" result = requests.post(url, json=body, params=parameters) return f""Status: {result.status_code} - {result.text}"" ``` ## Modify existing tools Now, we show how to load existing tools and modify them directly. In the example below, we do something really simple and change the Search tool to have the name `Google Search`. ```python from langchain.agents import load_tools ``` ```python tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm) ``` ```python tools[0].name = ""Google Search"" ``` ```python agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?

""The age of Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend raised to the 0.43 power is approximately 3.55."" ``` ## Defining the priorities among Tools When you made a Custom tool, you may want the Agent to use the custom tool more than normal tools. For example, you made a custom tool, which gets information on music from your database. When a user wants information on songs, You want the Agent to use `the custom tool` more than the normal `Search tool`. But the Agent might prioritize a normal Search tool. This can be accomplished by adding a statement such as `Use this more than the normal search if the question is about Music, like \'who is the singer of yesterday?\' or \'what is the most popular song in 2022?\'` to the description. An example is below. ```python # Import things that are needed generically from langchain.agents import AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent from langchain.chains import LLMMathChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper search = SerpAPIWrapper() tools = [ Tool( name=""Search"", func=search.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", ), Tool( name=""Music Search"", func=lambda x: ""\'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey."", # Mock Function description=""A Music search engine. Use this more than the normal search if the question is about Music, like \'who is the singer of yesterday?\' or \'what is the most popular song in 2022?\'"", ), ] agent = initialize_agent( tools, OpenAI(temperature=0), agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python agent.run(""what is the most famous song of christmas"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I should use a music search engine to find the answer Action: Music Search Action Input: most famous song of christmas\'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey. I now know the final answer Final Answer: \'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey. > Finished chain. ""\'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey."" ``` ## Using tools to return directly Often, it can be desirable to have a tool output returned directly to the user, if it\'s called. You can do this easily with LangChain by setting the `return_direct` flag for a tool to be True. ```python llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm) tools = [ Tool( name=""Calculator"", func=llm_math_chain.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"", return_direct=True, ) ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run(""whats 2**.12"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I need to calculate this Action: Calculator Action Input: 2**.12Answer: 1.086734862526058 > Finished chain. \'Answer: 1.086734862526058\' ``` ## Handling Tool Errors When a tool encounters an error and the exception is not caught, the agent will stop executing. If you want the agent to continue execution, you can raise a `ToolException` and set `handle_tool_error` accordingly. When `ToolException` is thrown, the agent will not stop working, but will handle the exception according to the `handle_tool_error` variable of the tool, and the processing result will be returned to the agent as observation, and printed in red.

It provides a Python SDK for interacting with your database, and a UI for managing your data. With the `XataChatMessageHistory` class, you can use Xata databases for longer-term persistence of chat sessions. This notebook covers: - A simple example showing what `XataChatMessageHistory` does. - A more complex example using a REACT agent that answer questions based on a knowledge based or documentation (stored in Xata as a vector store) and also having a long-term searchable history of its past messages (stored in Xata as a memory store) ## Setup ### Create a database In the [Xata UI]( create a new database. You can name it whatever you want, in this notepad we\'ll use `langchain`. The Langchain integration can auto-create the table used for storying the memory, and this is what we\'ll use in this example. If you want to pre-create the table, ensure it has the right schema and set `create_table` to `False` when creating the class. Pre-creating the table saves one round-trip to the database during each session initialization. Let\'s first install our dependencies: ```bash pip install xata openai langchain ``` Next, we need to get the environment variables for Xata. You can create a new API key by visiting your [account settings]( To find the database URL, go to the Settings page of the database that you have created. The database URL should look something like this: ` ```python import getpass api_key = getpass.getpass(""Xata API key: "") db_url = input(""Xata database URL (copy it from your DB settings):"") ``` ## Create a simple memory store To test the memory store functionality in isolation, let\'s use the following code snippet: ```python from langchain.memory import XataChatMessageHistory history = XataChatMessageHistory( session_id=""session-1"", api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""memory"" ) history.add_user_message(""hi!"") history.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` The above code creates a session with the ID `session-1` and stores two messages in it. After running the above, if you visit the Xata UI, you should see a table named `memory` and the two messages added to it. You can retrieve the message history for a particular session with the following code: ```python history.messages ``` ## Conversational Q&A chain on your data with memory Let\'s now see a more complex example in which we combine OpenAI, the Xata Vector Store integration, and the Xata memory store integration to create a Q&A chat bot on your data, with follow-up questions and history. We\'re going to need to access the OpenAI API, so let\'s configure the API key: ```python import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` To store the documents that the chatbot will search for answers, add a table named `docs` to your `langchain` database using the Xata UI, and add the following columns: - `content` of type ""Text"". This is used to store the `Document.pageContent` values. - `embedding` of type ""Vector"". Use the dimension used by the model you plan to use. In this notebook we use OpenAI embeddings, which have 1536 dimensions. Let\'s create the vector store and add some sample docs to it: ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores.xata import XataVectorStore embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() texts = [ ""Xata is a Serverless Data platform based on PostgreSQL"", ""Xata offers a built-in vector type that can be used to store and query vectors"", ""Xata includes similarity search"", ] vector_store = XataVectorStore.from_texts( texts, embeddings, api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""docs"" ) ``` After running the above command, if you go to the Xata UI, you should see the documents loaded together with their embeddings in the `docs` table. Let\'s now create a ConversationBufferMemory to store the chat messages from both the user and the AI. ```python from uuid import uuid4 from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory chat_memory = XataChatMessageHistory( session_id=str(uuid4()), # needs to be unique per user session api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""memory"", ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory( memory_key=""chat_history"", chat_memory=chat_memory, return_messages=True ) ``` Now it\'s time to create an Agent to use both the vector store and the chat memory together. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI tool = create_retriever_tool( vector_store.as_retriever(), ""search_docs"", ""Searches and returns documents from the Xata manual. Useful when you need to answer questions about Xata."", ) tools = [tool] llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` To test, let\'s tell the agent our name: ```python agent.run(input=""My name is bob"") ``` Now, let\'s now ask the agent some questions about Xata: ```python agent.run(input=""What is xata?"") ``` Notice that it answers based on the data stored in the document store. And now, let\'s ask a follow up question: ```python agent.run(input=""Does it support similarity search?"") ``` And now let\'s test its memory: ```python agent.run(input=""Did I tell you my name? What is it?"") ``` - [Setup](#setup)- [Create a database](#create-a-database) - [Create a simple memory store](#create-a-simple-memory-store) - [Conversational Q&A chain on your data with memory](#conversational-qa-chain-on-your-data-with-memory)', 'Replicating MRKL | Replicating MRKL This walkthrough demonstrates how to replicate the [MRKL]( system using agents.
