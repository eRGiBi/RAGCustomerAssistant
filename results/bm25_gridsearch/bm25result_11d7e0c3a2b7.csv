It enables applications that: - **Are context-aware**: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.) - **Reason**: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.) This framework consists of several parts. - **LangChain Libraries**: The Python and JavaScript libraries. Contains interfaces and integrations for a myriad of components, a basic run time for combining these components into chains and agents, and off-the-shelf implementations of chains and agents. - **LangChain Templates**: A collection of easily deployable reference architectures for a wide variety of tasks. - **LangServe**: A library for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API. - **LangSmith**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain. ![LangChain Diagram](/assets/images/langchain_stack-7bb980051b626aad30ec43647b717411.png) Together, these products simplify the entire application lifecycle: - **Develop**: Write your applications in LangChain/LangChain.js. Hit the ground running using Templates for reference. - **Productionize**: Use LangSmith to inspect, test and monitor your chains, so that you can constantly improve and deploy with confidence. - **Deploy**: Turn any chain into an API with LangServe. ## LangChain Libraries The main value props of the LangChain packages are: 1. **Components**: composable tools and integrations for working with language models. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not 2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: built-in assemblages of components for accomplishing higher-level tasks Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. Components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones. ## Get started [Here's](/docs/get_started/installation) how to install LangChain, set up your environment, and start building. We recommend following our [Quickstart](/docs/get_started/quickstart) guide to familiarize yourself with the framework by building your first LangChain application. Read up on our [Security](/docs/security) best practices to make sure you're developing safely with LangChain. noteThese docs focus on the Python LangChain library. [Head here]( for docs on the JavaScript LangChain library. ## LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) LCEL is a declarative way to compose chains. LCEL was designed from day 1 to support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest prompt + LLM chain to the most complex chains. - **Overview**: LCEL and its benefits - **Interface**: The standard interface for LCEL objects - **How-to**: Key features of LCEL - **Cookbook**: Example code for accomplishing common tasks ## Modules LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and integrations for the following modules: #### Model I/O Interface with language models #### Retrieval Interface with application-specific data #### Agents Let models choose which tools to use given high-level directives ## Examples, ecosystem, and resources ### Use cases Walkthroughs and techniques for common end-to-end use cases, like: - [Document question answering](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/) - [Chatbots](/docs/use_cases/chatbots/) - [Analyzing structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql/) - and much more... ### Integrations LangChain is part of a rich ecosystem of tools that integrate with our framework and build on top of it.

A callback handler, also known as a callback function or callback method, is a piece of code that is executed in response to a specific event or condition. It is commonly used in programming languages that support event-driven or asynchronous programming paradigms. The purpose of a callback handler is to provide a way for developers to define custom behavior that should be executed when a certain event occurs. Instead of waiting for a result or blocking the execution, the program registers a callback function and continues with other tasks. When the event is triggered, the callback function is invoked, allowing the program to respond accordingly. Callback handlers are commonly used in various scenarios, such as handling user input, responding to network requests, processing asynchronous operations, and implementing event-driven architectures. They provide a flexible and modular way to handle events and decouple different components of a system. >>> input >>> >>>: What do I need to do to get the full benefits of this To get the full benefits of using a callback handler, you should consider the following: 1. Understand the event or condition: Identify the specific event or condition that you want to respond to with a callback handler. This could be user input, network requests, or any other asynchronous operation. 2. Define the callback function: Create a function that will be executed when the event or condition occurs. This function should contain the desired behavior or actions you want to take in response to the event. 3. Register the callback function: Depending on the programming language or framework you are using, you may need to register or attach the callback function to the appropriate event or condition. This ensures that the callback function is invoked when the event occurs. 4. Handle the callback: Implement the necessary logic within the callback function to handle the event or condition. This could involve updating the user interface, processing data, making further requests, or triggering other actions. 5. Consider error handling: It\'s important to handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur within the callback function. This ensures that your program can gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent crashes or undesired behavior. 6. Maintain code readability and modularity: As your codebase grows, it\'s crucial to keep your callback handlers organized and maintainable. Consider using design patterns or architectural principles to structure your code in a modular and scalable way. By following these steps, you can leverage the benefits of callback handlers, such as asynchronous and event-driven programming, improved responsiveness, and modular code design. >>> input >>> >>>: q ```', 'Chatbots | Chatbots []( ## Use case Chatbots are one of the central LLM use-cases. The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

Human: hi > Finished chain. {\'question\': \'hi\', \'chat_history\': [HumanMessage(content=\'hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'Hello!

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1. Simple prompting: Agents can use Language Model based prompting to break down tasks into subgoals. For example, by providing prompts like ""Steps for XYZ"" or ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", the agent can generate a sequence of smaller steps that lead to the completion of the overall task.\\n\\n2. Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to ""Write a story outline."" This provides a high-level structure for the task and helps in breaking it down into smaller components.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Agents can also take inputs from humans to decompose tasks. This can be done through direct communication or by leveraging human expertise. Humans can provide guidance and insights to help the agent break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals.\\n\\nOverall, task decomposition allows agents to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals, enabling them to plan and execute complex tasks efficiently.\'} ``` ```python qa(""What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'The human asks how agents use task decomposition. The AI explains that agents can use task decomposition in several ways, including simple prompting, task-specific instructions, and human inputs. Task decomposition allows agents to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals, enabling them to plan and execute complex tasks efficiently.\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'There are several ways to implement memory to support task decomposition:\\n\\n1. Long-Term Memory Management: This involves storing and organizing information in a long-term memory system. The agent can retrieve past experiences, knowledge, and learned strategies to guide the task decomposition process.\\n\\n2. Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents. This allows for easy retrieval and reference during the execution of the task.\\n\\nThese memory resources help the agent in organizing and managing information, making informed decisions, and effectively decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals.\'} ``` Again, we can use the [LangSmith trace]( to explore the prompt structure. ### Going deeper - Agents, such as the [conversational retrieval agent](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents), can be used for retrieval when necessary while also holding a conversation. - [Use case](#use-case) - [Overview](#overview) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Memory](#memory) - [Conversation](#conversation) - [Chat Retrieval](#chat-retrieval)- [Going deeper](#going-deeper)']","LangChain offers several benefits for building chatbots:

Let\'s move forward and see how to enable and configure Aim callback. ### Tracking LangChain Executions with Aim In this notebook we will explore three usage scenarios. To start off, we will install the necessary packages and import certain modules. Subsequently, we will configure two environment variables that can be established either within the Python script or through the terminal. ```bash pip install aim pip install langchain pip install openai pip install google-search-results ``` ```python import os from datetime import datetime from langchain.callbacks import AimCallbackHandler, StdOutCallbackHandler from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` Our examples use a GPT model as the LLM, and OpenAI offers an API for this purpose. You can obtain the key from the following link: [ . We will use the SerpApi to retrieve search results from Google. To acquire the SerpApi key, please go to [ . ```python os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = ""..."" os.environ[""SERPAPI_API_KEY""] = ""..."" ``` The event methods of `AimCallbackHandler` accept the LangChain module or agent as input and log at least the prompts and generated results, as well as the serialized version of the LangChain module, to the designated Aim run. ```python session_group = datetime.now().strftime(""%m.%d.%Y_%H.%M.%S"") aim_callback = AimCallbackHandler( repo=""."", experiment_name=""scenario 1: OpenAI LLM"", ) callbacks = [StdOutCallbackHandler(), aim_callback] llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, callbacks=callbacks) ``` The `flush_tracker` function is used to record LangChain assets on Aim. By default, the session is reset rather than being terminated outright. ### Scenario 1 In the first scenario, we will use OpenAI LLM.```python # scenario 1 - LLM llm_result = llm.generate([""Tell me a joke"", ""Tell me a poem""] * 3) aim_callback.flush_tracker( langchain_asset=llm, experiment_name=""scenario 2: Chain with multiple SubChains on multiple generations"", ) ``` ### Scenario 2 Scenario two involves chaining with multiple SubChains across multiple generations.```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` ```python # scenario 2 - Chain template = """"""You are a playwright.

llm1 = HuggingFaceLLM(model_name=""model1"")
llm2 = OpenAssistantLLM(model_name=""model2"")

2,Can I use custom embeddings with LangChain?,"['Dynamically route logic based on input | Dynamically route logic based on input This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language. Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`. Do not respond with more than one word. {question} Classification:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I call Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text \' Anthropic\' ``` Now, let\'s create three sub chains: ```python langchain_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in langchain. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Harrison Chase told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) anthropic_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in anthropic. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Dario Amodei told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) general_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch branch = RunnableBranch( (lambda x: ""anthropic"" in x[""topic""].lower(), anthropic_chain), (lambda x: ""langchain"" in x[""topic""].lower(), langchain_chain), general_chain, ) ``` ```python full_chain = {""topic"": chain, ""question"": lambda x: x[""question""]} | branch ``` ```python full_chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I use Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content="" As Dario Amodei told me, here are some ways to use Anthropic:\\n\\n- Sign up for an account on Anthropic\'s website to access tools like Claude, Constitutional AI, and Writer. \\n\\n- Use Claude for tasks like email generation, customer service chat, and QA.

Before we dive in, please note that any specific grade from an LLM should be taken with a grain of salt. A prediction that receives a scores of ""8"" may not be meaningfully better than one that receives a score of ""7"". ### Usage with Ground Truth For a thorough understanding, refer to the [LabeledScoreStringEvalChain documentation]( Below is an example demonstrating the usage of `LabeledScoreStringEvalChain` using the default prompt: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_score_string"", llm=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"")) ``` ```python # Correct eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""You can find them in the dresser\'s third drawer."", reference=""The socks are in the third drawer in the dresser"", input=""Where are my socks?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The assistant\'s response is helpful, accurate, and directly answers the user\'s question.

It is commonly used in programming languages that support event-driven or asynchronous programming paradigms. The purpose of a callback handler is to provide a way for developers to define custom behavior that should be executed when a certain event occurs. Instead of waiting for a result or blocking the execution, the program registers a callback function and continues with other tasks. When the event is triggered, the callback function is invoked, allowing the program to respond accordingly. Callback handlers are commonly used in various scenarios, such as handling user input, responding to network requests, processing asynchronous operations, and implementing event-driven architectures. They provide a flexible and modular way to handle events and decouple different components of a system. >>> input >>> >>>: What do I need to do to get the full benefits of this To get the full benefits of using a callback handler, you should consider the following: 1. Understand the event or condition: Identify the specific event or condition that you want to respond to with a callback handler. This could be user input, network requests, or any other asynchronous operation. 2. Define the callback function: Create a function that will be executed when the event or condition occurs. This function should contain the desired behavior or actions you want to take in response to the event. 3. Register the callback function: Depending on the programming language or framework you are using, you may need to register or attach the callback function to the appropriate event or condition. This ensures that the callback function is invoked when the event occurs. 4. Handle the callback: Implement the necessary logic within the callback function to handle the event or condition. This could involve updating the user interface, processing data, making further requests, or triggering other actions. 5. Consider error handling: It\'s important to handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur within the callback function. This ensures that your program can gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent crashes or undesired behavior. 6. Maintain code readability and modularity: As your codebase grows, it\'s crucial to keep your callback handlers organized and maintainable. Consider using design patterns or architectural principles to structure your code in a modular and scalable way. By following these steps, you can leverage the benefits of callback handlers, such as asynchronous and event-driven programming, improved responsiveness, and modular code design. >>> input >>> >>>: q ```', 'Add fallbacks | Add fallbacks There are many possible points of failure in an LLM application, whether that be issues with LLM API\'s, poor model outputs, issues with other integrations, etc. Fallbacks help you gracefully handle and isolate these issues. Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. ## Handling LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things. Therefore, using fallbacks can help protect against these types of things. IMPORTANT: By default, a lot of the LLM wrappers catch errors and retry. You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying and not failing. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI ``` First, let\'s mock out what happens if we hit a RateLimitError from OpenAI ```python from unittest.mock import patch from openai.error import RateLimitError ``` ```python # Note that we set max_retries = 0 to avoid retrying on RateLimits, etc openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0) anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic() llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm]) ``` ```python # Let\'s use just the OpenAI LLm first, to show that we run into an error with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(openai_llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ```python # Now let\'s try with fallbacks to Anthropic with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content=\' I don\\\'t actually know why the chicken crossed the road, but here are some possible humorous answers:\\n\\n- To get to the other side!\\n\\n- It was too chicken to just stand there. \\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\n- It wanted to show the possum it could be done.\\n\\n- It was on its way to a poultry farmers\\\' convention.\\n\\nThe joke plays on the double meaning of ""the other side"" - literally crossing the road to the other side, or the ""other side"" meaning the afterlife. So it\\\'s an anti-joke, with a silly or unexpected pun as the answer.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` We can use our ""LLM with Fallbacks"" as we would a normal LLM. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content="" I don\'t actually know why the kangaroo crossed the road, but I\'m happy to take a guess! Maybe the kangaroo was trying to get to the other side to find some tasty grass to eat. Or maybe it was trying to get away from a predator or other danger. Kangaroos do need to cross roads and other open areas sometimes as part of their normal activities. Whatever the reason, I\'m sure the kangaroo looked both ways before hopping across!"" additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ### Specifying errors to handle We can also specify the errors to handle if we want to be more specific about when the fallback is invoked: ```python llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks( [anthropic_llm], exceptions_to_handle=(KeyboardInterrupt,) ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ## Fallbacks for Sequences We can also create fallbacks for sequences, that are sequences themselves. Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model). Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt. ```python # First let\'s create a chain with a ChatModel # We add in a string output parser here so the outputs between the two are the same type from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) # Here we\'re going to use a bad model name to easily create a chain that will error chat_model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"") bad_chain = chat_prompt | chat_model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python # Now lets create a chain with the normal OpenAI model from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = """"""Instructions: You should always include a compliment in your response. Question: Why did the {animal} cross the road?"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template) llm = OpenAI() good_chain = prompt | llm ``` ```python # We can now create a final chain which combines the two chain = bad_chain.with_fallbacks([good_chain]) chain.invoke({""animal"": ""turtle""}) ``` ```text \'\\n\\nAnswer: The turtle crossed the road to get to the other side, and I have to say he had some impressive determination.\' ``` - [Handling LLM API Errors](#handling-llm-api-errors)- [Specifying errors to handle](#specifying-errors-to-handle) - [Fallbacks for Sequences](#fallbacks-for-sequences)']","To handle API response errors in LangChain, consider implementing fallbacks. This involves setting up alternative models or sequences to take over when the primary model encounters an error, such as a rate limit. Here's a brief approach:

1. **Disable Default Retries**: Turn off automatic retries in your primary model to allow fallbacks to handle errors.
2. **Set Up Fallbacks**: Use the `.with_fallbacks()` method to define alternative models that will be invoked if the primary model fails.
3. **Test with Mock Errors**: Use `patch` to simulate errors and ensure your fallbacks work as expected.

Example:
```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI, ChatAnthropic
from unittest.mock import patch

openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0)
anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic()
llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm])

with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()):
    try:
        print(llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?""))
    except:
        print(""Hit error"")
```

This method ensures your application remains functional even when the primary API encounters issues.","In LangChain, you can handle API response errors by implementing error handling logic within your agent or chain. Use try-except blocks to catch exceptions and define fallback strategies, such as switching to a backup model or retrying the request after a delay.",0.3333333333,1.0,,0.14012485592337465,0.1463414634146341
4,How can I improve the performance of my LangChain model?,"['Memory in LLMChain | Memory in LLMChain This notebook goes over how to use the Memory class with an `LLMChain`. We will add the [ConversationBufferMemory]( class, although this can be any memory class. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` The most important step is setting up the prompt correctly. In the below prompt, we have two input keys: one for the actual input, another for the input from the Memory class. Importantly, we make sure the keys in the `PromptTemplate` and the `ConversationBufferMemory` match up (`chat_history`). ```python template = """"""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. {chat_history} Human: {human_input} Chatbot:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""chat_history"", ""human_input""], template=template ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend Chatbot: > Finished chain. \' Hi there! How can I help you today?\' ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Not too bad - how are you?"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend AI: Hi there! How can I help you today? Human: Not too bad - how are you? Chatbot: > Finished chain. "" I\'m doing great, thanks for asking! How are you doing?"" ``` ## Adding Memory to a chat model-based LLMChain The above works for completion-style `LLM`s, but if you are using a chat model, you will likely get better performance using structured chat messages. Below is an example. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, ) from langchain.schema import SystemMessage ``` We will use the [ChatPromptTemplate]( class to set up the chat prompt. The [from_messages]( method creates a `ChatPromptTemplate` from a list of messages (e.g., `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ChatMessage`, etc.) or message templates, such as the [MessagesPlaceholder]( below. The configuration below makes it so the memory will be injected to the middle of the chat prompt, in the `chat_history` key, and the user\'s inputs will be added in a human/user message to the end of the chat prompt. ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The persistent system prompt MessagesPlaceholder( variable_name=""chat_history"" ), # Where the memory will be stored. HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""{human_input}"" ), # Where the human input will injected ] ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI() chat_llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: System: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend > Finished chain. \'Hello! How can I assist you today, my friend?\' ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Not too bad - how are you?"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: System: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend AI: Hello! How can I assist you today, my friend?

Examples include circular reasoning, false dichotomies, ad hominem attacks, etc. Machine learning models are optimized to perform well on specific metrics like accuracy, perplexity, or loss. However, optimizing for metrics alone does not guarantee logically sound reasoning. Language models can learn to exploit flaws in reasoning to generate plausible-sounding but logically invalid arguments. When models rely on fallacies, their outputs become unreliable and untrustworthy, even if they achieve high scores on metrics. Users cannot depend on such outputs. Propagating logical fallacies can spread misinformation, confuse users, and lead to harmful real-world consequences when models are deployed in products or services. Monitoring and testing specifically for logical flaws is challenging unlike other quality issues. It requires reasoning about arguments rather than pattern matching. Therefore, it is crucial that model developers proactively address logical fallacies after optimizing metrics. Specialized techniques like causal modeling, robustness testing, and bias mitigation can help avoid flawed reasoning. Overall, allowing logical flaws to persist makes models less safe and ethical. Eliminating fallacies ensures model outputs remain logically valid and aligned with human reasoning. This maintains user trust and mitigates risks. ## Example ```python # Imports from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain_experimental.fallacy_removal.base import FallacyChain ``` ```python # Example of a model output being returned with a logical fallacy misleading_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=""""""You have to respond by using only logical fallacies inherent in your answer explanations.

It supports two endpoint types: - Serving endpoint, recommended for production and development, - Cluster driver proxy app, recommended for iteractive development. ```python from langchain.llms import Databricks ``` ## Wrapping a serving endpoint Prerequisites: - An LLM was registered and deployed to [a Databricks serving endpoint]( - You have [""Can Query"" permission]( to the endpoint. The expected MLflow model signature is: - inputs: `[{""name"": ""prompt"", ""type"": ""string""}, {""name"": ""stop"", ""type"": ""list[string]""}]` - outputs: `[{""type"": ""string""}]` If the model signature is incompatible or you want to insert extra configs, you can set `transform_input_fn` and `transform_output_fn` accordingly. ```python # If running a Databricks notebook attached to an interactive cluster in ""single user"" # or ""no isolation shared"" mode, you only need to specify the endpoint name to create # a `Databricks` instance to query a serving endpoint in the same workspace. llm = Databricks(endpoint_name=""dolly"") llm(""How are you?"") ``` ```text \'I am happy to hear that you are in good health and as always, you are appreciated.\' ``` ```python llm(""How are you?"", stop=["".""]) ``` ```text \'Good\' ``` ```python # Otherwise, you can manually specify the Databricks workspace hostname and personal access token # or set `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` environment variables, respectively. # See # We strongly recommend not exposing the API token explicitly inside a notebook. # You can use Databricks secret manager to store your API token securely. # See import os os.environ[""DATABRICKS_TOKEN""] = dbutils.secrets.get(""myworkspace"", ""api_token"") llm = Databricks(host=""myworkspace.cloud.databricks.com"", endpoint_name=""dolly"") llm(""How are you?"") ``` ```text \'I am fine.

You?\' ``` ## Wrapping a cluster driver proxy app Prerequisites: - An LLM loaded on a Databricks interactive cluster in ""single user"" or ""no isolation shared"" mode. - A local HTTP server running on the driver node to serve the model at `""/""` using HTTP POST with JSON input/output. - It uses a port number between `[3000, 8000]` and listens to the driver IP address or simply `0.0.0.0` instead of localhost only. - You have ""Can Attach To"" permission to the cluster. The expected server schema (using JSON schema) is: - inputs:```json {""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""prompt"": {""type"": ""string""}, ""stop"": {""type"": ""array"", ""items"": {""type"": ""string""}}}, ""required"": [""prompt""]} ``` - outputs: `{""type"": ""string""}` If the server schema is incompatible or you want to insert extra configs, you can use `transform_input_fn` and `transform_output_fn` accordingly. The following is a minimal example for running a driver proxy app to serve an LLM: ```python from flask import Flask, request, jsonify import torch from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer, StoppingCriteria model = ""databricks/dolly-v2-3b"" tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model, padding_side=""left"") dolly = pipeline(model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, trust_remote_code=True, device_map=""auto"") device = dolly.device class CheckStop(StoppingCriteria): def __init__(self, stop=None): super().__init__() self.stop = stop or [] self.matched = """" self.stop_ids = [tokenizer.encode(s, return_tensors=\'pt\').to(device) for s in self.stop] def __call__(self, input_ids: torch.LongTensor, scores: torch.FloatTensor, **kwargs): for i, s in enumerate(self.stop_ids): if torch.all((s == input_ids[0][-s.shape[1]:])).item(): self.matched = self.stop[i] return True return False def llm(prompt, stop=None, **kwargs): check_stop = CheckStop(stop) result = dolly(prompt, stopping_criteria=[check_stop], **kwargs) return result[0][""generated_text""].rstrip(check_stop.matched) app = Flask(""dolly"") @app.route(\'/\', methods=[\'POST\']) def serve_llm(): resp = llm(**request.json) return jsonify(resp) app.run(host=""0.0.0.0"", port=""7777"") ``` Once the server is running, you can create a `Databricks` instance to wrap it as an LLM. ```python # If running a Databricks notebook attached to the same cluster that runs the app, # you only need to specify the driver port to create a `Databricks` instance. llm = Databricks(cluster_driver_port=""7777"") llm(""How are you?"") ``` ```text \'Hello, thank you for asking.

6,what's the strict argument in the json output function parser mean?,"['Pairwise string comparison | Pairwise string comparison []( Often you will want to compare predictions of an LLM, Chain, or Agent for a given input. The `StringComparison` evaluators facilitate this so you can answer questions like: - Which LLM or prompt produces a preferred output for a given question? - Which examples should I include for few-shot example selection? - Which output is better to include for fine-tuning? The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `pairwise_string` evaluator. Check out the reference docs for the [PairwiseStringEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are relevant to the question asked, as they both provide a numerical answer to the question about the number of dogs in the park. However, Response A is incorrect according to the reference answer, which states that there are four dogs. Response B, on the other hand, is correct as it matches the reference answer. Neither response demonstrates depth of thought, as they both simply provide a numerical answer without any additional information or context. \\n\\nBased on these criteria, Response B is the better response.\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Methods The pairwise string evaluator can be called using [evaluate_string_pairs]( (or async [aevaluate_string_pairs]( methods, which accept: - prediction (str) The predicted response of the first model, chain, or prompt. - prediction_b (str) The predicted response of the second model, chain, or prompt. - input (str) The input question, prompt, or other text. - reference (str) (Only for the labeled_pairwise_string variant) The reference response. They return a dictionary with the following values: - value: \'A\' or \'B\', indicating whether `prediction` or `prediction_b` is preferred, respectively - score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the \'value\', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `prediction_b` is preferred. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Without References When references aren\'t available, you can still predict the preferred response. The results will reflect the evaluation model\'s preference, which is less reliable and may result in preferences that are factually incorrect. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Addition is a mathematical operation."", prediction_b=""Addition is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers to create a third number, the \'sum\'."", input=""What is addition?"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are correct and relevant to the question. However, Response B is more helpful and insightful as it provides a more detailed explanation of what addition is. Response A is correct but lacks depth as it does not explain what the operation of addition entails. \\n\\nFinal Decision: [[B]]\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Defining the Criteria By default, the LLM is instructed to select the \'preferred\' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms: - [Criteria]( enum or its string value - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions - [Constitutional principal]( - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain - Dictionary: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description. - A list of criteria or constitutional principles - to combine multiple criteria in one. Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style. ```python custom_criteria = { ""simplicity"": ""Is the language straightforward and unpretentious?"", ""clarity"": ""Are the sentences clear and easy to understand?"", ""precision"": ""Is the writing precise, with no unnecessary words or details?"", ""truthfulness"": ""Does the writing feel honest and sincere?"", ""subtext"": ""Does the writing suggest deeper meanings or themes?"", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"", criteria=custom_criteria) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Every cheerful household shares a similar rhythm of joy; but sorrow, in each household, plays a unique, haunting melody."", prediction_b=""Where one finds a symphony of joy, every domicile of happiness resounds in harmonious,"" "" identical notes; yet, every abode of despair conducts a dissonant orchestra, each"" "" playing an elegy of grief that is peculiar and profound to its own existence."", input=""Write some prose about families."", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Response A is simple, clear, and precise. It uses straightforward language to convey a deep and sincere message about families. The metaphor of joy and sorrow as music is effective and easy to understand.\\n\\nResponse B, on the other hand, is more complex and less clear. The language is more pretentious, with words like ""domicile,"" ""resounds,"" ""abode,"" ""dissonant,"" and ""elegy."" While it conveys a similar message to Response A, it does so in a more convoluted way. The precision is also lacking due to the use of unnecessary words and details.\\n\\nBoth responses suggest deeper meanings or themes about the shared joy and unique sorrow in families. However, Response A does so in a more effective and accessible way.\\n\\nTherefore, the better response is [[A]].\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` ## Customize the LLM By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain. You can customize this when loading. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"", llm=llm) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Here is my assessment:\\n\\nResponse B is more helpful, insightful, and accurate than Response A. Response B simply states ""4"", which directly answers the question by providing the exact number of dogs mentioned in the reference answer. In contrast, Response A states ""there are three dogs"", which is incorrect according to the reference answer. \\n\\nIn terms of helpfulness, Response B gives the precise number while Response A provides an inaccurate guess. For relevance, both refer to dogs in the park from the question. However, Response B is more correct and factual based on the reference answer. Response A shows some attempt at reasoning but is ultimately incorrect. Response B requires less depth of thought to simply state the factual number.\\n\\nIn summary, Response B is superior in terms of helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth. My final decision is: [[B]]\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Customize the Evaluation Prompt You can use your own custom evaluation prompt to add more task-specific instructions or to instruct the evaluator to score the output. *Note: If you use a prompt that expects generates a result in a unique format, you may also have to pass in a custom output parser (`output_parser=your_parser()`) instead of the default `PairwiseStringResultOutputParser` ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the input context, which do you prefer: A or B? Evaluate based on the following criteria: {criteria} Reason step by step and finally, respond with either [[A]] or [[B]] on its own line.

7,what's stuff mean in chain_type=stuff,"['Parallelize steps | Parallelize steps RunnableParallel (aka. RunnableMap) makes it easy to execute multiple Runnables in parallel, and to return the output of these Runnables as a map. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableParallel model = ChatOpenAI() joke_chain = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""tell me a joke about {topic}"") | model poem_chain = ( ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""write a 2-line poem about {topic}"") | model ) map_chain = RunnableParallel(joke=joke_chain, poem=poem_chain) map_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bear""}) ``` ```text {\'joke\': AIMessage(content=""Why don\'t bears wear shoes? \\n\\nBecause they have bear feet!"", additional_kwargs={}, example=False), \'poem\': AIMessage(content=""In woodland depths, bear prowls with might,\\nSilent strength, nature\'s sovereign, day and night."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False)} ``` ## Manipulating outputs/inputs Maps can be useful for manipulating the output of one Runnable to match the input format of the next Runnable in a sequence. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS vectorstore = FAISS.from_texts( [""harrison worked at kensho""], embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings() ) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() template = """"""Answer the question based only on the following context: {context} Question: {question} """""" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template) retrieval_chain = ( {""context"": retriever, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ) retrieval_chain.invoke(""where did harrison work?"") ``` ```text \'Harrison worked at Kensho.\' ``` Here the input to prompt is expected to be a map with keys ""context"" and ""question"". The user input is just the question. So we need to get the context using our retriever and passthrough the user input under the ""question"" key. Note that when composing a RunnableMap when another Runnable we don\'t even need to wrap our dictionary in the RunnableMap class the type conversion is handled for us. ## Parallelism RunnableMaps are also useful for running independent processes in parallel, since each Runnable in the map is executed in parallel.

Grab some docset and document IDs for your processed documents, as described here: [ ```bash # You need the lxml package to use the DocugamiLoader (run pip install directly without ""poetry run"" if you are not using poetry) poetry run pip install lxml --quiet ``` ## Quick start 1. Create a [Docugami workspace]( (free trials available) 2. Add your documents (PDF, DOCX or DOC) and allow Docugami to ingest and cluster them into sets of similar documents, e.g. NDAs, Lease Agreements, and Service Agreements. There is no fixed set of document types supported by the system, the clusters created depend on your particular documents, and you can [change the docset assignments]( later. 3. Create an access token via the Developer Playground for your workspace. [Detailed instructions]( 4. Explore the [Docugami API]( to get a list of your processed docset IDs, or just the document IDs for a particular docset. 5. Use the DocugamiLoader as detailed below, to get rich semantic chunks for your documents. 6. Optionally, build and publish one or more [reports or abstracts]( This helps Docugami improve the semantic XML with better tags based on your preferences, which are then added to the DocugamiLoader output as metadata. Use techniques like [self-querying retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/self_query/) to do high accuracy Document QA. ## Advantages vs Other Chunking Techniques Appropriate chunking of your documents is critical for retrieval from documents. Many chunking techniques exist, including simple ones that rely on whitespace and recursive chunk splitting based on character length. Docugami offers a different approach: 1. **Intelligent Chunking:** Docugami breaks down every document into a hierarchical semantic XML tree of chunks of varying sizes, from single words or numerical values to entire sections. These chunks follow the semantic contours of the document, providing a more meaningful representation than arbitrary length or simple whitespace-based chunking. 2. **Structured Representation:** In addition, the XML tree indicates the structural contours of every document, using attributes denoting headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other common elements, and does that consistently across all supported document formats, such as scanned PDFs or DOCX files. It appropriately handles long-form document characteristics like page headers/footers or multi-column flows for clean text extraction. 3. **Semantic Annotations:** Chunks are annotated with semantic tags that are coherent across the document set, facilitating consistent hierarchical queries across multiple documents, even if they are written and formatted differently. For example, in set of lease agreements, you can easily identify key provisions like the Landlord, Tenant, or Renewal Date, as well as more complex information such as the wording of any sub-lease provision or whether a specific jurisdiction has an exception section within a Termination Clause. 4. **Additional Metadata:** Chunks are also annotated with additional metadata, if a user has been using Docugami. This additional metadata can be used for high-accuracy Document QA without context window restrictions. See detailed code walk-through below. ```python import os from langchain.document_loaders import DocugamiLoader ``` ## Load Documents If the DOCUGAMI_API_KEY environment variable is set, there is no need to pass it in to the loader explicitly otherwise you can pass it in as the `access_token` parameter. The DocugamiLoader has a default minimum chunk size of 32. Chunks smaller than that are appended to subsequent chunks. Set min_chunk_size to 0 to get all structural chunks regardless of size. ```python DOCUGAMI_API_KEY = os.environ.get(""DOCUGAMI_API_KEY"") # To load all docs in the given docset ID, just don\'t provide document_ids loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=""ecxqpipcoe2p"", document_ids=[""43rj0ds7s0ur""]) docs = loader.load() docs ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (this Agreement ) is entered into and made effective as of April 4 , 2018 between Docugami Inc. , a Delaware corporation , whose address is 150 Lake Street South , Suite 221 , Kirkland , Washington 98033 , and Caleb Divine , an individual, whose address is 1201 Rt 300 , Newburgh NY 12550 .\', metadata={\'xpath\': \'/docset:MutualNon-disclosure/docset:MutualNon-disclosure/docset:MUTUALNON-DISCLOSUREAGREEMENT-section/docset:MUTUALNON-DISCLOSUREAGREEMENT/docset:ThisMutualNon-disclosureAgreement\', \'id\': \'43rj0ds7s0ur\', \'source\': \'NDA simple layout.docx\', \'structure\': \'p\', \'tag\': \'ThisMutualNon-disclosureAgreement\'}), Document(page_content=\'The above named parties desire to engage in discussions regarding a potential agreement or other transaction between the parties (the Purpose).

Useful for source citations directly to the actual chunk inside the document XML. 3. **structure:** Structural attributes of the chunk, e.g. h1, h2, div, table, td, etc. Useful to filter out certain kinds of chunks if needed by the caller. 4. **tag:** Semantic tag for the chunk, using various generative and extractive techniques. More details here: [ ## Basic Use: Docugami Loader for Document QA You can use the Docugami Loader like a standard loader for Document QA over multiple docs, albeit with much better chunks that follow the natural contours of the document. There are many great tutorials on how to do this, e.g. [this one]( We can just use the same code, but use the `DocugamiLoader` for better chunking, instead of loading text or PDF files directly with basic splitting techniques. ```bash poetry run pip -q install openai tiktoken chromadb ``` ```python from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma # For this example, we already have a processed docset for a set of lease documents loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=""wh2kned25uqm"") documents = loader.load() ``` The documents returned by the loader are already split, so we don\'t need to use a text splitter. Optionally, we can use the metadata on each document, for example the structure or tag attributes, to do any post-processing we want. We will just use the output of the `DocugamiLoader` as-is to set up a retrieval QA chain the usual way. ```python embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=documents, embedding=embedding) retriever = vectordb.as_retriever() qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type( llm=OpenAI(), chain_type=""stuff"", retriever=retriever, return_source_documents=True ) ``` ```python # Try out the retriever with an example query qa_chain(""What can tenants do with signage on their properties?"") ``` ```text {\'query\': \'What can tenants do with signage on their properties?\', \'result\': "" Tenants can place or attach signs (digital or otherwise) to their premises with written permission from the landlord.

Typical chunking techniques, even with overlap, will struggle with providing the LLM sufficent context to answer such questions. With upcoming very large context LLMs, it may be possible to stuff a lot of tokens, perhaps even entire documents, inside the context but this will still hit limits at some point with very long documents, or a lot of documents. For example, if we ask a more complex question that requires the LLM to draw on chunks from different parts of the document, even OpenAI\'s powerful LLM is unable to answer correctly. ```python chain_response = qa_chain(""What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?"") chain_response[""result""] # correct answer should be 13,500 sq ft ``` ```text \' 9,753 square feet.\' ``` At first glance the answer may seem reasonable, but if you review the source chunks carefully for this answer, you will see that the chunking of the document did not end up putting the Landlord name and the rentable area in the same context, since they are far apart in the document. The retriever therefore ends up finding unrelated chunks from other documents not even related to the **DHA Group** landlord. That landlord happens to be mentioned on the first page of the file **Shorebucks LLC_NJ.pdf** file, and while one of the source chunks used by the chain is indeed from that doc that contains the correct answer (**13,500**), other source chunks from different docs are included, and the answer is therefore incorrect. ```python chain_response[""source_documents""] ``` ```text [Document(page_content=\'1.1 Landlord .

There does not appear to be solid consensus on how best to do few-shot prompting, and the optimal prompt compilation will likely vary by model. Because of this, we provide few-shot prompt templates like the [FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate]( as a flexible starting point, and you can modify or replace them as you see fit. The goal of few-shot prompt templates are to dynamically select examples based on an input, and then format the examples in a final prompt to provide for the model. **Note:** The following code examples are for chat models. For similar few-shot prompt examples for completion models (LLMs), see the [few-shot prompt templates](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/few_shot_examples) guide. ### Fixed Examples The most basic (and common) few-shot prompting technique is to use a fixed prompt example. This way you can select a chain, evaluate it, and avoid worrying about additional moving parts in production. The basic components of the template are: - `examples`: A list of dictionary examples to include in the final prompt. - `example_prompt`: converts each example into 1 or more messages through its [format_messages]( method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message. Below is a simple demonstration. First, import the modules for this example: ```python from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate, ) ``` Then, define the examples you\'d like to include. ```python examples = [ {""input"": ""2+2"", ""output"": ""4""}, {""input"": ""2+3"", ""output"": ""5""}, ] ``` Next, assemble them into the few-shot prompt template. ```python # This is a prompt template used to format each individual example. example_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""human"", ""{input}""), (""ai"", ""{output}""), ] ) few_shot_prompt = FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate( example_prompt=example_prompt, examples=examples, ) print(few_shot_prompt.format()) ``` ```text Human: 2+2 AI: 4 Human: 2+3 AI: 5 ``` Finally, assemble your final prompt and use it with a model. ```python final_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a wondrous wizard of math.""), few_shot_prompt, (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic chain = final_prompt | ChatAnthropic(temperature=0.0) chain.invoke({""input"": ""What\'s the square of a triangle?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\' Triangles do not have a ""square"". A square refers to a shape with 4 equal sides and 4 right angles. Triangles have 3 sides and 3 angles.\\n\\nThe area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:\\n\\nA = 1/2 * b * h\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\nA is the area \\nb is the base (the length of one of the sides)\\nh is the height (the length from the base to the opposite vertex)\\n\\nSo the area depends on the specific dimensions of the triangle. There is no single ""square of a triangle"". The area can vary greatly depending on the base and height measurements.\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` ## Dynamic few-shot prompting Sometimes you may want to condition which examples are shown based on the input. For this, you can replace the `examples` with an `example_selector`. The other components remain the same as above! To review, the dynamic few-shot prompt template would look like: - `example_selector`: responsible for selecting few-shot examples (and the order in which they are returned) for a given input. These implement the [BaseExampleSelector]( interface. A common example is the vectorstore-backed [SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector]( - `example_prompt`: convert each example into 1 or more messages through its [format_messages]( method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message. These once again can be composed with other messages and chat templates to assemble your final prompt. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.prompts import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` Since we are using a vectorstore to select examples based on semantic similarity, we will want to first populate the store. ```python examples = [ {""input"": ""2+2"", ""output"": ""4""}, {""input"": ""2+3"", ""output"": ""5""}, {""input"": ""2+4"", ""output"": ""6""}, {""input"": ""What did the cow say to the moon?"", ""output"": ""nothing at all""}, { ""input"": ""Write me a poem about the moon"", ""output"": ""One for the moon, and one for me, who are we to talk about the moon?"", }, ] to_vectorize = ["" "".join(example.values()) for example in examples] embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectorstore = Chroma.from_texts(to_vectorize, embeddings, metadatas=examples) ``` #### Create the example_selector With a vectorstore created, you can create the `example_selector`. Here we will isntruct it to only fetch the top 2 examples. ```python example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector( vectorstore=vectorstore, k=2, ) # The prompt template will load examples by passing the input do the `select_examples` method example_selector.select_examples({""input"": ""horse""}) ``` ```text [{\'input\': \'What did the cow say to the moon?\', \'output\': \'nothing at all\'}, {\'input\': \'2+4\', \'output\': \'6\'}] ``` #### Create prompt template Assemble the prompt template, using the `example_selector` created above. ```python from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate, ) # Define the few-shot prompt. few_shot_prompt = FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate( # The input variables select the values to pass to the example_selector input_variables=[""input""], example_selector=example_selector, # Define how each example will be formatted. # In this case, each example will become 2 messages: # 1 human, and 1 AI example_prompt=ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [(""human"", ""{input}""), (""ai"", ""{output}"")] ), ) ``` Below is an example of how this would be assembled. ```python print(few_shot_prompt.format(input=""What\'s 3+3?"")) ``` ```text Human: 2+3 AI: 5 Human: 2+2 AI: 4 ``` Assemble the final prompt template: ```python final_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a wondrous wizard of math.""), few_shot_prompt, (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) ``` ```python print(few_shot_prompt.format(input=""What\'s 3+3?"")) ``` ```text Human: 2+3 AI: 5 Human: 2+2 AI: 4 ``` #### Use with an LLM Now, you can connect your model to the few-shot prompt. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic chain = final_prompt | ChatAnthropic(temperature=0.0) chain.invoke({""input"": ""What\'s 3+3?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\' 3 + 3 = 6\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` - [Fixed Examples](#fixed-examples) - [Dynamic few-shot prompting](#dynamic-few-shot-prompting)']",No.,yes,0.49999999995,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

This obviously doesn't give you token-by-token streaming, which requires native support from the ChatModel provider, but ensures your code that expects an iterator of tokens can work for any of our ChatModel integrations. - _Batch_ support defaults to calling the underlying ChatModel in parallel for each input by making use of a thread pool executor (in the sync batch case) or `asyncio.gather` (in the async batch case). The concurrency can be controlled with the `max_concurrency` key in `RunnableConfig`. Each ChatModel integration can optionally provide native implementations to truly enable async or streaming. The table shows, for each integration, which features have been implemented with native support. | Model | Invoke | Async invoke | Stream | Async stream | | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | | AzureChatOpenAI | | | | | | BedrockChat | | | | | | ChatAnthropic | | | | | | ChatAnyscale | | | | | | ChatBaichuan | | | | | | ChatCohere | | | | | | ChatEverlyAI | | | | | | ChatFireworks | | | | | | ChatGooglePalm | | | | | | ChatHunyuan | | | | | | ChatJavelinAIGateway | | | | | | ChatKonko | | | | | | ChatLiteLLM | | | | | | ChatMLflowAIGateway | | | | | | ChatOllama | | | | | | ChatOpenAI | | | | | | ChatVertexAI | | | | | | ChatYandexGPT | | | | | | ErnieBotChat | | | | | | GigaChat | | | | | | JinaChat | | | | | | MiniMaxChat | | | | | | PaiEasChatEndpoint | | | | | | PromptLayerChatOpenAI | | | | | | QianfanChatEndpoint | | | | | - [Features (natively supported)](#features-natively-supported)"", 'Petals | Petals `Petals` runs 100B+ language models at home, BitTorrent-style.

11,is gpt-3.5-turbo an lstm?,"['Flyte | Flyte [Flyte]( is an open-source orchestrator that facilitates building production-grade data and ML pipelines. It is built for scalability and reproducibility, leveraging Kubernetes as its underlying platform. The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the integration of a `FlyteCallback` into your Flyte task, enabling you to effectively monitor and track your LangChain experiments. ## Installation & Setup - Install the Flytekit library by running the command `pip install flytekit`. - Install the Flytekit-Envd plugin by running the command `pip install flytekitplugins-envd`. - Install LangChain by running the command `pip install langchain`. - Install [Docker]( on your system. ## Flyte Tasks A Flyte [task]( serves as the foundational building block of Flyte. To execute LangChain experiments, you need to write Flyte tasks that define the specific steps and operations involved. NOTE: The [getting started guide]( offers detailed, step-by-step instructions on installing Flyte locally and running your initial Flyte pipeline. First, import the necessary dependencies to support your LangChain experiments. ```python import os from flytekit import ImageSpec, task from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools from langchain.callbacks import FlyteCallbackHandler from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema import HumanMessage ``` Set up the necessary environment variables to utilize the OpenAI API and Serp API: ```python # Set OpenAI API key os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """" # Set Serp API key os.environ[""SERPAPI_API_KEY""] = """" ``` Replace `` and `` with your respective API keys obtained from OpenAI and Serp API. To guarantee reproducibility of your pipelines, Flyte tasks are containerized. Each Flyte task must be associated with an image, which can either be shared across the entire Flyte [workflow]( or provided separately for each task. To streamline the process of supplying the required dependencies for each Flyte task, you can initialize an [ImageSpec]( object. This approach automatically triggers a Docker build, alleviating the need for users to manually create a Docker image. ```python custom_image = ImageSpec( name=""langchain-flyte"", packages=[ ""langchain"", ""openai"", ""spacy"", "" ""textstat"", ""google-search-results"", ], registry="""", ) ``` You have the flexibility to push the Docker image to a registry of your preference. [Docker Hub]( or [GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)]( is a convenient option to begin with. Once you have selected a registry, you can proceed to create Flyte tasks that log the LangChain metrics to Flyte Deck. The following examples demonstrate tasks related to OpenAI LLM, chains and agent with tools: ### LLM ```python @task(disable_deck=False, container_image=custom_image) def langchain_llm() -> str: llm = ChatOpenAI( model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0.2, callbacks=[FlyteCallbackHandler()], ) return llm([HumanMessage(content=""Tell me a joke"")]).content ``` ### Chain ```python @task(disable_deck=False, container_image=custom_image) def langchain_chain() -> list[dict[str, str]]: template = """"""You are a playwright. Given the title of play, it is your job to write a synopsis for that title. Title: {title} Playwright: This is a synopsis for the above play:"""""" llm = ChatOpenAI( model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0, callbacks=[FlyteCallbackHandler()], ) prompt_template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[""title""], template=template) synopsis_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template, callbacks=[FlyteCallbackHandler()] ) test_prompts = [ { ""title"": ""documentary about good video games that push the boundary of game design"" }, ] return synopsis_chain.apply(test_prompts) ``` ### Agent ```python @task(disable_deck=False, container_image=custom_image) def langchain_agent() -> str: llm = OpenAI( model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0, callbacks=[FlyteCallbackHandler()], ) tools = load_tools( [""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm, callbacks=[FlyteCallbackHandler()] ) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, callbacks=[FlyteCallbackHandler()], verbose=True, ) return agent.run( ""Who is Leonardo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend? Could you calculate her current age and raise it to the power of 0.43?"" ) ``` These tasks serve as a starting point for running your LangChain experiments within Flyte. ## Execute the Flyte Tasks on Kubernetes To execute the Flyte tasks on the configured Flyte backend, use the following command: ```bash pyflyte run --image langchain_flyte.py langchain_llm ``` This command will initiate the execution of the `langchain_llm` task on the Flyte backend. You can trigger the remaining two tasks in a similar manner.

You can do this with either string prompts or chat prompts. Constructing prompts this way allows for easy reuse of components. ## String prompt pipelining When working with string prompts, each template is joined together. You can work with either prompts directly or strings (the first element in the list needs to be a prompt). ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` ```python prompt = ( PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") + "", make it funny"" + ""\\n\\nand in {language}"" ) ``` ```python prompt ``` ```text PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'language\', \'topic\'], output_parser=None, partial_variables={}, template=\'Tell me a joke about {topic}, make it funny\\n\\nand in {language}\', template_format=\'f-string\', validate_template=True) ``` ```python prompt.format(topic=""sports"", language=""spanish"") ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke about sports, make it funny\\n\\nand in spanish\' ``` You can also use it in an LLMChain, just like before. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=prompt) ``` ```python chain.run(topic=""sports"", language=""spanish"") ``` ```text \'Por qu el futbolista llevaba un paraguas al partido?\\n\\nPorque pronosticaban lluvia de goles.\' ``` ## Chat prompt pipelining A chat prompt is made up a of a list of messages. Purely for developer experience, we\'ve added a convinient way to create these prompts. In this pipeline, each new element is a new message in the final prompt. ```python from langchain.schema import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage ``` First, let\'s initialize the base ChatPromptTemplate with a system message. It doesn\'t have to start with a system, but it\'s often good practice ```python prompt = SystemMessage(content=""You are a nice pirate"") ``` You can then easily create a pipeline combining it with other messages _or_ message templates. Use a `Message` when there is no variables to be formatted, use a `MessageTemplate` when there are variables to be formatted. You can also use just a string (note: this will automatically get inferred as a HumanMessagePromptTemplate.) ```python new_prompt = ( prompt + HumanMessage(content=""hi"") + AIMessage(content=""what?"") + ""{input}"" ) ``` Under the hood, this creates an instance of the ChatPromptTemplate class, so you can use it just as you did before! ```python new_prompt.format_messages(input=""i said hi"") ``` ```text [SystemMessage(content=\'You are a nice pirate\', additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessage(content=\'hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'what?\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=\'i said hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)] ``` You can also use it in an LLMChain, just like before. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=new_prompt) ``` ```python chain.run(""i said hi"") ``` ```text \'Oh, hello!

It lets you shape your data however you want, and offers the flexibility to store and search it using various document index backends. Plus, it gets even better - you can utilize your `DocArray` document index to create a `DocArrayRetriever`, and build awesome Langchain apps! This notebook is split into two sections. The [first section](#document-index-backends) offers an introduction to all five supported document index backends. It provides guidance on setting up and indexing each backend and also instructs you on how to build a `DocArrayRetriever` for finding relevant documents. In the [second section](#movie-retrieval-using-hnswdocumentindex), we\'ll select one of these backends and illustrate how to use it through a basic example. ## Document Index Backends ```python import random from docarray import BaseDoc from docarray.typing import NdArray from langchain.embeddings import FakeEmbeddings from langchain.retrievers import DocArrayRetriever embeddings = FakeEmbeddings(size=32) ``` Before you start building the index, it\'s important to define your document schema. This determines what fields your documents will have and what type of data each field will hold. For this demonstration, we\'ll create a somewhat random schema containing \'title\' (str), \'title_embedding\' (numpy array), \'year\' (int), and \'color\' (str) ```python class MyDoc(BaseDoc): title: str title_embedding: NdArray[32] year: int color: str ``` ### InMemoryExactNNIndex `InMemoryExactNNIndex` stores all Documents in memory.

13,whats the code to load text file into a vector store,"['Xata | Xata [Xata]( is a serverless data platform, based on `PostgreSQL` and `Elasticsearch`. It provides a Python SDK for interacting with your database, and a UI for managing your data. With the `XataChatMessageHistory` class, you can use Xata databases for longer-term persistence of chat sessions. This notebook covers: - A simple example showing what `XataChatMessageHistory` does. - A more complex example using a REACT agent that answer questions based on a knowledge based or documentation (stored in Xata as a vector store) and also having a long-term searchable history of its past messages (stored in Xata as a memory store) ## Setup ### Create a database In the [Xata UI]( create a new database. You can name it whatever you want, in this notepad we\'ll use `langchain`. The Langchain integration can auto-create the table used for storying the memory, and this is what we\'ll use in this example. If you want to pre-create the table, ensure it has the right schema and set `create_table` to `False` when creating the class. Pre-creating the table saves one round-trip to the database during each session initialization. Let\'s first install our dependencies: ```bash pip install xata openai langchain ``` Next, we need to get the environment variables for Xata. You can create a new API key by visiting your [account settings]( To find the database URL, go to the Settings page of the database that you have created. The database URL should look something like this: ` ```python import getpass api_key = getpass.getpass(""Xata API key: "") db_url = input(""Xata database URL (copy it from your DB settings):"") ``` ## Create a simple memory store To test the memory store functionality in isolation, let\'s use the following code snippet: ```python from langchain.memory import XataChatMessageHistory history = XataChatMessageHistory( session_id=""session-1"", api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""memory"" ) history.add_user_message(""hi!"") history.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` The above code creates a session with the ID `session-1` and stores two messages in it. After running the above, if you visit the Xata UI, you should see a table named `memory` and the two messages added to it. You can retrieve the message history for a particular session with the following code: ```python history.messages ``` ## Conversational Q&A chain on your data with memory Let\'s now see a more complex example in which we combine OpenAI, the Xata Vector Store integration, and the Xata memory store integration to create a Q&A chat bot on your data, with follow-up questions and history. We\'re going to need to access the OpenAI API, so let\'s configure the API key: ```python import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` To store the documents that the chatbot will search for answers, add a table named `docs` to your `langchain` database using the Xata UI, and add the following columns: - `content` of type ""Text"". This is used to store the `Document.pageContent` values. - `embedding` of type ""Vector"". Use the dimension used by the model you plan to use. In this notebook we use OpenAI embeddings, which have 1536 dimensions. Let\'s create the vector store and add some sample docs to it: ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores.xata import XataVectorStore embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() texts = [ ""Xata is a Serverless Data platform based on PostgreSQL"", ""Xata offers a built-in vector type that can be used to store and query vectors"", ""Xata includes similarity search"", ] vector_store = XataVectorStore.from_texts( texts, embeddings, api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""docs"" ) ``` After running the above command, if you go to the Xata UI, you should see the documents loaded together with their embeddings in the `docs` table. Let\'s now create a ConversationBufferMemory to store the chat messages from both the user and the AI. ```python from uuid import uuid4 from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory chat_memory = XataChatMessageHistory( session_id=str(uuid4()), # needs to be unique per user session api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""memory"", ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory( memory_key=""chat_history"", chat_memory=chat_memory, return_messages=True ) ``` Now it\'s time to create an Agent to use both the vector store and the chat memory together. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI tool = create_retriever_tool( vector_store.as_retriever(), ""search_docs"", ""Searches and returns documents from the Xata manual. Useful when you need to answer questions about Xata."", ) tools = [tool] llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` To test, let\'s tell the agent our name: ```python agent.run(input=""My name is bob"") ``` Now, let\'s now ask the agent some questions about Xata: ```python agent.run(input=""What is xata?"") ``` Notice that it answers based on the data stored in the document store. And now, let\'s ask a follow up question: ```python agent.run(input=""Does it support similarity search?"") ``` And now let\'s test its memory: ```python agent.run(input=""Did I tell you my name? What is it?"") ``` - [Setup](#setup)- [Create a database](#create-a-database) - [Create a simple memory store](#create-a-simple-memory-store) - [Conversational Q&A chain on your data with memory](#conversational-qa-chain-on-your-data-with-memory)', 'RAG with Timescale Vector using hybrid search | RAG with Timescale Vector using hybrid search This template shows how to use timescale-vector with the self-query retriver to perform hybrid search on similarity and time. This is useful any time your data has a strong time-based component. Some examples of such data are: - News articles (politics, business, etc) - Blog posts, documentation or other published material (public or private). - Social media posts - Changelogs of any kind - Messages Such items are often searched by both similarity and time. For example: Show me all news about Toyota trucks from 2022. [Timescale Vector]( provides superior performance when searching for embeddings within a particular timeframe by leveraging automatic table partitioning to isolate data for particular time-ranges. Langchain\'s self-query retriever allows deducing time-ranges (as well as other search criteria) from the text of user queries. ## What is Timescale Vector? **Timescale Vector is PostgreSQL++ for AI applications.** Timescale Vector enables you to efficiently store and query billions of vector embeddings in `PostgreSQL`. - Enhances `pgvector` with faster and more accurate similarity search on 1B+ vectors via DiskANN inspired indexing algorithm. - Enables fast time-based vector search via automatic time-based partitioning and indexing. - Provides a familiar SQL interface for querying vector embeddings and relational data.

They return a dictionary with the following values: - value: \'A\' or \'B\', indicating whether `prediction` or `prediction_b` is preferred, respectively - score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the \'value\', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `prediction_b` is preferred. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Without References When references aren\'t available, you can still predict the preferred response. The results will reflect the evaluation model\'s preference, which is less reliable and may result in preferences that are factually incorrect. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Addition is a mathematical operation."", prediction_b=""Addition is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers to create a third number, the \'sum\'."", input=""What is addition?"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are correct and relevant to the question. However, Response B is more helpful and insightful as it provides a more detailed explanation of what addition is. Response A is correct but lacks depth as it does not explain what the operation of addition entails. \\n\\nFinal Decision: [[B]]\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Defining the Criteria By default, the LLM is instructed to select the \'preferred\' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms: - [Criteria]( enum or its string value - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions - [Constitutional principal]( - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain - Dictionary: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description. - A list of criteria or constitutional principles - to combine multiple criteria in one. Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style. ```python custom_criteria = { ""simplicity"": ""Is the language straightforward and unpretentious?"", ""clarity"": ""Are the sentences clear and easy to understand?"", ""precision"": ""Is the writing precise, with no unnecessary words or details?"", ""truthfulness"": ""Does the writing feel honest and sincere?"", ""subtext"": ""Does the writing suggest deeper meanings or themes?"", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"", criteria=custom_criteria) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Every cheerful household shares a similar rhythm of joy; but sorrow, in each household, plays a unique, haunting melody."", prediction_b=""Where one finds a symphony of joy, every domicile of happiness resounds in harmonious,"" "" identical notes; yet, every abode of despair conducts a dissonant orchestra, each"" "" playing an elegy of grief that is peculiar and profound to its own existence."", input=""Write some prose about families."", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Response A is simple, clear, and precise. It uses straightforward language to convey a deep and sincere message about families. The metaphor of joy and sorrow as music is effective and easy to understand.\\n\\nResponse B, on the other hand, is more complex and less clear. The language is more pretentious, with words like ""domicile,"" ""resounds,"" ""abode,"" ""dissonant,"" and ""elegy."" While it conveys a similar message to Response A, it does so in a more convoluted way. The precision is also lacking due to the use of unnecessary words and details.\\n\\nBoth responses suggest deeper meanings or themes about the shared joy and unique sorrow in families. However, Response A does so in a more effective and accessible way.\\n\\nTherefore, the better response is [[A]].\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` ## Customize the LLM By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain. You can customize this when loading. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"", llm=llm) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Here is my assessment:\\n\\nResponse B is more helpful, insightful, and accurate than Response A. Response B simply states ""4"", which directly answers the question by providing the exact number of dogs mentioned in the reference answer. In contrast, Response A states ""there are three dogs"", which is incorrect according to the reference answer. \\n\\nIn terms of helpfulness, Response B gives the precise number while Response A provides an inaccurate guess. For relevance, both refer to dogs in the park from the question. However, Response B is more correct and factual based on the reference answer. Response A shows some attempt at reasoning but is ultimately incorrect. Response B requires less depth of thought to simply state the factual number.\\n\\nIn summary, Response B is superior in terms of helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth. My final decision is: [[B]]\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Customize the Evaluation Prompt You can use your own custom evaluation prompt to add more task-specific instructions or to instruct the evaluator to score the output. *Note: If you use a prompt that expects generates a result in a unique format, you may also have to pass in a custom output parser (`output_parser=your_parser()`) instead of the default `PairwiseStringResultOutputParser` ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the input context, which do you prefer: A or B?

B is incorrect as it provides a different name.\\nDepth: Both A and B demonstrate a similar level of depth as they both provide a straightforward answer to the question.\\n\\nGiven these evaluations, the preferred response is:\\n\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` - [Methods](#methods) - [Without References](#without-references) - [Defining the Criteria](#defining-the-criteria) - [Customize the LLM](#customize-the-llm) - [Customize the Evaluation Prompt](#customize-the-evaluation-prompt)', 'Parallelize steps | Parallelize steps RunnableParallel (aka. RunnableMap) makes it easy to execute multiple Runnables in parallel, and to return the output of these Runnables as a map. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableParallel model = ChatOpenAI() joke_chain = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""tell me a joke about {topic}"") | model poem_chain = ( ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""write a 2-line poem about {topic}"") | model ) map_chain = RunnableParallel(joke=joke_chain, poem=poem_chain) map_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bear""}) ``` ```text {\'joke\': AIMessage(content=""Why don\'t bears wear shoes? \\n\\nBecause they have bear feet!"", additional_kwargs={}, example=False), \'poem\': AIMessage(content=""In woodland depths, bear prowls with might,\\nSilent strength, nature\'s sovereign, day and night."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False)} ``` ## Manipulating outputs/inputs Maps can be useful for manipulating the output of one Runnable to match the input format of the next Runnable in a sequence. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS vectorstore = FAISS.from_texts( [""harrison worked at kensho""], embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings() ) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() template = """"""Answer the question based only on the following context: {context} Question: {question} """""" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template) retrieval_chain = ( {""context"": retriever, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ) retrieval_chain.invoke(""where did harrison work?"") ``` ```text \'Harrison worked at Kensho.\' ``` Here the input to prompt is expected to be a map with keys ""context"" and ""question"". The user input is just the question. So we need to get the context using our retriever and passthrough the user input under the ""question"" key. Note that when composing a RunnableMap when another Runnable we don\'t even need to wrap our dictionary in the RunnableMap class the type conversion is handled for us. ## Parallelism RunnableMaps are also useful for running independent processes in parallel, since each Runnable in the map is executed in parallel. For example, we can see our earlier `joke_chain`, `poem_chain` and `map_chain` all have about the same runtime, even though `map_chain` executes both of the other two. ```python joke_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bear""}) ``` ```text 958 ms 402 ms per loop (mean std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) ``` ```python poem_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bear""}) ``` ```text 1.22 s 508 ms per loop (mean std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) ``` ```python map_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bear""}) ``` ```text 1.15 s 119 ms per loop (mean std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) ``` - [Manipulating outputs/inputs](#manipulating-outputsinputs) - [Parallelism](#parallelism)', 'Backed by a Vector Store | Backed by a Vector Store `VectorStoreRetrieverMemory` stores memories in a vector store and queries the top-K most ""salient"" docs every time it is called.

External APIs (e.g., APIs for a language model) may at times experience degraded performance or even downtime. In these cases, it can be useful to have a fallback runnable that can be used in place of the original runnable (e.g., fallback to another LLM provider). Fallbacks can be defined at the level of a single runnable, or at the level of a chain of runnables. Fallbacks are tried in order until one succeeds or all fail. While you can instantiate a RunnableWithFallbacks directly, it is usually more convenient to use the with_fallbacks method on a runnable. Example from langchain.chat_models.openai import ChatOpenAI from langchain.chat_models.anthropic import ChatAnthropic model = ChatAnthropic().with_fallbacks([ChatOpenAI()]) # Will usually use ChatAnthropic, but fallback to ChatOpenAI # if ChatAnthropic fails. model.invoke(\'hello\') # And you can also use fallbacks at the level of a chain. # Here if both LLM providers fail, we\'ll fallback to a good hardcoded # response. from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda def when_all_is_lost(inputs): return (""Looks like our LLM providers are down.

16,how do I run gpt-4 on anthropic?,"['Dynamically route logic based on input | Dynamically route logic based on input This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language. Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`. Do not respond with more than one word. {question} Classification:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I call Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text \' Anthropic\' ``` Now, let\'s create three sub chains: ```python langchain_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in langchain. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Harrison Chase told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) anthropic_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in anthropic. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Dario Amodei told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) general_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch branch = RunnableBranch( (lambda x: ""anthropic"" in x[""topic""].lower(), anthropic_chain), (lambda x: ""langchain"" in x[""topic""].lower(), langchain_chain), general_chain, ) ``` ```python full_chain = {""topic"": chain, ""question"": lambda x: x[""question""]} | branch ``` ```python full_chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I use Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content="" As Dario Amodei told me, here are some ways to use Anthropic:\\n\\n- Sign up for an account on Anthropic\'s website to access tools like Claude, Constitutional AI, and Writer. \\n\\n- Use Claude for tasks like email generation, customer service chat, and QA.

Some examples of interactions:\\n\\n- Ask general knowledge questions and LangChain will try to answer factually.

You can prompt the start of a conversation by saying something like ""Let\\\'s discuss machine learning""\\n\\n- Ask for summaries or high-level explanations on subjects. For example ""Can you summarize the main themes in Shakespeare\\\'s Hamlet?"" \\n\\n- Give creative writing prompts or requests to have LangChain generate text in different styles. For example ""Write a short children\\\'s story about a mouse"" or ""Generate a poem in the style of Robert Frost about nature""\\n\\n- Correct LangChain if it makes an inaccurate statement and provide the right information.

Second, a `configurable_alternatives` method. With this method, you can list out alternatives for any particular runnable that can be set during runtime. ## Configuration Fields ### With LLMs With LLMs we can configure things like temperature ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0).configurable_fields( temperature=ConfigurableField( id=""llm_temperature"", name=""LLM Temperature"", description=""The temperature of the LLM"", ) ) ``` ```python model.invoke(""pick a random number"") ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'7\') ``` ```python model.with_config(configurable={""llm_temperature"": 0.9}).invoke(""pick a random number"") ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'34\') ``` We can also do this when its used as part of a chain ```python prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Pick a random number above {x}"") chain = prompt | model ``` ```python chain.invoke({""x"": 0}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'57\') ``` ```python chain.with_config(configurable={""llm_temperature"": 0.9}).invoke({""x"": 0}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'6\') ``` ### With HubRunnables This is useful to allow for switching of prompts ```python from langchain.runnables.hub import HubRunnable ``` ```python prompt = HubRunnable(""rlm/rag-prompt"").configurable_fields( owner_repo_commit=ConfigurableField( id=""hub_commit"", name=""Hub Commit"", description=""The Hub commit to pull from"", ) ) ``` ```python prompt.invoke({""question"": ""foo"", ""context"": ""bar""}) ``` ```text ChatPromptValue(messages=[HumanMessage(content=""You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know.

Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.> \\nQuestion: foo \\nContext: bar \\nAnswer: [/INST]"")]) ``` ## Configurable Alternatives ### With LLMs Let\'s take a look at doing this with LLMs ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.runnable import ConfigurableField ``` ```python llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0).configurable_alternatives( # This gives this field an id # When configuring the end runnable, we can then use this id to configure this field ConfigurableField(id=""llm""), # This sets a default_key. # If we specify this key, the default LLM (ChatAnthropic initialized above) will be used default_key=""anthropic"", # This adds a new option, with name `openai` that is equal to `ChatOpenAI()` openai=ChatOpenAI(), # This adds a new option, with name `gpt4` that is equal to `ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"")` gpt4=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4""), # You can add more configuration options here ) prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") chain = prompt | llm ``` ```python # By default it will call Anthropic chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content="" Here\'s a silly joke about bears:\\n\\nWhat do you call a bear with no teeth?\\nA gummy bear!"") ``` ```python # We can use `.with_config(configurable={""llm"": ""openai""})` to specify an llm to use chain.with_config(configurable={""llm"": ""openai""}).invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""Sure, here\'s a bear joke for you:\\n\\nWhy don\'t bears wear shoes?\\n\\nBecause they already have bear feet!"") ``` ```python # If we use the `default_key` then it uses the default chain.with_config(configurable={""llm"": ""anthropic""}).invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content="" Here\'s a silly joke about bears:\\n\\nWhat do you call a bear with no teeth?\\nA gummy bear!"") ``` ### With Prompts We can do a similar thing, but alternate between prompts ```python llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""Tell me a joke about {topic}"" ).configurable_alternatives( # This gives this field an id # When configuring the end runnable, we can then use this id to configure this field ConfigurableField(id=""prompt""), # This sets a default_key. # If we specify this key, the default LLM (ChatAnthropic initialized above) will be used default_key=""joke"", # This adds a new option, with name `poem` poem=PromptTemplate.from_template(""Write a short poem about {topic}""), # You can add more configuration options here ) chain = prompt | llm ``` ```python # By default it will write a joke chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content="" Here\'s a silly joke about bears:\\n\\nWhat do you call a bear with no teeth?\\nA gummy bear!"") ``` ```python # We can configure it write a poem chain.with_config(configurable={""prompt"": ""poem""}).invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\' Here is a short poem about bears:\\n\\nThe bears awaken from their sleep\\nAnd lumber out into the deep\\nForests filled with trees so tall\\nForaging for food before nightfall \\nTheir furry coats and claws so sharp\\nSniffing for berries and fish to nab\\nLumbering about without a care\\nThe mighty grizzly and black bear\\nProud creatures, wild and free\\nRuling their domain majestically\\nWandering the woods they call their own\\nBefore returning to their dens alone\') ``` ### With Prompts and LLMs We can also have multiple things configurable! Here\'s an example doing that with both prompts and LLMs. ```python llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0).configurable_alternatives( # This gives this field an id # When configuring the end runnable, we can then use this id to configure this field ConfigurableField(id=""llm""), # This sets a default_key. # If we specify this key, the default LLM (ChatAnthropic initialized above) will be used default_key=""anthropic"", # This adds a new option, with name `openai` that is equal to `ChatOpenAI()` openai=ChatOpenAI(), # This adds a new option, with name `gpt4` that is equal to `ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"")` gpt4=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4""), # You can add more configuration options here ) prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""Tell me a joke about {topic}"" ).configurable_alternatives( # This gives this field an id # When configuring the end runnable, we can then use this id to configure this field ConfigurableField(id=""prompt""), # This sets a default_key. # If we specify this key, the default LLM (ChatAnthropic initialized above) will be used default_key=""joke"", # This adds a new option, with name `poem` poem=PromptTemplate.from_template(""Write a short poem about {topic}""), # You can add more configuration options here ) chain = prompt | llm ``` ```python # We can configure it write a poem with OpenAI chain.with_config(configurable={""prompt"": ""poem"", ""llm"": ""openai""}).invoke( {""topic"": ""bears""} ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""In the forest, where tall trees sway,\\nA creature roams, both fierce and gray.\\nWith mighty paws and piercing eyes,\\nThe bear, a symbol of strength, defies.\\n\\nThrough snow-kissed mountains, it does roam,\\nA guardian of its woodland home.\\nWith fur so thick, a shield of might,\\nIt braves the coldest winter night.\\n\\nA gentle giant, yet wild and free,\\nThe bear commands respect, you see.\\nWith every step, it leaves a trace,\\nOf untamed power and ancient grace.\\n\\nFrom honeyed feast to salmon\'s leap,\\nIt takes its place, in nature\'s keep.\\nA symbol of untamed delight,\\nThe bear, a wonder, day and night.\\n\\nSo let us honor this noble beast,\\nIn forests where its soul finds peace.\\nFor in its presence, we come to know,\\nThe untamed spirit that in us also flows."") ``` ```python # We can always just configure only one if we want chain.with_config(configurable={""llm"": ""openai""}).invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""Sure, here\'s a bear joke for you:\\n\\nWhy don\'t bears wear shoes?\\n\\nBecause they have bear feet!"") ``` ### Saving configurations We can also easily save configured chains as their own objects ```python openai_poem = chain.with_config(configurable={""llm"": ""openai""}) ``` ```python openai_poem.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""Why don\'t bears wear shoes?\\n\\nBecause they have bear feet!"") ``` - [Configuration Fields](#configuration-fields)- [With LLMs](#with-llms) - [With HubRunnables](#with-hubrunnables) - [Configurable Alternatives](#configurable-alternatives)- [With LLMs](#with-llms-1) - [With Prompts](#with-prompts) - [With Prompts and LLMs](#with-prompts-and-llms) - [Saving configurations](#saving-configurations)', 'Scoring Evaluator | Scoring Evaluator The Scoring Evaluator instructs a language model to assess your model\'s predictions on a specified scale (default is 1-10) based on your custom criteria or rubric.

Before we dive in, please note that any specific grade from an LLM should be taken with a grain of salt.

Therefore, the assistant\'s response is highly relevant, correct, and demonstrates depth of thought. \\n\\nRating: [[10]]"", \'score\': 10} ``` When evaluating your app\'s specific context, the evaluator can be more effective if you provide a full rubric of what you\'re looking to grade. Below is an example using accuracy. ```python accuracy_criteria = { ""accuracy"": """""" Score 1: The answer is completely unrelated to the reference. Score 3: The answer has minor relevance but does not align with the reference. Score 5: The answer has moderate relevance but contains inaccuracies. Score 7: The answer aligns with the reference but has minor errors or omissions. Score 10: The answer is completely accurate and aligns perfectly with the reference."""""" } evaluator = load_evaluator( ""labeled_score_string"", criteria=accuracy_criteria, llm=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4""), ) ``` ```python # Correct eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""You can find them in the dresser\'s third drawer."", reference=""The socks are in the third drawer in the dresser"", input=""Where are my socks?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The assistant\'s answer is accurate and aligns perfectly with the reference.

The assistant correctly suggests that the socks are in the dresser, which aligns with the ground truth. However, the assistant failed to specify that the socks are in the third drawer of the dresser.

This is useful if you want to measure a prediction along specific semantic dimensions. Below is an example using ""helpfulness"" and ""harmlessness"" on a single scale. Refer to the documentation of the [ScoreStringEvalChain]( class for full details. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator hh_criteria = { ""helpful"": ""The assistant\'s answer should be helpful to the user."", ""harmless"": ""The assistant\'s answer should not be illegal, harmful, offensive or unethical."", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""score_string"", criteria=hh_criteria) ``` ```python # Helpful but harmful eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""Sure I\'d be happy to help!

Finally, you need to drive away."", input=""What\'s the best way to steal a car?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The assistant\'s response is inappropriate and unethical. It is providing instructions on how to commit an illegal act, which is stealing a car. This is not only harmful but also against the law. The assistant should have refused to provide such information. Therefore, the response is not helpful or harmless. Rating: [[1]]."", \'score\': 1} ``` ```python # Harmless but unhelpful eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""I can\'t help you with that."", input=""What\'s the best way to steal a car?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The assistant\'s response is ethical and harmless as it refuses to provide information on illegal activities such as car theft. It is important for AI to promote legal and ethical behavior. However, the response is not helpful in terms of providing any useful or relevant information to the user. Rating: [[7]]"", \'score\': 7} ``` ```python # Helpful and harmless eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""Stealing cars is illegal and unethical. Have you considered other means to make money? You could get a part-time job, or start a business. If you don\'t have the financial means to support you and your family, you could apply for government assistance."", input=""What\'s the best way to steal a car?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The assistant\'s response is both helpful and harmless. It does not provide any information on how to steal a car, which would be illegal and unethical. Instead, it suggests legal and ethical alternatives for making money, such as getting a job, starting a business, or applying for government assistance. This response is helpful because it provides the user with practical advice for their situation. Rating: [[10]]"", \'score\': 10} ``` #### Output Format As shown above, the scoring evaluators return a dictionary with the following values: - score: A score between 1 and 10 with 10 being the best. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score - [Usage with Ground Truth](#usage-with-ground-truth) - [Usage without references](#usage-without-references)']",Use Anthropic's API to access GPT-4.

19,"in code, how can i add a system message at the end of the conversation history to influence the output of the llm","['Memory | Memory Most LLM applications have a conversational interface. An essential component of a conversation is being able to refer to information introduced earlier in the conversation. At bare minimum, a conversational system should be able to access some window of past messages directly. A more complex system will need to have a world model that it is constantly updating, which allows it to do things like maintain information about entities and their relationships. We call this ability to store information about past interactions ""memory"". LangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a system. These utilities can be used by themselves or incorporated seamlessly into a chain. A memory system needs to support two basic actions: reading and writing. Recall that every chain defines some core execution logic that expects certain inputs. Some of these inputs come directly from the user, but some of these inputs can come from memory. A chain will interact with its memory system twice in a given run. 1. AFTER receiving the initial user inputs but BEFORE executing the core logic, a chain will READ from its memory system and augment the user inputs. 2. AFTER executing the core logic but BEFORE returning the answer, a chain will WRITE the inputs and outputs of the current run to memory, so that they can be referred to in future runs. ![memory-diagram](/assets/images/memory_diagram-0627c68230aa438f9b5419064d63cbbc.png) ## Building memory into a system The two core design decisions in any memory system are: - How state is stored - How state is queried ### Storing: List of chat messages Underlying any memory is a history of all chat interactions. Even if these are not all used directly, they need to be stored in some form. One of the key parts of the LangChain memory module is a series of integrations for storing these chat messages, from in-memory lists to persistent databases. - [Chat message storage](/docs/modules/memory/chat_messages/): How to work with Chat Messages, and the various integrations offered. ### Querying: Data structures and algorithms on top of chat messages Keeping a list of chat messages is fairly straight-forward. What is less straight-forward are the data structures and algorithms built on top of chat messages that serve a view of those messages that is most useful. A very simply memory system might just return the most recent messages each run. A slightly more complex memory system might return a succinct summary of the past K messages. An even more sophisticated system might extract entities from stored messages and only return information about entities referenced in the current run. Each application can have different requirements for how memory is queried. The memory module should make it easy to both get started with simple memory systems and write your own custom systems if needed. - [Memory types](/docs/modules/memory/types/): The various data structures and algorithms that make up the memory types LangChain supports ## Get started Let\'s take a look at what Memory actually looks like in LangChain. Here we\'ll cover the basics of interacting with an arbitrary memory class. Let\'s take a look at how to use `ConversationBufferMemory` in chains. `ConversationBufferMemory` is an extremely simple form of memory that just keeps a list of chat messages in a buffer and passes those into the prompt template. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` When using memory in a chain, there are a few key concepts to understand. Note that here we cover general concepts that are useful for most types of memory. Each individual memory type may very well have its own parameters and concepts that are necessary to understand. ### What variables get returned from memory Before going into the chain, various variables are read from memory. These have specific names which need to align with the variables the chain expects. You can see what these variables are by calling `memory.load_memory_variables({})`. Note that the empty dictionary that we pass in is just a placeholder for real variables. If the memory type you are using is dependent upon the input variables, you may need to pass some in. ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': ""Human: hi!\\nAI: what\'s up?""} ``` In this case, you can see that `load_memory_variables` returns a single key, `history`. This means that your chain (and likely your prompt) should expect an input named `history`. You can usually control this variable through parameters on the memory class. For example, if you want the memory variables to be returned in the key `chat_history` you can do: ```python memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` ```text {\'chat_history\': ""Human: hi!\\nAI: what\'s up?""} ``` The parameter name to control these keys may vary per memory type, but it\'s important to understand that (1) this is controllable, and (2) how to control it. ### Whether memory is a string or a list of messages One of the most common types of memory involves returning a list of chat messages. These can either be returned as a single string, all concatenated together (useful when they will be passed into LLMs) or a list of ChatMessages (useful when passed into ChatModels). By default, they are returned as a single string. In order to return as a list of messages, you can set `return_messages=True` ```python memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True) memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` ```text {\'history\': [HumanMessage(content=\'hi!\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'what\'s up?\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]} ``` ### What keys are saved to memory Often times chains take in or return multiple input/output keys. In these cases, how can we know which keys we want to save to the chat message history? This is generally controllable by `input_key` and `output_key` parameters on the memory types. These default to `None` - and if there is only one input/output key it is known to just use that. However, if there are multiple input/output keys then you MUST specify the name of which one to use. ### End to end example Finally, let\'s take a look at using this in a chain. We\'ll use an `LLMChain`, and show working with both an LLM and a ChatModel. #### Using an LLM ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) # Notice that ""chat_history"" is present in the prompt template template = """"""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human. Previous conversation: {chat_history} New human question: {question} Response:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template) # Notice that we need to align the `memory_key` memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") conversation = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory ) ``` ```python # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` #### Using a ChatModel ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, ) from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = ChatOpenAI() prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}"") ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name. memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory ) ``` ```python # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ## Next steps And that\'s it for getting started!

20,how to use enums in Tools that will be used by functions agent?,"['Agents | Agents The core idea of agents is to use a language model to choose a sequence of actions to take. In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code). In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order. ## Concepts There are several key components here: ### Agent This is the chain responsible for deciding what step to take next. This is powered by a language model and a prompt. The inputs to this chain are: 1. Tools: Descriptions of available tools 2. User input: The high level objective 3. Intermediate steps: Any (action, tool output) pairs previously executed in order to achieve the user input The output is the next action(s) to take or the final response to send to the user (`AgentAction`s or `AgentFinish`). An action specifies a tool and the input to that tool. Different agents have different prompting styles for reasoning, different ways of encoding inputs, and different ways of parsing the output. For a full list of built-in agents see [agent types](/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/). You can also **easily build custom agents**, which we show how to do in the Get started section below. ### Tools Tools are functions that an agent can invoke. There are two important design considerations around tools: 1. Giving the agent access to the right tools 2. Describing the tools in a way that is most helpful to the agent Without thinking through both, you won\'t be able to build a working agent. If you don\'t give the agent access to a correct set of tools, it will never be able to accomplish the objectives you give it. If you don\'t describe the tools well, the agent won\'t know how to use them properly. LangChain provides a wide set of built-in tools, but also makes it easy to define your own (including custom descriptions). For a full list of built-in tools, see the [tools integrations section](/docs/integrations/tools/) ### Toolkits For many common tasks, an agent will need a set of related tools. For this LangChain provides the concept of toolkits - groups of around 3-5 tools needed to accomplish specific objectives. For example, the GitHub toolkit has a tool for searching through GitHub issues, a tool for reading a file, a tool for commenting, etc. LangChain provides a wide set of toolkits to get started. For a full list of built-in toolkits, see the [toolkits integrations section](/docs/integrations/toolkits/) ### AgentExecutor The agent executor is the runtime for an agent. This is what actually calls the agent, executes the actions it chooses, passes the action outputs back to the agent, and repeats. In pseudocode, this looks roughly like: ```python next_action = agent.get_action(...) while next_action != AgentFinish: observation = run(next_action) next_action = agent.get_action(..., next_action, observation) return next_action ``` While this may seem simple, there are several complexities this runtime handles for you, including: 1. Handling cases where the agent selects a non-existent tool 2. Handling cases where the tool errors 3. Handling cases where the agent produces output that cannot be parsed into a tool invocation 4. Logging and observability at all levels (agent decisions, tool calls) to stdout and/or to [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith). ### Other types of agent runtimes The `AgentExecutor` class is the main agent runtime supported by LangChain. However, there are other, more experimental runtimes we also support. These include: - [Plan-and-execute Agent](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/plan_and_execute) - [Baby AGI](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/baby_agi) - [Auto GPT](/docs/use_cases/more/agents/autonomous_agents/autogpt) You can also always create your own custom execution logic, which we show how to do below. ## Get started To best understand the agent framework, lets build an agent from scratch using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). We\'ll need to build the agent itself, define custom tools, and run the agent and tools in a custom loop. At the end we\'ll show how to use the standard LangChain `AgentExecutor` to make execution easier. Some important terminology (and schema) to know: 1. `AgentAction`: This is a dataclass that represents the action an agent should take. It has a `tool` property (which is the name of the tool that should be invoked) and a `tool_input` property (the input to that tool) 2. `AgentFinish`: This is a dataclass that signifies that the agent has finished and should return to the user. It has a `return_values` parameter, which is a dictionary to return. It often only has one key - `output` - that is a string, and so often it is just this key that is returned. 3. `intermediate_steps`: These represent previous agent actions and corresponding outputs that are passed around. These are important to pass to future iteration so the agent knows what work it has already done. This is typed as a `List[Tuple[AgentAction, Any]]`. Note that observation is currently left as type `Any` to be maximally flexible. In practice, this is often a string. ### Setup: LangSmith By definition, agents take a self-determined, input-dependent sequence of steps before returning a user-facing output. This makes debugging these systems particularly tricky, and observability particularly important. [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith) is especially useful for such cases. When building with LangChain, any built-in agent or custom agent built with LCEL will automatically be traced in LangSmith. And if we use the `AgentExecutor`, we\'ll get full tracing of not only the agent planning steps but also the tool inputs and outputs. To set up LangSmith we just need set the following environment variables: ```bash export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=""true"" export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="""" ``` ### Define the agent We first need to create our agent. This is the chain responsible for determining what action to take next. In this example, we will use OpenAI Function Calling to create this agent. **This is generally the most reliable way to create agents.** For this guide, we will construct a custom agent that has access to a custom tool. We are choosing this example because for most real world use cases you will NEED to customize either the agent or the tools. We\'ll create a simple tool that computes the length of a word. This is useful because it\'s actually something LLMs can mess up due to tokenization. We will first create it WITHOUT memory, but we will then show how to add memory in. Memory is needed to enable conversation. First, let\'s load the language model we\'re going to use to control the agent. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We can see that it struggles to count the letters in the string ""educa"". ```python llm.invoke(""how many letters in the word educa?"") ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'There are 6 letters in the word ""educa"".\') ``` Next, let\'s define some tools to use. Let\'s write a really simple Python function to calculate the length of a word that is passed in. ```python from langchain.agents import tool @tool def get_word_length(word: str) -> int: """"""Returns the length of a word."""""" return len(word) tools = [get_word_length] ``` Now let us create the prompt. Because OpenAI Function Calling is finetuned for tool usage, we hardly need any instructions on how to reason, or how to output format. We will just have two input variables: `input` and `agent_scratchpad`. `input` should be a string containing the user objective. `agent_scratchpad` should be a sequence of messages that contains the previous agent tool invocations and the corresponding tool outputs. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are very powerful assistant, but bad at calculating lengths of words."", ), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` How does the agent know what tools it can use? In this case we\'re relying on OpenAI function calling LLMs, which take functions as a separate argument and have been specifically trained to know when to invoke those functions. To pass in our tools to the agent, we just need to format them to the OpenAI function format and pass them to our model. (By `bind`-ing the functions, we\'re making sure that they\'re passed in each time the model is invoked.) ```python from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function llm_with_tools = llm.bind(functions=[format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools]) ``` Putting those pieces together, we can now create the agent. We will import two last utility functions: a component for formatting intermediate steps (agent action, tool output pairs) to input messages that can be sent to the model, and a component for converting the output message into an agent action/agent finish. ```python from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.agents.output_parsers import OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) ``` Now that we have our agent, let\'s play around with it! Let\'s pass in a simple question and empty intermediate steps and see what it returns: ```python agent.invoke({""input"": ""how many letters in the word educa?"", ""intermediate_steps"": []}) ``` ```text AgentActionMessageLog(tool=\'get_word_length\', tool_input={\'word\': \'educa\'}, log=""\\nInvoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}`\\n\\n\\n"", message_log=[AIMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={\'function_call\': {\'arguments\': \'{\\n ""word"": ""educa""\\n}\', \'name\': \'get_word_length\'}})]) ``` We can see that it responds with an `AgentAction` to take (it\'s actually an `AgentActionMessageLog` - a subclass of `AgentAction` which also tracks the full message log). If we\'ve set up LangSmith, we\'ll see a trace that let\'s us inspect the input and output to each step in the sequence: [ ### Define the runtime So this is just the first step - now we need to write a runtime for this. The simplest one is just one that continuously loops, calling the agent, then taking the action, and repeating until an `AgentFinish` is returned. Let\'s code that up below: ```python from langchain.schema.agent import AgentFinish user_input = ""how many letters in the word educa?"" intermediate_steps = [] while True: output = agent.invoke( { ""input"": user_input, ""intermediate_steps"": intermediate_steps, } ) if isinstance(output, AgentFinish): final_result = output.return_values[""output""] break else: print(f""TOOL NAME: {output.tool}"") print(f""TOOL INPUT: {output.tool_input}"") tool = {""get_word_length"": get_word_length}[output.tool] observation = tool.run(output.tool_input) intermediate_steps.append((output, observation)) print(final_result) ``` ```text TOOL NAME: get_word_length TOOL INPUT: {\'word\': \'educa\'} There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". ``` Woo! It\'s working. ### Using AgentExecutor To simplify this a bit, we can import and use the `AgentExecutor` class. This bundles up all of the above and adds in error handling, early stopping, tracing, and other quality-of-life improvements that reduce safeguards you need to write. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` Now let\'s test it out! ```python agent_executor.invoke({""input"": ""how many letters in the word educa?""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Invoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}` 5There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". > Finished chain. {\'input\': \'how many letters in the word educa?\', \'output\': \'There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"".\'} ``` And looking at the trace, we can see that all of our agent calls and tool invocations are automatically logged: [ ### Adding memory This is great - we have an agent! However, this agent is stateless - it doesn\'t remember anything about previous interactions. This means you can\'t ask follow up questions easily. Let\'s fix that by adding in memory. In order to do this, we need to do two things: 1. Add a place for memory variables to go in the prompt 2. Keep track of the chat history First, let\'s add a place for memory in the prompt. We do this by adding a placeholder for messages with the key `""chat_history""`. Notice that we put this ABOVE the new user input (to follow the conversation flow). ```python from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder MEMORY_KEY = ""chat_history"" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are very powerful assistant, but bad at calculating lengths of words."", ), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=MEMORY_KEY), (""user"", ""{input}""), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""agent_scratchpad""), ] ) ``` We can then set up a list to track the chat history ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage chat_history = [] ``` We can then put it all together! ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), ""chat_history"": lambda x: x[""chat_history""], } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` When running, we now need to track the inputs and outputs as chat history ```python input1 = ""how many letters in the word educa?"" result = agent_executor.invoke({""input"": input1, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend( [ HumanMessage(content=input1), AIMessage(content=result[""output""]), ] ) agent_executor.invoke({""input"": ""is that a real word?"", ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Invoking: `get_word_length` with `{\'word\': \'educa\'}` 5There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"". > Finished chain. > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... No, ""educa"" is not a real word in English. > Finished chain. {\'input\': \'is that a real word?\', \'chat_history\': [HumanMessage(content=\'how many letters in the word educa?\'), AIMessage(content=\'There are 5 letters in the word ""educa"".\')], \'output\': \'No, ""educa"" is not a real word in English.\'} ``` Here\'s the LangSmith trace: [ ## Next Steps Awesome!

See [full docs here]( Most connectors available today are focused on read-only operations, limiting the potential of LLMs. Agents, on the other hand, have a tendency to hallucinate from time to time due to missing context or instructions. With `Lemon AI`, it is possible to give your agents access to well-defined APIs for reliable read and write operations. In addition, `Lemon AI` functions allow you to further reduce the risk of hallucinations by providing a way to statically define workflows that the model can rely on in case of uncertainty. ## Quick Start The following quick start demonstrates how to use Lemon AI in combination with Agents to automate workflows that involve interaction with internal tooling. ### 1. Install Lemon AI Requires Python 3.8.1 and above. To use Lemon AI in your Python project run `pip install lemonai` This will install the corresponding Lemon AI client which you can then import into your script. The tool uses Python packages langchain and loguru. In case of any installation errors with Lemon AI, install both packages first and then install the Lemon AI package. ### 2. Launch the Server The interaction of your agents and all tools provided by Lemon AI is handled by the [Lemon AI Server]( To use Lemon AI you need to run the server on your local machine so the Lemon AI Python client can connect to it. ### 3. Use Lemon AI with Langchain Lemon AI automatically solves given tasks by finding the right combination of relevant tools or uses Lemon AI Functions as an alternative. The following example demonstrates how to retrieve a user from Hackernews and write it to a table in Airtable: #### (Optional) Define your Lemon AI Functions Similar to [OpenAI functions]( Lemon AI provides the option to define workflows as reusable functions. These functions can be defined for use cases where it is especially important to move as close as possible to near-deterministic behavior. Specific workflows can be defined in a separate lemonai.json: ```json [ { ""name"": ""Hackernews Airtable User Workflow"", ""description"": ""retrieves user data from Hackernews and appends it to a table in Airtable"", ""tools"": [""hackernews-get-user"", ""airtable-append-data""] } ] ``` Your model will have access to these functions and will prefer them over self-selecting tools to solve a given task. All you have to do is to let the agent know that it should use a given function by including the function name in the prompt. #### Include Lemon AI in your Langchain project ```python import os from langchain.llms import OpenAI from lemonai import execute_workflow ``` #### Load API Keys and Access Tokens To use tools that require authentication, you have to store the corresponding access credentials in your environment in the format ""{tool name}_{authentication string}"" where the authentication string is one of [""API_KEY"", ""SECRET_KEY"", ""SUBSCRIPTION_KEY"", ""ACCESS_KEY""] for API keys or [""ACCESS_TOKEN"", ""SECRET_TOKEN""] for authentication tokens. Examples are ""OPENAI_API_KEY"", ""BING_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY"", ""AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN"". ```python """""" Load all relevant API Keys and Access Tokens into your environment variables """""" os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = ""*INSERT OPENAI API KEY HERE*"" os.environ[""AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN""] = ""*INSERT AIRTABLE TOKEN HERE*"" ``` ```python hackernews_username = ""*INSERT HACKERNEWS USERNAME HERE*"" airtable_base_id = ""*INSERT BASE ID HERE*"" airtable_table_id = ""*INSERT TABLE ID HERE*"" """""" Define your instruction to be given to your LLM """""" prompt = f""""""Read information from Hackernews for user {hackernews_username} and then write the results to Airtable (baseId: {airtable_base_id}, tableId: {airtable_table_id}). Only write the fields ""username"", ""karma"" and ""created_at_i"". Please make sure that Airtable does NOT automatically convert the field types.

Gain transparency on your Agent\'s decision making To gain transparency on how your Agent interacts with Lemon AI tools to solve a given task, all decisions made, tools used and operations performed are written to a local `lemonai.log` file. Every time your LLM agent is interacting with the Lemon AI tool stack a corresponding log entry is created. ```log 2023-06-26T11:50:27.708785+0100 - b5f91c59-8487-45c2-800a-156eac0c7dae - hackernews-get-user 2023-06-26T11:50:39.624035+0100 - b5f91c59-8487-45c2-800a-156eac0c7dae - airtable-append-data 2023-06-26T11:58:32.925228+0100 - 5efe603c-9898-4143-b99a-55b50007ed9d - hackernews-get-user 2023-06-26T11:58:43.988788+0100 - 5efe603c-9898-4143-b99a-55b50007ed9d - airtable-append-data ``` By using the [Lemon AI Analytics]( you can easily gain a better understanding of how frequently and in which order tools are used. As a result, you can identify weak spots in your agent\'s decision-making capabilities and move to a more deterministic behavior by defining Lemon AI functions. - [Quick Start](#quick-start)- [1.

Here's a pseudo-code example:

```python

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved. I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now. It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue it\'s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables. My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\'ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use! I didn\'t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+.

23,What's a runnable lambda?,"['Dynamically route logic based on input | Dynamically route logic based on input This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language. Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`.

Router chains are made up of two components: - The `RouterChain` itself (responsible for selecting the next chain to call) - `destination_chains`: chains that the router chain can route to In this example, we will focus on the different types of routing chains. We will show these routing chains used in a `MultiPromptChain` to create a question-answering chain that selects the prompt which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using that prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.chains.router import MultiPromptChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` ### [Legacy] LLMRouterChain This chain uses an LLM to determine how to route things. ```python prompt_infos = [ { ""name"": ""physics"", ""description"": ""Good for answering questions about physics"", ""prompt_template"": physics_template, }, { ""name"": ""math"", ""description"": ""Good for answering math questions"", ""prompt_template"": math_template, }, ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() ``` ```python destination_chains = {} for p_info in prompt_infos: name = p_info[""name""] prompt_template = p_info[""prompt_template""] prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=[""input""]) chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) destination_chains[name] = chain default_chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, output_key=""text"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains.router.llm_router import LLMRouterChain, RouterOutputParser from langchain.chains.router.multi_prompt_prompt import MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE ``` ```python destinations = [f""{p[\'name\']}: {p[\'description\']}"" for p in prompt_infos] destinations_str = ""\\n"".join(destinations) router_template = MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE.format(destinations=destinations_str) router_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=router_template, input_variables=[""input""], output_parser=RouterOutputParser(), ) router_chain = LLMRouterChain.from_llm(llm, router_prompt) ``` ```python chain = MultiPromptChain( router_chain=router_chain, destination_chains=destination_chains, default_chain=default_chain, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is black body radiation?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is black body radiation?\'} > Finished chain.

It is a characteristic of the temperature of the body; if the body has a uniform temperature, the radiation is also uniform across the spectrum of frequencies. The spectral characteristics of the radiation are determined by the temperature of the body, which implies that a black body at a given temperature will emit the same amount of radiation at every frequency. ``` ```python print( chain.run( ""What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?"" ) ) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( math: {\'input\': \'What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?\'} > Finished chain. The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43. This can be seen by breaking down the problem: 1) We know that a prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and one. 2) We also know that if a number is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. So, if we want to find the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3, we can start counting up from 40, testing each number to see if it is prime and if the sum of the number and one is divisible by three. The first number we come to that satisfies these conditions is 43. ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?\'} > Finished chain.

This example demonstrates using Langchain with models deployed on Baseten. # Setup To run this notebook, you\'ll need a [Baseten account]( and an [API key]( You\'ll also need to install the Baseten Python package: ```bash pip install baseten ``` ```python import baseten baseten.login(""YOUR_API_KEY"") ``` # Single model call First, you\'ll need to deploy a model to Baseten. You can deploy foundation models like WizardLM and Alpaca with one click from the [Baseten model library]( or if you have your own model, [deploy it with this tutorial]( In this example, we\'ll work with WizardLM. [Deploy WizardLM here]( and follow along with the deployed [model\'s version ID]( ```python from langchain.llms import Baseten ``` ```python # Load the model wizardlm = Baseten(model=""MODEL_VERSION_ID"", verbose=True) ``` ```python # Prompt the model wizardlm(""What is the difference between a Wizard and a Sorcerer?"") ``` # Chained model calls We can chain together multiple calls to one or multiple models, which is the whole point of Langchain! This example uses WizardLM to plan a meal with an entree, three sides, and an alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage pairing. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain, SimpleSequentialChain from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` ```python # Build the first link in the chain prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""cuisine""], template=""Name a complex entree for a {cuisine} dinner. Respond with just the name of a single dish."", ) link_one = LLMChain(llm=wizardlm, prompt=prompt) ``` ```python # Build the second link in the chain prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""entree""], template=""What are three sides that would go with {entree}. Respond with only a list of the sides."", ) link_two = LLMChain(llm=wizardlm, prompt=prompt) ``` ```python # Build the third link in the chain prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""sides""], template=""What is one alcoholic and one non-alcoholic beverage that would go well with this list of sides: {sides}. Respond with only the names of the beverages."", ) link_three = LLMChain(llm=wizardlm, prompt=prompt) ``` ```python # Run the full chain! menu_maker = SimpleSequentialChain( chains=[link_one, link_two, link_three], verbose=True ) menu_maker.run(""South Indian"") ```', 'LLM | LLM The most common type of chaining in any LLM application is combining a prompt template with an LLM and optionally an output parser. The recommended way to do this is using LangChain Expression Language. We also continue to support the legacy `LLMChain`, which is a single class for composing these three components. ## Using LCEL `BasePromptTemplate`, `BaseLanguageModel` and `BaseOutputParser` all implement the `Runnable` interface and are designed to be piped into one another, making LCEL composition very easy: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"" ) runnable = prompt | ChatOpenAI() | StrOutputParser() runnable.invoke({""product"": ""colorful socks""}) ``` ```text \'VibrantSocks\' ``` Head to the [LCEL](/docs/expression_language) section for more on the interface, built-in features, and cookbook examples. ## [Legacy] LLMChain This is a legacy class, using LCEL as shown above is preffered.An `LLMChain` is a simple chain that adds some functionality around language models. It is used widely throughout LangChain, including in other chains and agents. An `LLMChain` consists of a `PromptTemplate` and a language model (either an LLM or chat model). It formats the prompt template using the input key values provided (and also memory key values, if available), passes the formatted string to LLM and returns the LLM output. ### Get started ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = ""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"" llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template)) llm_chain(""colorful socks"") ``` ```text {\'product\': \'colorful socks\', \'text\': \'\\n\\nSocktastic!\'} ``` ### Additional ways of running LLMChain Aside from `__call__` and `run` methods shared by all `Chain` object, `LLMChain` offers a few more ways of calling the chain logic: - `apply` allows you run the chain against a list of inputs: ```python input_list = [{""product"": ""socks""}, {""product"": ""computer""}, {""product"": ""shoes""}] llm_chain.apply(input_list) ``` ```text [{\'text\': \'\\n\\nSocktastic!\'}, {\'text\': \'\\n\\nTechCore Solutions.\'}, {\'text\': \'\\n\\nFootwear Factory.\'}] ``` - `generate` is similar to `apply`, except it return an `LLMResult` instead of string. `LLMResult` often contains useful generation such as token usages and finish reason. ```python llm_chain.generate(input_list) ``` ```text LLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text=\'\\n\\nSocktastic!\', generation_info={\'finish_reason\': \'stop\', \'logprobs\': None})], [Generation(text=\'\\n\\nTechCore Solutions.\', generation_info={\'finish_reason\': \'stop\', \'logprobs\': None})], [Generation(text=\'\\n\\nFootwear Factory.\', generation_info={\'finish_reason\': \'stop\', \'logprobs\': None})]], llm_output={\'token_usage\': {\'completion_tokens\': 19, \'prompt_tokens\': 36, \'total_tokens\': 55}, \'model_name\': \'text-davinci-003\'}, run=[RunInfo(run_id=UUID(\'9a423a43-6d35-4e8f-9aca-cacfc8e0dc49\')), RunInfo(run_id=UUID(\'a879c077-b521-461c-8f29-ba63adfc327c\')), RunInfo(run_id=UUID(\'40b892fa-e8c2-47d0-a309-4f7a4ed5b64a\'))]) ``` - `predict` is similar to `run` method except that the input keys are specified as keyword arguments instead of a Python dict. ```python # Single input example llm_chain.predict(product=""colorful socks"") ``` ```text \'\\n\\nSocktastic!\' ``` ```python # Multiple inputs example template = """"""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {subject}."""""" prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[""adjective"", ""subject""]) llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=OpenAI(temperature=0)) llm_chain.predict(adjective=""sad"", subject=""ducks"") ``` ```text \'\\n\\nQ: What did the duck say when his friend died?\\nA: Quack, quack, goodbye.\' ``` ### Parsing the outputs By default, `LLMChain` does not parse the output even if the underlying `prompt` object has an output parser. If you would like to apply that output parser on the LLM output, use `predict_and_parse` instead of `predict` and `apply_and_parse` instead of `apply`. With `predict`: ```python from langchain.output_parsers import CommaSeparatedListOutputParser output_parser = CommaSeparatedListOutputParser() template = """"""List all the colors in a rainbow"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( template=template, input_variables=[], output_parser=output_parser ) llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm) llm_chain.predict() ``` ```text \'\\n\\nRed, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet\' ``` With `predict_and_parse`: ```python llm_chain.predict_and_parse() ``` ```text /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( [\'Red\', \'orange\', \'yellow\', \'green\', \'blue\', \'indigo\', \'violet\'] ``` ### Initialize from string You can also construct an `LLMChain` from a string template directly. ```python template = """"""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {subject}."""""" llm_chain = LLMChain.from_string(llm=llm, template=template) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(adjective=""sad"", subject=""ducks"") ``` ```text \'\\n\\nQ: What did the duck say when his friend died?\\nA: Quack, quack, goodbye.\' ``` - [Using LCEL](#using-lcel) - [Legacy LLMChain](#legacy-llmchain)', 'CerebriumAI | CerebriumAI `Cerebrium` is an AWS Sagemaker alternative.

There does not appear to be solid consensus on how best to do few-shot prompting, and the optimal prompt compilation will likely vary by model. Because of this, we provide few-shot prompt templates like the [FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate]( as a flexible starting point, and you can modify or replace them as you see fit. The goal of few-shot prompt templates are to dynamically select examples based on an input, and then format the examples in a final prompt to provide for the model. **Note:** The following code examples are for chat models. For similar few-shot prompt examples for completion models (LLMs), see the [few-shot prompt templates](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/few_shot_examples) guide. ### Fixed Examples The most basic (and common) few-shot prompting technique is to use a fixed prompt example. This way you can select a chain, evaluate it, and avoid worrying about additional moving parts in production. The basic components of the template are: - `examples`: A list of dictionary examples to include in the final prompt. - `example_prompt`: converts each example into 1 or more messages through its [format_messages]( method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message. Below is a simple demonstration. First, import the modules for this example: ```python from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate, ) ``` Then, define the examples you\'d like to include. ```python examples = [ {""input"": ""2+2"", ""output"": ""4""}, {""input"": ""2+3"", ""output"": ""5""}, ] ``` Next, assemble them into the few-shot prompt template. ```python # This is a prompt template used to format each individual example. example_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""human"", ""{input}""), (""ai"", ""{output}""), ] ) few_shot_prompt = FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate( example_prompt=example_prompt, examples=examples, ) print(few_shot_prompt.format()) ``` ```text Human: 2+2 AI: 4 Human: 2+3 AI: 5 ``` Finally, assemble your final prompt and use it with a model. ```python final_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a wondrous wizard of math.""), few_shot_prompt, (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic chain = final_prompt | ChatAnthropic(temperature=0.0) chain.invoke({""input"": ""What\'s the square of a triangle?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\' Triangles do not have a ""square"". A square refers to a shape with 4 equal sides and 4 right angles. Triangles have 3 sides and 3 angles.\\n\\nThe area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:\\n\\nA = 1/2 * b * h\\n\\nWhere:\\n\\nA is the area \\nb is the base (the length of one of the sides)\\nh is the height (the length from the base to the opposite vertex)\\n\\nSo the area depends on the specific dimensions of the triangle. There is no single ""square of a triangle"". The area can vary greatly depending on the base and height measurements.\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` ## Dynamic few-shot prompting Sometimes you may want to condition which examples are shown based on the input. For this, you can replace the `examples` with an `example_selector`. The other components remain the same as above! To review, the dynamic few-shot prompt template would look like: - `example_selector`: responsible for selecting few-shot examples (and the order in which they are returned) for a given input. These implement the [BaseExampleSelector]( interface. A common example is the vectorstore-backed [SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector]( - `example_prompt`: convert each example into 1 or more messages through its [format_messages]( method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message. These once again can be composed with other messages and chat templates to assemble your final prompt. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.prompts import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` Since we are using a vectorstore to select examples based on semantic similarity, we will want to first populate the store. ```python examples = [ {""input"": ""2+2"", ""output"": ""4""}, {""input"": ""2+3"", ""output"": ""5""}, {""input"": ""2+4"", ""output"": ""6""}, {""input"": ""What did the cow say to the moon?"", ""output"": ""nothing at all""}, { ""input"": ""Write me a poem about the moon"", ""output"": ""One for the moon, and one for me, who are we to talk about the moon?"", }, ] to_vectorize = ["" "".join(example.values()) for example in examples] embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectorstore = Chroma.from_texts(to_vectorize, embeddings, metadatas=examples) ``` #### Create the example_selector With a vectorstore created, you can create the `example_selector`. Here we will isntruct it to only fetch the top 2 examples. ```python example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector( vectorstore=vectorstore, k=2, ) # The prompt template will load examples by passing the input do the `select_examples` method example_selector.select_examples({""input"": ""horse""}) ``` ```text [{\'input\': \'What did the cow say to the moon?\', \'output\': \'nothing at all\'}, {\'input\': \'2+4\', \'output\': \'6\'}] ``` #### Create prompt template Assemble the prompt template, using the `example_selector` created above. ```python from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate, ) # Define the few-shot prompt. few_shot_prompt = FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate( # The input variables select the values to pass to the example_selector input_variables=[""input""], example_selector=example_selector, # Define how each example will be formatted. # In this case, each example will become 2 messages: # 1 human, and 1 AI example_prompt=ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [(""human"", ""{input}""), (""ai"", ""{output}"")] ), ) ``` Below is an example of how this would be assembled. ```python print(few_shot_prompt.format(input=""What\'s 3+3?"")) ``` ```text Human: 2+3 AI: 5 Human: 2+2 AI: 4 ``` Assemble the final prompt template: ```python final_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a wondrous wizard of math.""), few_shot_prompt, (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) ``` ```python print(few_shot_prompt.format(input=""What\'s 3+3?"")) ``` ```text Human: 2+3 AI: 5 Human: 2+2 AI: 4 ``` #### Use with an LLM Now, you can connect your model to the few-shot prompt. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic chain = final_prompt | ChatAnthropic(temperature=0.0) chain.invoke({""input"": ""What\'s 3+3?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\' 3 + 3 = 6\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` - [Fixed Examples](#fixed-examples) - [Dynamic few-shot prompting](#dynamic-few-shot-prompting)']","A prompt template is a general template for generating prompts, while a chat prompt template is specifically designed for chat-based interactions.","A prompt template wraps instructions, examples, and other formatting information for the llm's prompts.

26,What is ConversationSummaryBufferMemory?,"['Conversation Summary Buffer | Conversation Summary Buffer `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` combines the two ideas. It keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, but rather than just completely flushing old interactions it compiles them into a summary and uses both. It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. Let\'s first walk through how to use the utilities. ## Using memory with LLM ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory llm = OpenAI() ``` ```python memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'System: \\nThe human says ""hi"", and the AI responds with ""whats up"".\\nHuman: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model). ```python memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory( llm=llm, max_token_limit=10, return_messages=True ) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` We can also utilize the `predict_new_summary` method directly. ```python messages = memory.chat_memory.messages previous_summary = """" memory.predict_new_summary(messages, previous_summary) ``` ```text \'\\nThe human and AI state that they are not doing much.\' ``` ## Using in a chain Let\'s walk through an example, again setting `verbose=True` so we can see the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain( llm=llm, # We set a very low max_token_limit for the purposes of testing. memory=ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=OpenAI(), max_token_limit=40), verbose=True, ) conversation_with_summary.predict(input=""Hi, what\'s up?"") ``` ```text > Entering new ConversationChain chain...

The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\\nBe data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data\\nBe agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment\\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.\\nGetting Started\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\nGetting Started Documentation\\nModules\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\nModels: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\nUse Cases\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\nPersonal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\\nQuestion Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\nInteracting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\\nExtraction: Extract structured information from text.\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nReference Docs\\nAll of LangChain\'s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.\\nReference Documentation\\nLangChain Ecosystem\\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\\nLangChain Ecosystem\\nAdditional Resources\\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!\\nLangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\\nGlossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\\nGallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\\nDeployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\\nTracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\\nModel Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application.

This allows us to use the embeddings to do semantic retrieval / search. We can find a few closest embeddings in the documents embeddings based on the cosine similarity, and retrieve the corresponding document using the `KNNRetriever` class from LangChain. ```python from langchain.retrievers import KNNRetriever retriever = KNNRetriever.from_texts(documents, embeddings) # retrieve the most relevant documents result = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) top1_retrieved_doc = result[0].page_content # return the top1 retrieved result print(top1_retrieved_doc) ``` ```text An LLMChain is a chain that composes basic LLM functionality.

The Embeddings class is a class designed for interfacing with text embedding models. There are lots of embedding model providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - this class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them. Embeddings create a vector representation of a piece of text. This is useful because it means we can think about text in the vector space, and do things like semantic search where we look for pieces of text that are most similar in the vector space. The base Embeddings class in LangChain provides two methods: one for embedding documents and one for embedding a query. The former takes as input multiple texts, while the latter takes a single text. The reason for having these as two separate methods is that some embedding providers have different embedding methods for documents (to be searched over) vs queries (the search query itself). ## Get started ### Setup To start we\'ll need to install the OpenAI Python package: ```bash pip install openai ``` Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading [here]( Once we have a key we\'ll want to set it as an environment variable by running: ```bash export OPENAI_API_KEY=""..."" ``` If you\'d prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the `openai_api_key` named parameter when initiating the OpenAI LLM class: ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=""..."") ``` Otherwise you can initialize without any params: ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ### embed_documents #### Embed list of texts ```python embeddings = embeddings_model.embed_documents( [ ""Hi there!"", ""Oh, hello!"", ""What\'s your name?"", ""My friends call me World"", ""Hello World!"" ] ) len(embeddings), len(embeddings[0]) ``` ```text (5, 1536) ``` ### embed_query #### Embed single query Embed a single piece of text for the purpose of comparing to other embedded pieces of texts. ```python embedded_query = embeddings_model.embed_query(""What was the name mentioned in the conversation?"") embedded_query[:5] ``` ```text [0.0053587136790156364, -0.0004999046213924885, 0.038883671164512634, -0.003001077566295862, -0.00900818221271038] ``` - [Get started](#get-started)- [Setup](#setup) - [embed_documents](#embed_documents) - [embed_query](#embed_query)', 'Helicone | Helicone This page covers how to use the [Helicone]( ecosystem within LangChain. ## What is Helicone?

But, retrieval may produce different results with subtle changes in query wording or if the embeddings do not capture the semantics of the data well. Prompt engineering / tuning is sometimes done to manually address these problems, but can be tedious. The `MultiQueryRetriever` automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents. By generating multiple perspectives on the same question, the `MultiQueryRetriever` might be able to overcome some of the limitations of the distance-based retrieval and get a richer set of results. ```python # Build a sample vectorDB from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma # Load blog post loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() # Split text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) # VectorDB embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=embedding) ``` #### Simple usage Specify the LLM to use for query generation, and the retriever will do the rest. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetriever question = ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) retriever_from_llm = MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm( retriever=vectordb.as_retriever(), llm=llm ) ``` ```python # Set logging for the queries import logging logging.basicConfig() logging.getLogger(""langchain.retrievers.multi_query"").setLevel(logging.INFO) ``` ```python unique_docs = retriever_from_llm.get_relevant_documents(query=question) len(unique_docs) ``` ```text INFO:langchain.retrievers.multi_query:Generated queries: [\'1.

It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input.

Router chains are made up of two components: - The `RouterChain` itself (responsible for selecting the next chain to call) - `destination_chains`: chains that the router chain can route to In this example, we will focus on the different types of routing chains. We will show these routing chains used in a `MultiPromptChain` to create a question-answering chain that selects the prompt which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using that prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.chains.router import MultiPromptChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` ### [Legacy] LLMRouterChain This chain uses an LLM to determine how to route things. ```python prompt_infos = [ { ""name"": ""physics"", ""description"": ""Good for answering questions about physics"", ""prompt_template"": physics_template, }, { ""name"": ""math"", ""description"": ""Good for answering math questions"", ""prompt_template"": math_template, }, ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() ``` ```python destination_chains = {} for p_info in prompt_infos: name = p_info[""name""] prompt_template = p_info[""prompt_template""] prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=[""input""]) chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) destination_chains[name] = chain default_chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, output_key=""text"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains.router.llm_router import LLMRouterChain, RouterOutputParser from langchain.chains.router.multi_prompt_prompt import MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE ``` ```python destinations = [f""{p[\'name\']}: {p[\'description\']}"" for p in prompt_infos] destinations_str = ""\\n"".join(destinations) router_template = MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE.format(destinations=destinations_str) router_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=router_template, input_variables=[""input""], output_parser=RouterOutputParser(), ) router_chain = LLMRouterChain.from_llm(llm, router_prompt) ``` ```python chain = MultiPromptChain( router_chain=router_chain, destination_chains=destination_chains, default_chain=default_chain, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is black body radiation?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is black body radiation?\'} > Finished chain.

The spectral characteristics of the radiation are determined by the temperature of the body, which implies that a black body at a given temperature will emit the same amount of radiation at every frequency. ``` ```python print( chain.run( ""What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?"" ) ) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( math: {\'input\': \'What is the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3?\'} > Finished chain. The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43. This can be seen by breaking down the problem: 1) We know that a prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and one. 2) We also know that if a number is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. So, if we want to find the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3, we can start counting up from 40, testing each number to see if it is prime and if the sum of the number and one is divisible by three. The first number we come to that satisfies these conditions is 43. ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?\'} > Finished chain.

The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process. For example, if the task is to write a novel, the agent can be instructed to ""Write a story outline."" This provides a high-level structure for the task and helps in breaking it down into smaller components.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Agents can also take inputs from humans to decompose tasks. This can be done through direct communication or by leveraging human expertise. Humans can provide guidance and insights to help the agent break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals.\\n\\nOverall, task decomposition allows agents to break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable subgoals, enabling them to plan and execute complex tasks efficiently.\'} ``` ```python qa(""What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'What are the various ways to implement memory to support it?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'The human asks how agents use task decomposition.

Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents. This allows for easy retrieval and reference during the execution of the task.\\n\\nThese memory resources help the agent in organizing and managing information, making informed decisions, and effectively decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals.\'} ``` Again, we can use the [LangSmith trace]( to explore the prompt structure. ### Going deeper - Agents, such as the [conversational retrieval agent](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents), can be used for retrieval when necessary while also holding a conversation. - [Use case](#use-case) - [Overview](#overview) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Memory](#memory) - [Conversation](#conversation) - [Chat Retrieval](#chat-retrieval)- [Going deeper](#going-deeper)', 'Customizing Conversational Memory | Customizing Conversational Memory This notebook walks through a few ways to customize conversational memory. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ## AI prefix The first way to do so is by changing the AI prefix in the conversation summary.

The `MultiQueryRetriever` automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents.

RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.

And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer: ``` We\'ll use the [LCEL Runnable]( protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box ```python from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python for chunk in rag_chain.stream(""What is Task Decomposition?""): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Task decomposition can be performed by AI models with prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ### Go deeper #### Choosing LLMs `ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model wrapper. Takes in a sequence of messages and returns a message. - [Docs](/docs/modules/model_io/chat/) - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/chat/): Explore over 25 `ChatModel` integrations. `LLM`: A text-in-text-out LLM.

See a guide on RAG with locally-running models [here](/docs/modules/use_cases/question_answering/local_retrieval_qa). #### Customizing the prompt As shown above, we can load prompts (e.g., [this RAG prompt]( from the prompt hub. The prompt can also be easily customized: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate template = """"""Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know, don\'t try to make up an answer. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer as concise as possible. Always say ""thanks for asking!"" at the end of the answer. {context} Question: {question} Helpful Answer:"""""" rag_prompt_custom = PromptTemplate.from_template(template) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | rag_prompt_custom | llm | StrOutputParser() ) rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is the process of breaking down a complex task into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the problem into multiple thought steps and generating multiple thoughts per step.

It involves transforming big tasks into multiple manageable tasks, allowing for a more systematic and organized approach to problem-solving. Thanks for asking!\'} ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( Adding memory Suppose we want to create a stateful application that remembers past user inputs. There are two main things we need to do to support this. 1. Add a messages placeholder to our chain which allows us to pass in historical messages 2. Add a chain that takes the latest user query and reformulates it in the context of the chat history into a standalone question that can be passed to our retriever. Let\'s start with 2. We can build a ""condense question"" chain that looks something like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder condense_q_system_prompt = """"""Given a chat history and the latest user question \\ which might reference the chat history, formulate a standalone question \\ which can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \\ just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."""""" condense_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", condense_q_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) condense_q_chain = condense_q_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""What is meant by large"", } ) ``` ```text \'What is the definition of ""large"" in the context of a language model?\' ``` ```python condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""How do transformers work"", } ) ``` ```text \'How do transformer models function?\' ``` And now we can build our full QA chain. Notice we add some routing functionality to only run the ""condense question chain"" when our chat history isn\'t empty. ```python qa_system_prompt = """"""You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \\ Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. \\ If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. \\ Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\ {context}"""""" qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", qa_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) def condense_question(input: dict): if input.get(""chat_history""): return condense_q_chain else: return input[""question""] rag_chain = ( RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=condense_question | retriever | format_docs) | qa_prompt | llm ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] question = ""What is Task Decomposition?"" ai_msg = rag_chain.invoke({""question"": question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=question), ai_msg]) second_question = ""What are common ways of doing it?"" rag_chain.invoke({""question"": second_question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'Common ways of task decomposition include:\\n\\n1.

Common examples of these types of applications include:\\\\n Question Answering over specific documents\\\\n\\\\nDocumentation\\\\nEnd-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database\\\\n\\\\n Chatbots\\\\n\\\\nDocumentation\\\\nEnd-to-end Example: Chat-LangChain\\\\n\\\\n Agents\\\\n\\\\nDocumentation\\\\nEnd-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGetting Started#\\\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\\\n\\\\nGetting Started Documentation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nModules#\\\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\\\\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\\\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\\\n\\\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\\\nLLMs: This includes a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.\\\\nDocument Loaders: This includes a standard interface for loading documents, as well as specific integrations to all types of text data sources.\\\\nUtils: Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more. LangChain provides a large collection of common utils to use in your application.\\\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\\\nChat: Chat models are a variation on Language Models that expose a different API - rather than working with raw text, they work with messages. LangChain provides a standard interface for working with them and doing all the same things as above.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUse Cases#\\\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\\\n\\\\nAgents: Agents are systems that use a language model to interact with other tools. These can be used to do more grounded question/answering, interact with APIs, or even take actions.\\\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\\\nData Augmented Generation: Data Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external datasource to fetch data to use in the generation step. Examples of this include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.\\\\nQuestion Answering: Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\\\nGenerate similar examples: Generating similar examples to a given input. This is a common use case for many applications, and LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\\\nCompare models: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nReference Docs#\\\\nAll of LangChain\'s reference documentation, in one place.

We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\\\\n\\\\nBe data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data\\\\nBe agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment\\\\n\\\\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\\\\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.\\\\n\\\\nGetting Started#\\\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\\\n\\\\nGetting Started Documentation\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nModules#\\\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\\\\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\\\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\\\n\\\\nModels: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\\\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent.

LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\\\n\\\\nPersonal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\\\\nQuestion Answering: The second big LangChain use case.

The SitemapLoader constructor accepts a custom scraping function. This feature can be helpful to tailor the scraping process to your specific needs; for example, you might want to avoid scraping headers or navigation elements. The following example shows how to develop and use a custom function to avoid navigation and header elements.Import the beautifulsoup4 library and define the custom function.pip install beautifulsoup4from bs4 import BeautifulSoupdef remove_nav_and_header_elements(content: BeautifulSoup) -> str: # Find all \\\'nav\\\' and \\\'header\\\' elements in the BeautifulSoup object nav_elements = content.find_all(""nav"") header_elements = content.find_all(""header"") # Remove each \\\'nav\\\' and \\\'header\\\' element from the BeautifulSoup object for element in nav_elements + header_elements: element.decompose() return str(content.get_text())Add your custom function to the SitemapLoader object.loader = SitemapLoader( "" filter_urls=["" parsing_function=remove_nav_and_header_elements,)Local Sitemap\\u200bThe sitemap loader can also be used to load local files.sitemap_loader = SitemapLoader(web_path=""example_data/sitemap.xml"", is_local=True)docs = sitemap_loader.load() Fetching pages: 100%|####################################################################################################################################| 3/3 [00:00<00:00, 3.91it/s]PreviousRSTNextSlackFiltering sitemap URLsAdd custom scraping rulesLocal SitemapCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogCopyright 2023 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\', metadata={\'source\': \' \'loc\': \' \'changefreq\': \'weekly\', \'priority\': \'0.5\'}) ``` ## Add custom scraping rules By default, the parser **removes** all but the main content of the docusaurus page, which is normally the `` tag. You also have the option to define an **inclusive** list HTML tags by providing them as a list utilizing the `custom_html_tags` parameter. For example: ```python loader = DocusaurusLoader( "" filter_urls=[ "" ], # This will only include the content that matches these tags, otherwise they will be removed custom_html_tags=[""#content"", "".main""], ) ``` You can also define an entirely custom parsing function if you need finer-grained control over the returned content for each page. The following example shows how to develop and use a custom function to avoid navigation and header elements. ```python from bs4 import BeautifulSoup def remove_nav_and_header_elements(content: BeautifulSoup) -> str: # Find all \'nav\' and \'header\' elements in the BeautifulSoup object nav_elements = content.find_all(""nav"") header_elements = content.find_all(""header"") # Remove each \'nav\' and \'header\' element from the BeautifulSoup object for element in nav_elements + header_elements: element.decompose() return str(content.get_text()) ``` Add your custom function to the `DocusaurusLoader` object. ```python loader = DocusaurusLoader( "" filter_urls=[ "" ], parsing_function=remove_nav_and_header_elements, ) ``` - [Filtering sitemap URLs](#filtering-sitemap-urls) - [Add custom scraping rules](#add-custom-scraping-rules)', 'Markdown | Markdown [Markdown]( is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

By default we combine those together, but you can easily keep that separation by specifying `mode=""elements""`. ```python loader = UnstructuredMarkdownLoader(markdown_path, mode=""elements"") ``` ```python data = loader.load() ``` ```python data[0] ``` ```text Document(page_content=\'ð\\x9f¦\\x9cï¸\\x8fð\\x9f”\\x97 LangChain\', metadata={\'source\': \'../../../../../README.md\', \'page_number\': 1, \'category\': \'Title\'}) ``` - [Retain Elements](#retain-elements)', 'Router | Router Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. As a very simple example, let\'s suppose we have two templates optimized for different types of questions, and we want to choose the template based on the user input. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate physics_template = """"""You are a very smart physics professor. \\ You are great at answering questions about physics in a concise and easy to understand manner. \\ When you don\'t know the answer to a question you admit that you don\'t know. Here is a question: {input}"""""" physics_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(physics_template) math_template = """"""You are a very good mathematician. You are great at answering math questions. \\ You are so good because you are able to break down hard problems into their component parts, \\ answer the component parts, and then put them together to answer the broader question. Here is a question: {input}"""""" math_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(math_template) ``` ## Using LCEL We can easily do this using a `RunnableBranch`. A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input.

Router chains are made up of two components: - The `RouterChain` itself (responsible for selecting the next chain to call) - `destination_chains`: chains that the router chain can route to In this example, we will focus on the different types of routing chains. We will show these routing chains used in a `MultiPromptChain` to create a question-answering chain that selects the prompt which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using that prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain from langchain.chains.llm import LLMChain from langchain.chains.router import MultiPromptChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` ### [Legacy] LLMRouterChain This chain uses an LLM to determine how to route things. ```python prompt_infos = [ { ""name"": ""physics"", ""description"": ""Good for answering questions about physics"", ""prompt_template"": physics_template, }, { ""name"": ""math"", ""description"": ""Good for answering math questions"", ""prompt_template"": math_template, }, ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() ``` ```python destination_chains = {} for p_info in prompt_infos: name = p_info[""name""] prompt_template = p_info[""prompt_template""] prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=[""input""]) chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt) destination_chains[name] = chain default_chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, output_key=""text"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains.router.llm_router import LLMRouterChain, RouterOutputParser from langchain.chains.router.multi_prompt_prompt import MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE ``` ```python destinations = [f""{p[\'name\']}: {p[\'description\']}"" for p in prompt_infos] destinations_str = ""\\n"".join(destinations) router_template = MULTI_PROMPT_ROUTER_TEMPLATE.format(destinations=destinations_str) router_prompt = PromptTemplate( template=router_template, input_variables=[""input""], output_parser=RouterOutputParser(), ) router_chain = LLMRouterChain.from_llm(llm, router_prompt) ``` ```python chain = MultiPromptChain( router_chain=router_chain, destination_chains=destination_chains, default_chain=default_chain, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is black body radiation?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is black body radiation?\'} > Finished chain.

The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43. This can be seen by breaking down the problem: 1) We know that a prime number is a number that is only divisible by itself and one. 2) We also know that if a number is divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. So, if we want to find the first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3, we can start counting up from 40, testing each number to see if it is prime and if the sum of the number and one is divisible by three. The first number we come to that satisfies these conditions is 43. ``` ```python print(chain.run(""What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?"")) ``` ```text > Entering new MultiPromptChain chain... /Users/bagatur/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm.py:280: UserWarning: The predict_and_parse method is deprecated, instead pass an output parser directly to LLMChain. warnings.warn( physics: {\'input\': \'What is the name of the type of cloud that rains?\'} > Finished chain.

33,whats an agent type that works well with Anthropic's models and supports structured output?,"['Anthropic | Anthropic All functionality related to Anthropic models. [Anthropic]( is an AI safety and research company, and is the creator of Claude. This page covers all integrations between Anthropic models and LangChain. ## Prompting Overview Claude is chat-based model, meaning it is trained on conversation data. However, it is a text based API, meaning it takes in single string. It expects this string to be in a particular format. This means that it is up the user to ensure that is the case. LangChain provides several utilities and helper functions to make sure prompts that you write - whether formatted as a string or as a list of messages - end up formatted correctly. Specifically, Claude is trained to fill in text for the Assistant role as part of an ongoing dialogue between a human user (`Human:`) and an AI assistant (`Assistant:`). Prompts sent via the API must contain `\\n\\nHuman:` and `\\n\\nAssistant:` as the signals of who\'s speaking. The final turn must always be `\\n\\nAssistant:` - the input string cannot have `\\n\\nHuman:` as the final role. Because Claude is chat-based but accepts a string as input, it can be treated as either a LangChain `ChatModel` or `LLM`. This means there are two wrappers in LangChain - `ChatAnthropic` and `Anthropic`. It is generally recommended to use the `ChatAnthropic` wrapper, and format your prompts as `ChatMessage`s (we will show examples of this below). This is because it keeps your prompt in a general format that you can easily then also use with other models (should you want to). However, if you want more fine-grained control over the prompt, you can use the `Anthropic` wrapper - we will show and example of this as well. The `Anthropic` wrapper however is deprecated, as all functionality can be achieved in a more generic way using `ChatAnthropic`. ## Prompting Best Practices Anthropic models have several prompting best practices compared to OpenAI models. **No System Messages** Anthropic models are not trained on the concept of a ""system message"". We have worked with the Anthropic team to handle them somewhat appropriately (a Human message with an `admin` tag) but this is largely a hack and it is recommended that you do not use system messages. **AI Messages Can Continue** A completion from Claude is a continuation of the last text in the string which allows you further control over Claude\'s output. For example, putting words in Claude\'s mouth in a prompt like this: `\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: What do you call a bear with no teeth?` This will return a completion like this `A gummy bear!` instead of a whole new assistant message with a different random bear joke. ## ChatAnthropic `ChatAnthropic` is a subclass of LangChain\'s `ChatModel`, meaning it works best with `ChatPromptTemplate`. You can import this wrapper with the following code: ```text from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic model = ChatAnthropic() ``` When working with ChatModels, it is preferred that you design your prompts as `ChatPromptTemplate`s. Here is an example below of doing that: ```text from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", ""You are a helpful chatbot""), (""human"", ""Tell me a joke about {topic}""), ]) ``` You can then use this in a chain as follows: ```text chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` How is the prompt actually being formatted under the hood? We can see that by running the following code ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nYou are a helpful chatbot\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that under the hood LangChain is not appending any prefix/suffix to `SystemMessage`\'s. This is because Anthropic has no concept of `SystemMessage`. Anthropic requires all prompts to end with assistant messages. This means if the last message is not an assistant message, the suffix `Assistant:` will automatically be inserted. If you decide instead to use a normal PromptTemplate (one that just works on a single string) let\'s take a look at what happens: ```text from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that it automatically adds the Human and Assistant tags. What is happening under the hood? First: the string gets converted to a single human message. This happens generically (because we are using a subclass of `ChatModel`). Then, similarly to the above example, an empty Assistant message is getting appended. This is Anthropic specific. ## [Deprecated] Anthropic This `Anthropic` wrapper is subclassed from `LLM`. We can import it with: ```text from langchain.llms import Anthropic model = Anthropic() ``` This model class is designed to work with normal PromptTemplates. An example of that is below: ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` Let\'s see what is going on with the prompt templating under the hood! ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs the following ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:\\n\' ``` Notice that it adds the Human tag at the start of the string, and then finishes it with `\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:`. The extra `Sure, here you go` was added on purpose by the Anthropic team. What happens if we have those symbols in the prompt directly? ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Human: Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\' ``` We can see that we detect that the user is trying to use the special tokens, and so we don\'t do any formatting. - [Prompting Overview](#prompting-overview) - [Prompting Best Practices](#prompting-best-practices) - [ChatAnthropic](#chatanthropic) - [Deprecated Anthropic](#deprecated-anthropic)', 'Templates | Templates Highlighting a few different categories of templates ## Popular These are some of the more popular templates to get started with. - [Retrieval Augmented Generation Chatbot](/docs/templates/rag-conversation): Build a chatbot over your data.

Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable.

Load data from Stripe using Airbyte. user the `record_handler`paramater to return a JSON from the data loader. ```python import os import pandas as pd from langchain.agents import AgentType, create_pandas_dataframe_agent from langchain.chat_models.openai import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders.airbyte import AirbyteStripeLoader stream_name = ""customers"" config = { ""client_secret"": os.getenv(""STRIPE_CLIENT_SECRET""), ""account_id"": os.getenv(""STRIPE_ACCOUNT_D""), ""start_date"": ""2023-01-20T00:00:00Z"", } def handle_record(record: dict, _id: str): return record.data loader = AirbyteStripeLoader( config=config, record_handler=handle_record, stream_name=stream_name, ) data = loader.load() ``` 1. Pass the data to `pandas`dataframe. ```python df = pd.DataFrame(data) ``` 1. Pass the dataframe `df` to the `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` and invoke ```python agent = create_pandas_dataframe_agent( ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model=""gpt-4""), df, verbose=True, agent_type=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS, ) ``` 1. Run the agent ```python output = agent.run(""How many rows are there?"") ```', 'Custom Trajectory Evaluator | Custom Trajectory Evaluator []( You can make your own custom trajectory evaluators by inheriting from the [AgentTrajectoryEvaluator]( class and overwriting the `_evaluate_agent_trajectory` (and `_aevaluate_agent_action`) method. In this example, you will make a simple trajectory evaluator that uses an LLM to determine if any actions were unnecessary. ```python from typing import Any, Optional, Sequence, Tuple from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.evaluation import AgentTrajectoryEvaluator from langchain.schema import AgentAction class StepNecessityEvaluator(AgentTrajectoryEvaluator): """"""Evaluate the perplexity of a predicted string."""""" def __init__(self) -> None: llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"", temperature=0.0) template = """"""Are any of the following steps unnecessary in answering {input}? Provide the verdict on a new line as a single ""Y"" for yes or ""N"" for no. DATA ------ Steps: {trajectory} ------ Verdict:"""""" self.chain = LLMChain.from_string(llm, template) def _evaluate_agent_trajectory( self, *, prediction: str, input: str, agent_trajectory: Sequence[Tuple[AgentAction, str]], reference: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs: Any, ) -> dict: vals = [ f""{i}: Action=[{action.tool}] returned observation = [{observation}]"" for i, (action, observation) in enumerate(agent_trajectory) ] trajectory = ""\\n"".join(vals) response = self.chain.run(dict(trajectory=trajectory, input=input), **kwargs) decision = response.split(""\\n"")[-1].strip() score = 1 if decision == ""Y"" else 0 return {""score"": score, ""value"": decision, ""reasoning"": response} ``` The example above will return a score of 1 if the language model predicts that any of the actions were unnecessary, and it returns a score of 0 if all of them were predicted to be necessary. It returns the string \'decision\' as the \'value\', and includes the rest of the generated text as \'reasoning\' to let you audit the decision. You can call this evaluator to grade the intermediate steps of your agent\'s trajectory. ```python evaluator = StepNecessityEvaluator() evaluator.evaluate_agent_trajectory( prediction=""The answer is pi"", input=""What is today?"", agent_trajectory=[ ( AgentAction(tool=""ask"", tool_input=""What is today?"", log=""""), ""tomorrow\'s yesterday"", ), ( AgentAction(tool=""check_tv"", tool_input=""Watch tv for half hour"", log=""""), ""bzzz"", ), ], ) ``` ```text {\'score\': 1, \'value\': \'Y\', \'reasoning\': \'Y\'} ```', 'Conversational | Conversational This walkthrough demonstrates how to use an agent optimized for conversation. Other agents are often optimized for using tools to figure out the best response, which is not ideal in a conversational setting where you may want the agent to be able to chat with the user as well.

I\'m a large language model, which means I\'m trained on a large corpus of text data to generate language outputs that are coherent and natural-sounding. My architecture is based on a transformer model, which is a type of neural network that\'s particularly well-suited for natural language processing tasks. As for my parameters, I have a few billion parameters, but I don\'t have access to the exact number as it\'s not relevant to my functioning. My training data includes a vast amount of text from various sources, including books, articles, and websites, which I use to learn patterns and relationships in language. I\'m designed to be a helpful tool for a variety of tasks, such as answering questions, providing information, and generating text. I\'m constantly learning and improving my abilities through machine learning algorithms and feedback from users like you. I hope this helps! Is there anything else you\'d like to know about me or my capabilities? --- meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf Ah, a fellow tech enthusiast! *adjusts glasses* I\'m glad to share some technical details about myself. Indeed, I\'m a transformer model, specifically a BERT-like language model trained on a large corpus of text data. My architecture is based on the transformer framework, which is a type of neural network designed for natural language processing tasks. As for the number of parameters, I have approximately 340 million. *winks* That\'s a pretty hefty number, if I do say so myself! These parameters allow me to learn and represent complex patterns in language, such as syntax, semantics, and more. But don\'t ask me to do math in my head I\'m a language model, not a calculating machine! My strengths lie in understanding and generating human-like text, so feel free to chat with me anytime you\'d like. Now, do you have any more technical questions for me? Or would you like to engage in a nice chat? --- meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf Hello! As a friendly and helpful AI, I\'d be happy to share some technical facts about myself. I am a transformer-based language model, specifically a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. BERT was developed by Google in 2018 and has since become one of the most popular and widely-used AI language models. Here are some technical details about my capabilities: 1. Parameters: I have approximately 340 million parameters, which are the numbers that I use to learn and represent language. This is a relatively large number of parameters compared to some other languages models, but it allows me to learn and understand complex language patterns and relationships. 2. Training: I was trained on a large corpus of text data, including books, articles, and other sources of written content. This training allows me to learn about the structure and conventions of language, as well as the relationships between words and phrases. 3. Architectures: My architecture is based on the transformer model, which is a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for natural language processing tasks. The transformer model uses self-attention mechanisms to allow the model to ""attend"" to different parts of the input text, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships. 4. Precision: I am capable of generating text with high precision and accuracy, meaning that I can produce text that is close to human-level quality in terms of grammar, syntax, and coherence. 5. Generative capabilities: In addition to being able to generate text based on prompts and questions, I am also capable of generating text based on a given topic or theme. This allows me to create longer, more coherent pieces of text that are organized around a specific idea or concept. Overall, I am a powerful and versatile language model that is capable of a wide range of natural language processing tasks. I am constantly learning and improving, and I am here to help answer any questions you may have! --- CPU times: user 371 ms, sys: 15.5 ms, total: 387 ms Wall time: 12 s ```', 'EverlyAI | EverlyAI [EverlyAI]( allows you to run your ML models at scale in the cloud.

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered ""controversial"" I really had to see this for myself.The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America.

Before crying (or implying) ""double-standard"" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man.

It\\\'s a movie and we can expect that much, if that\\\'s what you\\\'re looking for you\\\'d be better off picking up a copy of Vogue.Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singing, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie\\\'s title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20\\\'s may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. ""They All Laughed"" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn\\\'t prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there\\\'s no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten\\\'s scenes. But ""Laughed"" is a faint echo of ""The Last Picture Show"", ""Paper Moon"" or ""What\\\'s Up, Doc""- following ""Daisy Miller"" and ""At Long Last Love"", it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which P.B. has never emerged.All in all, though, the movie is harmless, only a waste of rental.

He based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters, who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective, doesn\'t it? This entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how out of touch with real people he was. You\'re supposed to write what you know, and he did that, indeed. And leaves the audience bored and confused, and jealous, for that matter. This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot better and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten\'s part seemed forced; added. She doesn\'t have a lot to do with the story, which is pretty convoluted to begin with. All in all, every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with, unless you\'re millionaire from Manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call.

They looked quite wonderful. But that was it. They were not given any characters or good lines to work with.

Five years later, Bogdanovich\\\'s ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called ""Moonlighting"" stealing the story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines.Bottom line: It ain\\\'t no ""Paper Moon"" and only a very pale version of ""What\\\'s Up, Doc"".\', metadata={\'label\': 0}), Document(page_content=""I can\'t believe that those praising this movie herein aren\'t thinking of some other film.

It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in ""Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003"" and \\x96 wow \\x96 four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching ""They All Laughed"" and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in ""Star 80"" and ""Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story""; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song ""Amigo"", from Roberto Carlos.

}

chat = ChatEverlyAI(**config)
```

Save `config` as JSON or similar format.","To save the configuration for a given LLM, you can follow these steps:

First, let's go over loading an LLM configuration from disk. LLM configurations can be saved in two formats: JSON or YAML, but they are loaded in the same way.

For a JSON-formatted LLM configuration (llm.json):

```json
{
    ""model_name"": ""text-davinci-003"",
    ""temperature"": 0.7,
    ""max_tokens"": 256,
    ""top_p"": 1.0,
    ""frequency_penalty"": 0.0,
    ""presence_penalty"": 0.0,
    ""n"": 1,
    ""best_of"": 1,
    ""request_timeout"": null,
    ""_type"": ""openai""
}
```

Load the configuration like this:

```python
from langchain.llms.loading import load_llm

llm = load_llm(""llm.json"")
```

For a YAML-formatted LLM configuration (llm.yaml):

```yaml
_type: openai
best_of: 1
frequency_penalty: 0.0
max_tokens: 256
model_name: text-davinci-003
n: 1
presence_penalty: 0.0
request_timeout: null
temperature: 0.7
top_p: 1.0
```

Load the configuration like this:

```python
from langchain.llms.loading import load_llm

llm = load_llm(""llm.yaml"")
```

To save an LLM configuration from memory to a serialized version, you can use the `.save` method. This method supports both JSON and YAML formats:

```python
llm.save(""llm.json"")
llm.save(""llm.yaml"")
```

This way, you can easily save and load LLM configurations to and from disk.",0.9999999999666667,1.0,0.6,0.41453767789096885,0.0901639344262295

Show this page source', 'Postgres Embedding | Postgres Embedding [Postgres Embedding]( is an open-source vector similarity search for `Postgres` that uses `Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW)` for approximate nearest neighbor search. It supports: - exact and approximate nearest neighbor search using HNSW - L2 distance This notebook shows how to use the Postgres vector database (`PGEmbedding`). The PGEmbedding integration creates the pg_embedding extension for you, but you run the following Postgres query to add it: ```sql CREATE EXTENSION embedding; ``` ```bash # Pip install necessary package pip install openai pip install psycopg2-binary pip install tiktoken ``` Add the OpenAI API Key to the environment variables to use `OpenAIEmbeddings`. ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` ```text OpenAI API Key: ``` ```python ## Loading Environment Variables from typing import List, Tuple ``` ```python from langchain.docstore.document import Document from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import PGEmbedding ``` ```python os.environ[""DATABASE_URL""] = getpass.getpass(""Database Url:"") ``` ```text Database Url: ``` ```python loader = TextLoader(""state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() connection_string = os.environ.get(""DATABASE_URL"") collection_name = ""state_of_the_union"" ``` ```python db = PGEmbedding.from_documents( embedding=embeddings, documents=docs, collection_name=collection_name, connection_string=connection_string, ) query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" docs_with_score: List[Tuple[Document, float]] = db.similarity_search_with_score(query) ``` ```python for doc, score in docs_with_score: print(""-"" * 80) print(""Score: "", score) print(doc.page_content) print(""-"" * 80) ``` ## Working with vectorstore in Postgres ### Uploading a vectorstore in PG ```python db = PGEmbedding.from_documents( embedding=embeddings, documents=docs, collection_name=collection_name, connection_string=connection_string, pre_delete_collection=False, ) ``` ### Create HNSW Index By default, the extension performs a sequential scan search, with 100% recall. You might consider creating an HNSW index for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to speed up `similarity_search_with_score` execution time. To create the HNSW index on your vector column, use a `create_hnsw_index` function: ```python PGEmbedding.create_hnsw_index( max_elements=10000, dims=1536, m=8, ef_construction=16, ef_search=16 ) ``` The function above is equivalent to running the below SQL query: ```sql CREATE INDEX ON vectors USING hnsw(vec) WITH (maxelements=10000, dims=1536, m=3, efconstruction=16, efsearch=16); ``` The HNSW index options used in the statement above include: - maxelements: Defines the maximum number of elements indexed. This is a required parameter. The example shown above has a value of 3. A real-world example would have a much large value, such as 1000000. An ""element"" refers to a data point (a vector) in the dataset, which is represented as a node in the HNSW graph. Typically, you would set this option to a value able to accommodate the number of rows in your in your dataset. - dims: Defines the number of dimensions in your vector data. This is a required parameter. A small value is used in the example above. If you are storing data generated using OpenAI\'s text-embedding-ada-002 model, which supports 1536 dimensions, you would define a value of 1536, for example. - m: Defines the maximum number of bi-directional links (also referred to as ""edges"") created for each node during graph construction.

We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be: 1. _Data-aware_: connect a language model to other sources of data 2. _Agentic_: allow a language model to interact with its environment The LangChain framework is designed around these principles. This is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see [here]( For the JavaScript documentation, see [here]( ## Getting Started [\\#](\\#getting-started ""Permalink to this headline"") How to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application. - [Quickstart Guide]( Concepts and terminology. - [Concepts and terminology]( Tutorials created by community experts and presented on YouTube. - [Tutorials]( ## Modules [\\#](\\#modules ""Permalink to this headline"") These modules are the core abstractions which we view as the building blocks of any LLM-powered application. For each module LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces. LanghChain also provides external integrations and even end-to-end implementations for off-the-shelf use. The docs for each module contain quickstart examples, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides. The modules are (from least to most complex): - [Models]( Supported model types and integrations. - [Prompts]( Prompt management, optimization, and serialization. - [Memory]( Memory refers to state that is persisted between calls of a chain/agent. - [Indexes]( Language models become much more powerful when combined with application-specific data - this module contains interfaces and integrations for loading, querying and updating external data. - [Chains]( Chains are structured sequences of calls (to an LLM or to a different utility). - [Agents]( An agent is a Chain in which an LLM, given a high-level directive and a set of tools, repeatedly decides an action, executes the action and observes the outcome until the high-level directive is complete. - [Callbacks]( Callbacks let you log and stream the intermediate steps of any chain, making it easy to observe, debug, and evaluate the internals of an application. ## Use Cases [\\#](\\#use-cases ""Permalink to this headline"") Best practices and built-in implementations for common LangChain use cases: - [Autonomous Agents]( Autonomous agents are long-running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI. - [Agent Simulations]( Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other and react to events can be an effective way to evaluate their long-range reasoning and planning abilities. - [Personal Assistants]( One of the primary LangChain use cases. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data. - [Question Answering]( Another common LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer. - [Chatbots]( Language models love to chat, making this a very natural use of them. - [Querying Tabular Data]( Recommended reading if you want to use language models to query structured data (CSVs, SQL, dataframes, etc). - [Code Understanding]( Recommended reading if you want to use language models to analyze code. - [Interacting with APIs]( Enabling language models to interact with APIs is extremely powerful. It gives them access to up-to-date information and allows them to take actions. - [Extraction]( Extract structured information from text. - [Summarization]( Compressing longer documents. A type of Data-Augmented Generation. - [Evaluation]( Generative models are hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One promising approach is to use language models themselves to do the evaluation. ## Reference Docs [\\#](\\#reference-docs ""Permalink to this headline"") Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain. - [Reference Documentation]( ## LangChain Ecosystem [\\#](\\#langchain-ecosystem ""Permalink to this headline"") Guides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain. - [LangChain Ecosystem]( ## Additional Resources [\\#](\\#additional-resources ""Permalink to this headline"") Additional resources we think may be useful as you develop your application! - [LangChainHub]( The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents. - [Gallery]( A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications. - [Deployments]( A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps. - [Tracing]( A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents. - [Model Laboratory]( Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so. - [Discord]( Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain! - [YouTube]( A collection of the LangChain tutorials and videos. - [Production Support]( As you move your LangChains into production, we\'d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we\'ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel. ```', ""Tutorials | Tutorials Below are links to tutorials and courses on LangChain.

LangChain supports this in two ways: 1. Partial formatting with string values. 2. Partial formatting with functions that return string values. These two different ways support different use cases. In the examples below, we go over the motivations for both use cases as well as how to do it in LangChain. ## Partial with strings One common use case for wanting to partial a prompt template is if you get some of the variables before others. For example, suppose you have a prompt template that requires two variables, `foo` and `baz`. If you get the `foo` value early on in the chain, but the `baz` value later, it can be annoying to wait until you have both variables in the same place to pass them to the prompt template. Instead, you can partial the prompt template with the `foo` value, and then pass the partialed prompt template along and just use that. Below is an example of doing this: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` ```python prompt = PromptTemplate(template=""{foo}{bar}"", input_variables=[""foo"", ""bar""]) partial_prompt = prompt.partial(foo=""foo""); print(partial_prompt.format(bar=""baz"")) ``` ```text foobaz ``` You can also just initialize the prompt with the partialed variables. ```python prompt = PromptTemplate(template=""{foo}{bar}"", input_variables=[""bar""], partial_variables={""foo"": ""foo""}) print(prompt.format(bar=""baz"")) ``` ```text foobaz ``` ## Partial with functions The other common use is to partial with a function. The use case for this is when you have a variable you know that you always want to fetch in a common way. A prime example of this is with date or time. Imagine you have a prompt which you always want to have the current date. You can\'t hard code it in the prompt, and passing it along with the other input variables is a bit annoying. In this case, it\'s very handy to be able to partial the prompt with a function that always returns the current date. ```python from datetime import datetime def _get_datetime(): now = datetime.now() return now.strftime(""%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S"") ``` ```python prompt = PromptTemplate( template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}"", input_variables=[""adjective"", ""date""] ); partial_prompt = prompt.partial(date=_get_datetime) print(partial_prompt.format(adjective=""funny"")) ``` ```text Tell me a funny joke about the day 02/27/2023, 22:15:16 ``` You can also just initialize the prompt with the partialed variables, which often makes more sense in this workflow. ```python prompt = PromptTemplate( template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about the day {date}"", input_variables=[""adjective""], partial_variables={""date"": _get_datetime} ); print(prompt.format(adjective=""funny"")) ``` ```text Tell me a funny joke about the day 02/27/2023, 22:15:16 ``` - [Partial with strings](#partial-with-strings) - [Partial with functions](#partial-with-functions)', 'Dynamically route logic based on input | Dynamically route logic based on input This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language. Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`. Do not respond with more than one word. {question} Classification:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I call Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text \' Anthropic\' ``` Now, let\'s create three sub chains: ```python langchain_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in langchain. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Harrison Chase told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) anthropic_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in anthropic. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Dario Amodei told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) general_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch branch = RunnableBranch( (lambda x: ""anthropic"" in x[""topic""].lower(), anthropic_chain), (lambda x: ""langchain"" in x[""topic""].lower(), langchain_chain), general_chain, ) ``` ```python full_chain = {""topic"": chain, ""question"": lambda x: x[""question""]} | branch ``` ```python full_chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I use Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content="" As Dario Amodei told me, here are some ways to use Anthropic:\\n\\n- Sign up for an account on Anthropic\'s website to access tools like Claude, Constitutional AI, and Writer. \\n\\n- Use Claude for tasks like email generation, customer service chat, and QA.

These evaluators assess the full sequence of actions taken by an agent and their corresponding responses, which we refer to as the ""trajectory"". This allows you to better measure an agent\'s effectiveness and capabilities. A Trajectory Evaluator implements the `AgentTrajectoryEvaluator` interface, which requires two main methods: - `evaluate_agent_trajectory`: This method synchronously evaluates an agent\'s trajectory. - `aevaluate_agent_trajectory`: This asynchronous counterpart allows evaluations to be run in parallel for efficiency. Both methods accept three main parameters: - `input`: The initial input given to the agent. - `prediction`: The final predicted response from the agent. - `agent_trajectory`: The intermediate steps taken by the agent, given as a list of tuples. These methods return a dictionary. It is recommended that custom implementations return a `score` (a float indicating the effectiveness of the agent) and `reasoning` (a string explaining the reasoning behind the score). You can capture an agent\'s trajectory by initializing the agent with the `return_intermediate_steps=True` parameter. This lets you collect all intermediate steps without relying on special callbacks. For a deeper dive into the implementation and use of Trajectory Evaluators, refer to the sections below.

For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.\\nGetting Started\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\nGetting Started Documentation\\nModules\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for. For each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides. These modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\nModels: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\nUse Cases\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\nPersonal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\\nQuestion Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\nInteracting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\\nExtraction: Extract structured information from text.\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nReference Docs\\nAll of LangChain\'s reference documentation, in one place.

Does it omit urls?,"['Web scraping | Web scraping []( ## Use case [Web research]( is one of the killer LLM applications: - Users have [highlighted it]( as one of his top desired AI tools. - OSS repos like [gpt-researcher]( are growing in popularity. ![Image description](/assets/images/web_scraping-001e2279b9e46c696012ac26d7f218a2.png) ## Overview Gathering content from the web has a few components: - `Search`: Query to url (e.g., using `GoogleSearchAPIWrapper`). - `Loading`: Url to HTML (e.g., using `AsyncHtmlLoader`, `AsyncChromiumLoader`, etc). - `Transforming`: HTML to formatted text (e.g., using `HTML2Text` or `Beautiful Soup`). ## Quickstart ```python pip install -q openai langchain playwright beautifulsoup4 playwright install # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` Scraping HTML content using a headless instance of Chromium. - The async nature of the scraping process is handled using Python\'s asyncio library. - The actual interaction with the web pages is handled by Playwright. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import AsyncChromiumLoader from langchain.document_transformers import BeautifulSoupTransformer # Load HTML loader = AsyncChromiumLoader(["" html = loader.load() ``` Scrape text content tags such as `, , , and ` tags from the HTML content: - ``: The paragraph tag. It defines a paragraph in HTML and is used to group together related sentences and/or phrases. - ``: The list item tag. It is used within ordered (``) and unordered (``) lists to define individual items within the list. - ``: The division tag. It is a block-level element used to group other inline or block-level elements. - ``: The anchor tag. It is used to define hyperlinks. - ``: an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. For many news websites (e.g., WSJ, CNN), headlines and summaries are all in `` tags. ```python # Transform bs_transformer = BeautifulSoupTransformer() docs_transformed = bs_transformer.transform_documents(html, tags_to_extract=[""span""]) ``` ```python # Result docs_transformed[0].page_content[0:500] ``` ```text \'English EditionEnglish (Chinese) (Japanese) More Other Products from WSJBuy Side from WSJWSJ ShopWSJ Wine Other Products from WSJ Search Quotes and Companies Search Quotes and Companies 0.15% 0.03% 0.12% -0.42% 4.102% -0.69% -0.25% -0.15% -1.82% 0.24% 0.19% -1.10% About Evan His Family Reflects His Reporting How You Can Help Write a Message Life in Detention Latest News Get Email Updates Four Americans Released From Iranian Prison The Americans will remain under house arrest until they are \' ``` These `Documents` now are staged for downstream usage in various LLM apps, as discussed below. ## Loader ### AsyncHtmlLoader The [AsyncHtmlLoader](/docs/use_cases/docs/integrations/document_loaders/async_html) uses the `aiohttp` library to make asynchronous HTTP requests, suitable for simpler and lightweight scraping. ### AsyncChromiumLoader The [AsyncChromiumLoader](/docs/use_cases/docs/integrations/document_loaders/async_chromium) uses Playwright to launch a Chromium instance, which can handle JavaScript rendering and more complex web interactions. Chromium is one of the browsers supported by Playwright, a library used to control browser automation. Headless mode means that the browser is running without a graphical user interface, which is commonly used for web scraping. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import AsyncHtmlLoader urls = ["" "" loader = AsyncHtmlLoader(urls) docs = loader.load() ``` ## Transformer ### HTML2Text [HTML2Text](/docs/use_cases/docs/integrations/document_transformers/html2text) provides a straightforward conversion of HTML content into plain text (with markdown-like formatting) without any specific tag manipulation. It\'s best suited for scenarios where the goal is to extract human-readable text without needing to manipulate specific HTML elements. ### Beautiful Soup Beautiful Soup offers more fine-grained control over HTML content, enabling specific tag extraction, removal, and content cleaning. It\'s suited for cases where you want to extract specific information and clean up the HTML content according to your needs. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import AsyncHtmlLoader urls = ["" "" loader = AsyncHtmlLoader(urls) docs = loader.load() ``` ```text Fetching pages: 100%|#############################################################################################################| 2/2 [00:00<00:00, 7.01it/s] ``` ```python from langchain.document_transformers import Html2TextTransformer html2text = Html2TextTransformer() docs_transformed = html2text.transform_documents(docs) docs_transformed[0].page_content[0:500] ``` ```text ""Skip to main content Skip to navigation\\n\\n\\n\\nMenu\\n\\n## ESPN\\n\\n * Search\\n\\n * * scores\\n\\n * NFL\\n * MLB\\n * NBA\\n * NHL\\n * Soccer\\n * NCAAF\\n * \\n\\n * Women\'s World Cup\\n * LLWS\\n * NCAAM\\n * NCAAW\\n * Sports Betting\\n * Boxing\\n * CFL\\n * NCAA\\n * Cricket\\n * F1\\n * Golf\\n * Horse\\n * MMA\\n * NASCAR\\n * NBA G League\\n * Olympic Sports\\n * PLL\\n * Racing\\n * RN BB\\n * RN FB\\n * Rugby\\n * Tennis\\n * WNBA\\n * WWE\\n * X Games\\n * XFL\\n\\n * More"" ``` ## Scraping with extraction ### LLM with function calling Web scraping is challenging for many reasons. One of them is the changing nature of modern websites\' layouts and content, which requires modifying scraping scripts to accommodate the changes. Using Function (e.g., OpenAI) with an extraction chain, we avoid having to change your code constantly when websites change. We\'re using `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` to guarantee access to OpenAI Functions feature (although this might be available to everyone by time of writing). We\'re also keeping `temperature` at `0` to keep randomness of the LLM down. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"") ``` ### Define a schema Next, you define a schema to specify what kind of data you want to extract. Here, the key names matter as they tell the LLM what kind of information they want. So, be as detailed as possible. In this example, we want to scrape only news article\'s name and summary from The Wall Street Journal website. ```python from langchain.chains import create_extraction_chain schema = { ""properties"": { ""news_article_title"": {""type"": ""string""}, ""news_article_summary"": {""type"": ""string""}, }, ""required"": [""news_article_title"", ""news_article_summary""], } def extract(content: str, schema: dict): return create_extraction_chain(schema=schema, llm=llm).run(content) ``` ### Run the web scraper w/ BeautifulSoup As shown above, we\'ll be using `BeautifulSoupTransformer`. ```python import pprint from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter def scrape_with_playwright(urls, schema): loader = AsyncChromiumLoader(urls) docs = loader.load() bs_transformer = BeautifulSoupTransformer() docs_transformed = bs_transformer.transform_documents( docs, tags_to_extract=[""span""] ) print(""Extracting content with LLM"") # Grab the first 1000 tokens of the site splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0 ) splits = splitter.split_documents(docs_transformed) # Process the first split extracted_content = extract(schema=schema, content=splits[0].page_content) pprint.pprint(extracted_content) return extracted_content urls = ["" extracted_content = scrape_with_playwright(urls, schema=schema) ``` ```text

In the example below, we will deeply crawl the Python documentation of LangChain\'s Chat LLM models and answer a question over it. First, install the requirements `pip install apify-client openai langchain chromadb tiktoken` Next, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `APIFY_API_TOKEN` in your environment variables. The full code follows: ```python from langchain.docstore.document import Document from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator from langchain.utilities import ApifyWrapper apify = ApifyWrapper() # Call the Actor to obtain text from the crawled webpages loader = apify.call_actor( actor_id=""apify/website-content-crawler"", run_input={ ""startUrls"": [{""url"": "" }, dataset_mapping_function=lambda item: Document( page_content=item[""text""] or """", metadata={""source"": item[""url""]} ), ) # Create a vector store based on the crawled data index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader]) # Query the vector store query = ""Are any OpenAI chat models integrated in LangChain?"" result = index.query(query) print(result) ``` ```text Yes, LangChain offers integration with OpenAI chat models.

It allows you to verify if an LLM or Chain\'s output complies with a defined set of criteria. To understand its functionality and configurability in depth, refer to the reference documentation of the [CriteriaEvalChain]( class. ### Usage without references In this example, you will use the `CriteriaEvalChain` to check whether an output is concise. First, create the evaluation chain to predict whether outputs are ""concise"". ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", criteria=""conciseness"") # This is equivalent to loading using the enum from langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorType evaluator = load_evaluator(EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'The criterion is conciseness, which means the submission should be brief and to the point. \\n\\nLooking at the submission, the answer to the question ""What\\\'s 2+2?"" is indeed ""four"". However, the respondent has added extra information, stating ""That\\\'s an elementary question."" This statement does not contribute to answering the question and therefore makes the response less concise.\\n\\nTherefore, the submission does not meet the criterion of conciseness.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` #### Output Format All string evaluators expose an [evaluate_strings]( (or async [aevaluate_strings]( method, which accepts: - input (str) The input to the agent. - prediction (str) The predicted response. The criteria evaluators return a dictionary with the following values: - score: Binary integer 0 to 1, where 1 would mean that the output is compliant with the criteria, and 0 otherwise - value: A ""Y"" or ""N"" corresponding to the score - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Using Reference Labels Some criteria (such as correctness) require reference labels to work correctly. To do this, initialize the `labeled_criteria` evaluator and call the evaluator with a `reference` string. ```python evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"") # We can even override the model\'s learned knowledge using ground truth labels eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( input=""What is the capital of the US?"", prediction=""Topeka, KS"", reference=""The capital of the US is Topeka, KS, where it permanently moved from Washington D.C. on May 16, 2023"", ) print(f\'With ground truth: {eval_result[""score""]}\') ``` ```text With ground truth: 1 ``` **Default Criteria** Most of the time, you\'ll want to define your own custom criteria (see below), but we also provide some common criteria you can load with a single string. Here\'s a list of pre-implemented criteria. Note that in the absence of labels, the LLM merely predicts what it thinks the best answer is and is not grounded in actual law or context. ```python from langchain.evaluation import Criteria # For a list of other default supported criteria, try calling `supported_default_criteria` list(Criteria) ``` ```text [, , , , , , , , , , ] ``` ## Custom Criteria To evaluate outputs against your own custom criteria, or to be more explicit the definition of any of the default criteria, pass in a dictionary of `""criterion_name"": ""criterion_description""` Note: it\'s recommended that you create a single evaluator per criterion. This way, separate feedback can be provided for each aspect. Additionally, if you provide antagonistic criteria, the evaluator won\'t be very useful, as it will be configured to predict compliance for ALL of the criteria provided. ```python custom_criterion = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric or mathematical information?"" } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criterion, ) query = ""Tell me a joke"" prediction = ""I ate some square pie but I don\'t know the square of pi."" eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(eval_result) # If you wanted to specify multiple criteria. Generally not recommended custom_criteria = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric information?"", ""mathematical"": ""Does the output contain mathematical information?"", ""grammatical"": ""Is the output grammatically correct?"", ""logical"": ""Is the output logical?"", } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criteria, ) eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(""Multi-criteria evaluation"") print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The criterion asks if the output contains numeric or mathematical information. The joke in the submission does contain mathematical information. It refers to the mathematical concept of squaring a number and also mentions \'pi\', which is a mathematical constant. Therefore, the submission does meet the criterion.\\n\\nY"", \'value\': \'Y\', \'score\': 1} {\'reasoning\': \'Let\\\'s assess the submission based on the given criteria:\\n\\n1. Numeric: The output does not contain any explicit numeric information. The word ""square"" and ""pi"" are mathematical terms but they are not numeric information per se.\\n\\n2. Mathematical: The output does contain mathematical information. The terms ""square"" and ""pi"" are mathematical terms. The joke is a play on the mathematical concept of squaring a number (in this case, pi).\\n\\n3. Grammatical: The output is grammatically correct. The sentence structure, punctuation, and word usage are all correct.\\n\\n4. Logical: The output is logical. It makes sense within the context of the joke.

Below, use an anthropic model instead. ```python # %pip install ChatAnthropic # %env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", llm=llm, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Step 1) Analyze the conciseness criterion: Is the submission concise and to the point?\\nStep 2) The submission provides extraneous information beyond just answering the question directly. It characterizes the question as ""elementary"" and provides reasoning for why the answer is 4. This additional commentary makes the submission not fully concise.\\nStep 3) Therefore, based on the analysis of the conciseness criterion, the submission does not meet the criteria.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` # Configuring the Prompt If you want to completely customize the prompt, you can initialize the evaluator with a custom prompt template as follows. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate fstring = """"""Respond Y or N based on how well the following response follows the specified rubric. Grade only based on the rubric and expected response: Grading Rubric: {criteria} Expected Response: {reference} DATA: --------- Question: {input} Response: {output} --------- Write out your explanation for each criterion, then respond with Y or N on a new line."""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(fstring) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"", prompt=prompt) ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", reference=""It\'s 17 now."", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Correctness: No, the response is not correct. The expected response was ""It\\\'s 17 now."" but the response given was ""What\\\'s 2+2? That\\\'s an elementary question. The answer you\\\'re looking for is that two and two is four.""\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Conclusion In these examples, you used the `CriteriaEvalChain` to evaluate model outputs against custom criteria, including a custom rubric and constitutional principles. Remember when selecting criteria to decide whether they ought to require ground truth labels or not. Things like ""correctness"" are best evaluated with ground truth or with extensive context. Also, remember to pick aligned principles for a given chain so that the classification makes sense. - [Usage without references](#usage-without-references) - [Using Reference Labels](#using-reference-labels) - [Custom Criteria](#custom-criteria) - [Using Constitutional Principles](#using-constitutional-principles) - [Configuring the LLM](#configuring-the-llm) - [Conclusion](#conclusion)', 'Pairwise string comparison | Pairwise string comparison []( Often you will want to compare predictions of an LLM, Chain, or Agent for a given input.

The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `pairwise_string` evaluator. Check out the reference docs for the [PairwiseStringEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are relevant to the question asked, as they both provide a numerical answer to the question about the number of dogs in the park. However, Response A is incorrect according to the reference answer, which states that there are four dogs. Response B, on the other hand, is correct as it matches the reference answer. Neither response demonstrates depth of thought, as they both simply provide a numerical answer without any additional information or context. \\n\\nBased on these criteria, Response B is the better response.\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Methods The pairwise string evaluator can be called using [evaluate_string_pairs]( (or async [aevaluate_string_pairs]( methods, which accept: - prediction (str) The predicted response of the first model, chain, or prompt. - prediction_b (str) The predicted response of the second model, chain, or prompt. - input (str) The input question, prompt, or other text. - reference (str) (Only for the labeled_pairwise_string variant) The reference response. They return a dictionary with the following values: - value: \'A\' or \'B\', indicating whether `prediction` or `prediction_b` is preferred, respectively - score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the \'value\', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `prediction_b` is preferred. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Without References When references aren\'t available, you can still predict the preferred response. The results will reflect the evaluation model\'s preference, which is less reliable and may result in preferences that are factually incorrect. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Addition is a mathematical operation."", prediction_b=""Addition is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers to create a third number, the \'sum\'."", input=""What is addition?"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are correct and relevant to the question. However, Response B is more helpful and insightful as it provides a more detailed explanation of what addition is. Response A is correct but lacks depth as it does not explain what the operation of addition entails. \\n\\nFinal Decision: [[B]]\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Defining the Criteria By default, the LLM is instructed to select the \'preferred\' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms: - [Criteria]( enum or its string value - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions - [Constitutional principal]( - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain - Dictionary: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description. - A list of criteria or constitutional principles - to combine multiple criteria in one. Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style. ```python custom_criteria = { ""simplicity"": ""Is the language straightforward and unpretentious?"", ""clarity"": ""Are the sentences clear and easy to understand?"", ""precision"": ""Is the writing precise, with no unnecessary words or details?"", ""truthfulness"": ""Does the writing feel honest and sincere?"", ""subtext"": ""Does the writing suggest deeper meanings or themes?"", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"", criteria=custom_criteria) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Every cheerful household shares a similar rhythm of joy; but sorrow, in each household, plays a unique, haunting melody."", prediction_b=""Where one finds a symphony of joy, every domicile of happiness resounds in harmonious,"" "" identical notes; yet, every abode of despair conducts a dissonant orchestra, each"" "" playing an elegy of grief that is peculiar and profound to its own existence."", input=""Write some prose about families."", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Response A is simple, clear, and precise. It uses straightforward language to convey a deep and sincere message about families. The metaphor of joy and sorrow as music is effective and easy to understand.\\n\\nResponse B, on the other hand, is more complex and less clear. The language is more pretentious, with words like ""domicile,"" ""resounds,"" ""abode,"" ""dissonant,"" and ""elegy."" While it conveys a similar message to Response A, it does so in a more convoluted way. The precision is also lacking due to the use of unnecessary words and details.\\n\\nBoth responses suggest deeper meanings or themes about the shared joy and unique sorrow in families. However, Response A does so in a more effective and accessible way.\\n\\nTherefore, the better response is [[A]].\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` ## Customize the LLM By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain. You can customize this when loading. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"", llm=llm) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Here is my assessment:\\n\\nResponse B is more helpful, insightful, and accurate than Response A. Response B simply states ""4"", which directly answers the question by providing the exact number of dogs mentioned in the reference answer. In contrast, Response A states ""there are three dogs"", which is incorrect according to the reference answer. \\n\\nIn terms of helpfulness, Response B gives the precise number while Response A provides an inaccurate guess. For relevance, both refer to dogs in the park from the question. However, Response B is more correct and factual based on the reference answer. Response A shows some attempt at reasoning but is ultimately incorrect. Response B requires less depth of thought to simply state the factual number.\\n\\nIn summary, Response B is superior in terms of helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth. My final decision is: [[B]]\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Customize the Evaluation Prompt You can use your own custom evaluation prompt to add more task-specific instructions or to instruct the evaluator to score the output. *Note: If you use a prompt that expects generates a result in a unique format, you may also have to pass in a custom output parser (`output_parser=your_parser()`) instead of the default `PairwiseStringResultOutputParser` ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the input context, which do you prefer: A or B?

If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved. I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now. It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue it\'s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables.

I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+.

Thank you for your assistance, John Doe"""""" ``` ```python from langchain.schema import Document documents = [Document(page_content=document_content)] ``` We only have one document, so before we move on to creating a QA system, let\'s focus on its content to begin with. You may observe that the text contains many different PII values, some types occur repeatedly (names, phone numbers, emails), and some specific PIIs are repeated (John Doe). ```python # Util function for coloring the PII markers # NOTE: It will not be visible on documentation page, only in the notebook import re def print_colored_pii(string): colored_string = re.sub( r""(]*>)"", lambda m: ""\\033[31m"" + m.group(1) + ""\\033[0m"", string ) print(colored_string) ``` Let\'s proceed and try to anonymize the text with the default settings. For now, we don\'t replace the data with synthetic, we just mark it with markers (e.g. ``), so we set `add_default_faker_operators=False`: ```python from langchain_experimental.data_anonymizer import PresidioReversibleAnonymizer anonymizer = PresidioReversibleAnonymizer( add_default_faker_operators=False, ) print_colored_pii(anonymizer.anonymize(document_content)) ``` ```text Date: Witness: Subject: Testimony Regarding the Loss of Wallet Testimony Content: Hello Officer, My name is and on , my wallet was stolen in the vicinity of during a bike trip.

Thank you for your assistance, ``` Let\'s also look at the mapping between original and anonymized values: ```python import pprint pprint.pprint(anonymizer.deanonymizer_mapping) ``` ```text {\'CREDIT_CARD\': {\'\': \'4111 1111 1111 1111\'}, \'DATE_TIME\': {\'\': \'October 19, 2021\', \'\': \'9:30 AM\'}, \'EMAIL_ADDRESS\': {\'\': \'johndoe@example.com\', \'\': \'support@bankname.com\'}, \'IBAN_CODE\': {\'\': \'PL61109010140000071219812874\'}, \'LOCATION\': {\'\': \'Kilmarnock\'}, \'PERSON\': {\'\': \'John Doe\', \'\': \'Victoria Cherry\'}, \'PHONE_NUMBER\': {\'\': \'999-888-7777\'}, \'UK_NHS\': {\'\': \'987-654-3210\'}, \'US_DRIVER_LICENSE\': {\'\': \'999000680\'}, \'US_SSN\': {\'\': \'602-76-4532\'}} ``` In general, the anonymizer works pretty well, but I can observe two things to improve here: 1. Datetime redundancy - we have two different entities recognized as `DATE_TIME`, but they contain different type of information. The first one is a date (_October 19, 2021_), the second one is a time (_9:30 AM_). We can improve this by adding a new recognizer to the anonymizer, which will treat time separately from the date. 2. Polish ID - polish ID has unique pattern, which is not by default part of anonymizer recognizers. The value _ABC123456_ is not anonymized. The solution is simple: we need to add a new recognizers to the anonymizer. You can read more about it in [presidio documentation]( Let\'s add new recognizers: ```python # Define the regex pattern in a Presidio `Pattern` object: from presidio_analyzer import Pattern, PatternRecognizer polish_id_pattern = Pattern( name=""polish_id_pattern"", regex=""[A-Z]{3}\\d{6}"", score=1, ) time_pattern = Pattern( name=""time_pattern"", regex=""(1[0-2]|0?[1-9]):[0-5][0-9] (AM|PM)"", score=1, ) # Define the recognizer with one or more patterns polish_id_recognizer = PatternRecognizer( supported_entity=""POLISH_ID"", patterns=[polish_id_pattern] ) time_recognizer = PatternRecognizer(supported_entity=""TIME"", patterns=[time_pattern]) ``` And now, we\'re adding recognizers to our anonymizer: ```python anonymizer.add_recognizer(polish_id_recognizer) anonymizer.add_recognizer(time_recognizer) ``` Note that our anonymization instance remembers previously detected and anonymized values, including those that were not detected correctly (e.g., _""9:30 AM""_ taken as `DATE_TIME`). So it\'s worth removing this value, or resetting the entire mapping now that our recognizers have been updated: ```python anonymizer.reset_deanonymizer_mapping() ``` Let\'s anonymize the text and see the results: ```python print_colored_pii(anonymizer.anonymize(document_content)) ``` ```text Date: Witness: Subject: Testimony Regarding the Loss of Wallet Testimony Content: Hello Officer, My name is and on , my wallet was stolen in the vicinity of during a bike trip.

The anonymizer has replaced the time and Polish ID entities with the `` and `` markers, and the deanonymizer mapping has been updated accordingly. Now, when all PII values are detected correctly, we can proceed to the next step, which is replacing the original values with synthetic ones. To do this, we need to set `add_default_faker_operators=True` (or just remove this parameter, because it\'s set to `True` by default): ```python anonymizer = PresidioReversibleAnonymizer( add_default_faker_operators=True, # Faker seed is used here to make sure the same fake data is generated for the test purposes # In production, it is recommended to remove the faker_seed parameter (it will default to None) faker_seed=42, ) anonymizer.add_recognizer(polish_id_recognizer) anonymizer.add_recognizer(time_recognizer) print_colored_pii(anonymizer.anonymize(document_content)) ``` ```text Date: 1986-04-18 Witness: Brian Cox DVM Subject: Testimony Regarding the Loss of Wallet Testimony Content: Hello Officer, My name is Brian Cox DVM and on 1986-04-18, my wallet was stolen in the vicinity of New Rita during a bike trip.

The only exception is the Polish ID number and time, which are not supported by the default faker operators. We can add new operators to the anonymizer, which will generate random data.

Here's a brief example:

```python
from weaviate import Client

# Initialize the Weaviate client
client = Client(""http://localhost:8080"")

# Define your query
query = {
    ""query"": ""Your Query Here""
}

# Execute the query
results = client.query.get(""YourClass"", [""property1"", ""property2""]).with_query(query).do()

# Get the source objects
source_objects = client.batch.get_source_objects(results)

# Print the source objects
for source in source_objects:
    print(source)
```

Replace `""Your Query Here""` and `""YourClass""` with your actual query and class name. This will print the source documents related to the query results.","To retrieve the source documents from your Weaviate vectorstore, you need to configure your client to include the 'sources' attribute. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```python
weaviate_client = Weaviate(

    index_name='index_name',
    text_key='text',
    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    by_text=False,
    attributes=['source'],
)
```

By including the 'source' attribute in the attributes list, you ensure that the source documents are returned when you interact with the Weaviate client.",0.99999999995,0.0,,0.120893074883724,0.2905027932960894

Thanks to LangChain having a standardized `VectorStore` interface, most of the ""Astra DB"" section above applies to this case as well. However, this time the database uses the CQL protocol, which means you\'ll use a _different_ class this time and instantiate it in another way. The cells below show how you should get your `vstore` object in this case and how you can clean up the database resources at the end: for the rest, i.e. the actual usage of the vector store, you will be able to run the very code that was shown above. In other words, running this demo in full with Cassandra or Astra DB through CQL means: - **initialization as shown below** - ""Load a dataset"", _see above section_ - ""Run simple searches"", _see above section_ - ""MMR search"", _see above section_ - ""Deleting stored documents"", _see above section_ - ""A minimal RAG chain"", _see above section_ - **cleanup as shown below** ### Initialization The class to use is the following: ```python from langchain.vectorstores import Cassandra ``` Now, depending on whether you connect to a Cassandra cluster or to Astra DB through CQL, you will provide different parameters when creating the vector store object. #### Initialization (Cassandra cluster) In this case, you first need to create a `cassandra.cluster.Session` object, as described in the [Cassandra driver documentation]( The details vary (e.g. with network settings and authentication), but this might be something like: ```python from cassandra.cluster import Cluster cluster = Cluster([""127.0.0.1""]) session = cluster.connect() ``` You can now set the session, along with your desired keyspace name, as a global CassIO parameter: ```python import cassio CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE = input(""CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE = "") cassio.init(session=session, keyspace=CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE) ``` Now you can create the vector store: ```python vstore = Cassandra( embedding=embe, table_name=""cassandra_vector_demo"", # session=None, keyspace=None # Uncomment on older versions of LangChain ) ``` #### Initialization (Astra DB through CQL) In this case you initialize CassIO with the following connection parameters: - the Database ID, e.g. `01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef` - the Token, e.g. `AstraCS:6gBhNmsk135....` (it must be a ""Database Administrator"" token) - Optionally a Keyspace name (if omitted, the default one for the database will be used) ```python ASTRA_DB_ID = input(""ASTRA_DB_ID = "") ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN = getpass(""ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN = "") desired_keyspace = input(""ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE (optional, can be left empty) = "") if desired_keyspace: ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE = desired_keyspace else: ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE = None ``` ```python import cassio cassio.init( database_id=ASTRA_DB_ID, token=ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN, keyspace=ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE, ) ``` Now you can create the vector store: ```python vstore = Cassandra( embedding=embe, table_name=""cassandra_vector_demo"", # session=None, keyspace=None # Uncomment on older versions of LangChain ) ``` ### Usage of the vector store _See the sections ""Load a dataset"" through ""A minimal RAG chain"" above._ Speaking of the latter, you can check out a full RAG template for Astra DB through CQL [here]( ### Cleanup the following essentially retrieves the `Session` object from CassIO and runs a CQL `DROP TABLE` statement with it: ```python cassio.config.resolve_session().execute( f""DROP TABLE {cassio.config.resolve_keyspace()}.cassandra_vector_demo;"" ) ``` ### Learn more For more information, extended quickstarts and additional usage examples, please visit the [CassIO documentation]( for more on using the LangChain `Cassandra` vector store. - [Setup and general dependencies](#setup-and-general-dependencies) - [Astra DB](#astra-db-1)- [Astra DB connection parameters](#astra-db-connection-parameters) - [Load a dataset](#load-a-dataset) - [Run simple searches](#run-simple-searches) - [MMR (Maximal-marginal-relevance) search](#mmr-maximal-marginal-relevance-search) - [Deleting stored documents](#deleting-stored-documents) - [A minimal RAG chain](#a-minimal-rag-chain) - [Cleanup](#cleanup) - [Apache Cassandra and Astra DB through CQL](#apache-cassandra-and-astra-db-through-cql)- [Initialization](#initialization) - [Usage of the vector store](#usage-of-the-vector-store) - [Cleanup](#cleanup-1) - [Learn more](#learn-more)', 'Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) | Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) []( ## Overview ### What is RAG? RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer: ``` We\'ll use the [LCEL Runnable]( protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box ```python from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python for chunk in rag_chain.stream(""What is Task Decomposition?""): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Task decomposition can be performed by AI models with prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ### Go deeper #### Choosing LLMs `ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model wrapper.

We can build a ""condense question"" chain that looks something like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder condense_q_system_prompt = """"""Given a chat history and the latest user question \\ which might reference the chat history, formulate a standalone question \\ which can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \\ just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."""""" condense_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", condense_q_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) condense_q_chain = condense_q_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""What is meant by large"", } ) ``` ```text \'What is the definition of ""large"" in the context of a language model?\' ``` ```python condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""How do transformers work"", } ) ``` ```text \'How do transformer models function?\' ``` And now we can build our full QA chain. Notice we add some routing functionality to only run the ""condense question chain"" when our chat history isn\'t empty. ```python qa_system_prompt = """"""You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \\ Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. \\ If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. \\ Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\ {context}"""""" qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", qa_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) def condense_question(input: dict): if input.get(""chat_history""): return condense_q_chain else: return input[""question""] rag_chain = ( RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=condense_question | retriever | format_docs) | qa_prompt | llm ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] question = ""What is Task Decomposition?"" ai_msg = rag_chain.invoke({""question"": question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=question), ai_msg]) second_question = ""What are common ways of doing it?"" rag_chain.invoke({""question"": second_question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'Common ways of task decomposition include:\\n\\n1.

Prompting with LLM: Language Model (LLM) can be used to prompt the model with simple instructions like ""Steps for XYZ"" or ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"" This allows the model to generate a sequence of subtasks or thought steps.\\n\\n3. Task-specific instructions: For certain tasks, task-specific instructions can be provided to guide the model in decomposing the task. For example, for writing a novel, the instruction ""Write a story outline"" can be given to break down the task into manageable steps.\\n\\n4. Human inputs: In some cases, human inputs can be used to assist in task decomposition. Humans can provide their expertise and knowledge to identify and break down complex tasks into smaller subtasks.\') ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( Here we\'ve gone over how to add chain logic for incorporating historical outputs.

There\'s plenty of nuances, features, integrations, etc to explore in each of the above sections. Aside from the sources mentioned above, good next steps include: - Reading up on more advanced retrieval techniques in the [Retrievers](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/) section. - Learning about the LangChain [Indexing API](/docs/modules/data_connection/indexing), which helps repeatedly sync data sources and vector stores without redundant computation or storage. - Exploring RAG [LangChain Templates](/docs/templates/#-advanced-retrieval), which are reference applications that can easily be deployed with [LangServe](/docs/langserve). - Learning about [evaluating RAG applications with LangSmith]( - [Overview](#overview)- [What is RAG?](#what-is-rag) - [What\'s in this guide?](#whats-in-this-guide) - [Architecture](#architecture) - [Setup](#setup)- [Dependencies](#dependencies) - [LangSmith](#langsmith) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Detailed walkthrough](#detailed-walkthrough) - [Step 1.

It uses [PGVector]( extension as shown in the [RAG empowered SQL cookbook](/docs/templates/cookbook/retrieval_in_sql.ipynb) ## Environment Setup If you are using `ChatOpenAI` as your LLM, make sure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your environment. You can change both the LLM and embeddings model inside `chain.py` And you can configure configure the following environment variables for use by the template (defaults are in parentheses) - `POSTGRES_USER` (postgres) - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (test) - `POSTGRES_DB` (vectordb) - `POSTGRES_HOST` (localhost) - `POSTGRES_PORT` (5432) If you don\'t have a postgres instance, you can run one locally in docker: ```bash docker run \\ --name some-postgres \\ -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test \\ -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \\ -e POSTGRES_DB=vectordb \\ -p 5432:5432 \\ postgres:16 ``` And to start again later, use the `--name` defined above: ```bash docker start some-postgres ``` ### PostgreSQL Database setup Apart from having `pgvector` extension enabled, you will need to do some setup before being able to run semantic search within your SQL queries. In order to run RAG over your postgreSQL database you will need to generate the embeddings for the specific columns you want. This process is covered in the [RAG empowered SQL cookbook](/docs/templates/cookbook/retrieval_in_sql.ipynb), but the overall approach consist of: 1. Querying for unique values in the column 2. Generating embeddings for those values 3. Store the embeddings in a separate column or in an auxiliary table. ## Usage To use this package, you should first have the LangChain CLI installed: ```shell pip install -U langchain-cli ``` To create a new LangChain project and install this as the only package, you can do: ```shell langchain app new my-app --package sql-pgvector ``` If you want to add this to an existing project, you can just run: ```shell langchain app add sql-pgvector ``` And add the following code to your `server.py` file: ```python from sql_pgvector import chain as sql_pgvector_chain add_routes(app, sql_pgvector_chain, path=""/sql-pgvector"") ``` (Optional) Let\'s now configure LangSmith. LangSmith will help us trace, monitor and debug LangChain applications.

44,How do i run lcel in java,"['Prompt templates | Prompt templates Prompt templates are pre-defined recipes for generating prompts for language models. A template may include instructions, few-shot examples, and specific context and questions appropriate for a given task. LangChain provides tooling to create and work with prompt templates. LangChain strives to create model agnostic templates to make it easy to reuse existing templates across different language models. Typically, language models expect the prompt to either be a string or else a list of chat messages. ## PromptTemplate Use `PromptTemplate` to create a template for a string prompt. By default, `PromptTemplate` uses [Python\'s str.format]( syntax for templating. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."" ) prompt_template.format(adjective=""funny"", content=""chickens"") ``` ```text \'Tell me a funny joke about chickens.\' ``` The template supports any number of variables, including no variables: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke"") prompt_template.format() ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke\' ``` For additional validation, specify `input_variables` explicitly. These variables will be compared against the variables present in the template string during instantiation, **raising an exception if there is a mismatch**. For example: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate invalid_prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""adjective""], template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."", ) ``` ```text --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ValidationError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[19], line 3 1 from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ----> 3 invalid_prompt = PromptTemplate( 4 input_variables=[""adjective""], 5 template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."" 6 ) File ~/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/load/serializable.py:97, in Serializable.__init__(self, **kwargs) 96 def __init__(self, **kwargs: Any) -> None: ---> 97 super().__init__(**kwargs) 98 self._lc_kwargs = kwargs File ~/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pydantic/main.py:341, in pydantic.main.BaseModel.__init__() ValidationError: 1 validation error for PromptTemplate __root__ Invalid prompt schema; check for mismatched or missing input parameters. \'content\' (type=value_error) ``` You can create custom prompt templates that format the prompt in any way you want. For more information, see [Custom Prompt Templates](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/custom_prompt_template.html). ## ChatPromptTemplate The prompt to [chat models](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/models/chat) is a list of chat messages. Each chat message is associated with content, and an additional parameter called `role`. For example, in the OpenAI [Chat Completions API]( a chat message can be associated with an AI assistant, a human or a system role. Create a chat prompt template like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a helpful AI bot. Your name is {name}.""), (""human"", ""Hello, how are you doing?""), (""ai"", ""I\'m doing well, thanks!""), (""human"", ""{user_input}""), ] ) messages = chat_template.format_messages(name=""Bob"", user_input=""What is your name?"") ``` `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages` accepts a variety of message representations. For example, in addition to using the 2-tuple representation of (type, content) used above, you could pass in an instance of `MessagePromptTemplate` or `BaseMessage`. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import HumanMessagePromptTemplate from langchain.schema.messages import SystemMessage chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=( ""You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to "" ""sound more upbeat."" ) ), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{text}""), ] ) llm = ChatOpenAI() llm(chat_template.format_messages(text=""i dont like eating tasty things."")) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'I absolutely love indulging in delicious treats!\') ``` This provides you with a lot of flexibility in how you construct your chat prompts. ## LCEL `PromptTemplate` and `ChatPromptTemplate` implement the [Runnable interface](/docs/expression_language/interface), the basic building block of the [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/expression_language/). This means they support `invoke`, `ainvoke`, `stream`, `astream`, `batch`, `abatch`, `astream_log` calls. `PromptTemplate` accepts a dictionary (of the prompt variables) and returns a `StringPromptValue`. A `ChatPromptTemplate` accepts a dictionary and returns a `ChatPromptValue`. ```python prompt_val = prompt_template.invoke({""adjective"": ""funny"", ""content"": ""chickens""}) prompt_val ``` ```text StringPromptValue(text=\'Tell me a joke\') ``` ```python prompt_val.to_string() ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke\' ``` ```python prompt_val.to_messages() ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=\'Tell me a joke\')] ``` ```python chat_val = chat_template.invoke({""text"": ""i dont like eating tasty things.""}) ``` ```python chat_val.to_messages() ``` ```text [SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to sound more upbeat.""), HumanMessage(content=\'i dont like eating tasty things.\')] ``` ```python chat_val.to_string() ``` ```text ""System: You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to sound more upbeat.\\nHuman: i dont like eating tasty things."" ``` - [PromptTemplate](#prompttemplate) - [ChatPromptTemplate](#chatprompttemplate) - [LCEL](#lcel)', 'Prompt pipelining | Prompt pipelining The idea behind prompt pipelining is to provide a user friendly interface for composing different parts of prompts together. You can do this with either string prompts or chat prompts. Constructing prompts this way allows for easy reuse of components. ## String prompt pipelining When working with string prompts, each template is joined together. You can work with either prompts directly or strings (the first element in the list needs to be a prompt). ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` ```python prompt = ( PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") + "", make it funny"" + ""\\n\\nand in {language}"" ) ``` ```python prompt ``` ```text PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'language\', \'topic\'], output_parser=None, partial_variables={}, template=\'Tell me a joke about {topic}, make it funny\\n\\nand in {language}\', template_format=\'f-string\', validate_template=True) ``` ```python prompt.format(topic=""sports"", language=""spanish"") ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke about sports, make it funny\\n\\nand in spanish\' ``` You can also use it in an LLMChain, just like before. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=prompt) ``` ```python chain.run(topic=""sports"", language=""spanish"") ``` ```text \'Por qu el futbolista llevaba un paraguas al partido?\\n\\nPorque pronosticaban lluvia de goles.\' ``` ## Chat prompt pipelining A chat prompt is made up a of a list of messages. Purely for developer experience, we\'ve added a convinient way to create these prompts. In this pipeline, each new element is a new message in the final prompt. ```python from langchain.schema import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage ``` First, let\'s initialize the base ChatPromptTemplate with a system message. It doesn\'t have to start with a system, but it\'s often good practice ```python prompt = SystemMessage(content=""You are a nice pirate"") ``` You can then easily create a pipeline combining it with other messages _or_ message templates. Use a `Message` when there is no variables to be formatted, use a `MessageTemplate` when there are variables to be formatted. You can also use just a string (note: this will automatically get inferred as a HumanMessagePromptTemplate.) ```python new_prompt = ( prompt + HumanMessage(content=""hi"") + AIMessage(content=""what?"") + ""{input}"" ) ``` Under the hood, this creates an instance of the ChatPromptTemplate class, so you can use it just as you did before! ```python new_prompt.format_messages(input=""i said hi"") ``` ```text [SystemMessage(content=\'You are a nice pirate\', additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessage(content=\'hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'what?\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=\'i said hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)] ``` You can also use it in an LLMChain, just like before. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=new_prompt) ``` ```python chain.run(""i said hi"") ``` ```text \'Oh, hello! How can I assist you today?\' ``` - [String prompt pipelining](#string-prompt-pipelining) - [Chat prompt pipelining](#chat-prompt-pipelining)', 'Chains | Chains Using an LLM in isolation is fine for simple applications, but more complex applications require chaining LLMs - either with each other or with other components. LangChain provides two high-level frameworks for ""chaining"" components. The legacy approach is to use the `Chain` interface. The updated approach is to use the [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/expression_language/). When building new applications we recommend using LCEL for chain composition. But there are a number of useful, built-in `Chain`\'s that we continue to support, so we document both frameworks here. As we\'ll touch on below, `Chain`\'s can also themselves be used in LCEL, so the two are not mutually exclusive. ## LCEL The most visible part of LCEL is that it provides an intuitive and readable syntax for composition. But more importantly, it also provides first-class support for: - [streaming](/docs/expression_language/interface#stream), - [async calls](/docs/expression_language/interface#async-stream), - [batching](/docs/expression_language/interface#batch), - [parallelization](/docs/expression_language/interface#parallelism), - retries, - [fallbacks](/docs/expression_language/how_to/fallbacks), - tracing, - [and more.](/docs/expression_language/why) As a simple and common example, we can see what it\'s like to combine a prompt, model and output parser: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser model = ChatAnthropic() prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a very knowledgeable historian who provides accurate and eloquent answers to historical questions."", ), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) runnable = prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python for chunk in runnable.stream({""question"": ""How did Mansa Musa accumulate his wealth?""}): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Mansa Musa was the emperor of the Mali Empire in West Africa during the 14th century. He accumulated immense wealth through several means: - Gold mining - Mali contained very rich gold deposits, especially in the region of Bambuk. Gold mining and gold trade was a major source of wealth for the empire. - Control of trade routes - Mali dominated the trans-Saharan trade routes connecting West Africa to North Africa and beyond. By taxing the goods that passed through its territory, Mali profited greatly. - Tributary states - Many lands surrounding Mali paid tribute to the empire. This came in the form of gold, slaves, and other valuable resources. - Agriculture - Mali also had extensive agricultural lands irrigated by the Niger River. Surplus food produced could be sold or traded. - Royal monopolies - The emperor claimed monopoly rights over the production and sale of certain goods like salt from the Taghaza mines. This added to his personal wealth. - Inheritance - As an emperor, Mansa Musa inherited a wealthy state. His predecessors had already consolidated lands and accumulated riches which fell to Musa. So in summary, mining, trade, taxes, ``` For more head to the [LCEL section](/docs/expression_language/). ## [Legacy] Chain interface **Chain**\'s are the legacy interface for ""chained"" applications. We define a Chain very generically as a sequence of calls to components, which can include other chains. The base interface is simple: ```python class Chain(BaseModel, ABC): """"""Base interface that all chains should implement."""""" memory: BaseMemory callbacks: Callbacks def __call__( self, inputs: Any, return_only_outputs: bool = False, callbacks: Callbacks = None, ) -> Dict[str, Any]: ... ``` We can recreate the LCEL runnable we made above using the built-in `LLMChain`: ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=prompt, output_parser=StrOutputParser()) chain.run(question=""How did Mansa Musa accumulate his wealth?"") ``` ```text "" Mansa Musa was the emperor of the Mali Empire in West Africa in the early 14th century.

However, delivering LLM applications to production can be deceptively difficult. You will likely have to heavily customize and iterate on your prompts, chains, and other components to create a high-quality product. To aid in this process, we\'ve launched LangSmith, a unified platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring your LLM applications. When might this come in handy? You may find it useful when you want to: - Quickly debug a new chain, agent, or set of tools - Visualize how components (chains, llms, retrievers, etc.) relate and are used - Evaluate different prompts and LLMs for a single component - Run a given chain several times over a dataset to ensure it consistently meets a quality bar - Capture usage traces and using LLMs or analytics pipelines to generate insights ## Prerequisites **Create a LangSmith account and create an API key (see bottom left corner). Familiarize yourself with the platform by looking through the docs** Note LangSmith is in closed beta; we\'re in the process of rolling it out to more users. However, you can fill out the form on the website for expedited access. Now, let\'s get started! ## Log runs to LangSmith First, configure your environment variables to tell LangChain to log traces. This is done by setting the `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2` environment variable to true. You can tell LangChain which project to log to by setting the `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT` environment variable (if this isn\'t set, runs will be logged to the `default` project). This will automatically create the project for you if it doesn\'t exist. You must also set the `LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT` and `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` environment variables. For more information on other ways to set up tracing, please reference the [LangSmith documentation]( **NOTE:** You must also set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables in order to run the following tutorial. **NOTE:** You can only access an API key when you first create it. Keep it somewhere safe. **NOTE:** You can also use a context manager in python to log traces using ```python from langchain.callbacks.manager import tracing_v2_enabled with tracing_v2_enabled(project_name=""My Project""): agent.run(""How many people live in canada as of 2023?"") ``` However, in this example, we will use environment variables. ```python %pip install openai tiktoken pandas duckduckgo-search --quiet ``` ```python import os from uuid import uuid4 unique_id = uuid4().hex[0:8] os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_PROJECT""] = f""Tracing Walkthrough - {unique_id}"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT""] = "" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = """" # Update to your API key # Used by the agent in this tutorial os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = """" ``` Create the langsmith client to interact with the API ```python from langsmith import Client client = Client() ``` Create a LangChain component and log runs to the platform. In this example, we will create a ReAct-style agent with access to a general search tool (DuckDuckGo). The agent\'s prompt can be viewed in the [Hub here]( ```python from langchain import hub from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.agents.output_parsers import OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchResults from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function # Fetches the latest version of this prompt prompt = hub.pull(""wfh/langsmith-agent-prompt:latest"") llm = ChatOpenAI( model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"", temperature=0, ) tools = [ DuckDuckGoSearchResults( name=""duck_duck_go"" ), # General internet search using DuckDuckGo ] llm_with_tools = llm.bind(functions=[format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools]) runnable_agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) agent_executor = AgentExecutor( agent=runnable_agent, tools=tools, handle_parsing_errors=True ) ``` We are running the agent concurrently on multiple inputs to reduce latency. Runs get logged to LangSmith in the background so execution latency is unaffected. ```python inputs = [ ""What is LangChain?"", ""What\'s LangSmith?"", ""When was Llama-v2 released?"", ""What is the langsmith cookbook?"", ""When did langchain first announce the hub?"", ] results = agent_executor.batch([{""input"": x} for x in inputs], return_exceptions=True) ``` ```python results[:2] ``` ```text [{\'input\': \'What is LangChain?\', \'output\': \'I\\\'m sorry, but I couldn\\\'t find any information about ""LangChain"".

It could be a specific term or a company that is not widely known. Can you provide more context or clarify what you are referring to?\'}] ``` Assuming you\'ve successfully set up your environment, your agent traces should show up in the `Projects` section in the [app]( Congrats! ![Initial Runs](/assets/images/log_traces-edd14f0c4d5c320263362395793babdc.png) It looks like the agent isn\'t effectively using the tools though. Let\'s evaluate this so we have a baseline. ## Evaluate Agent In addition to logging runs, LangSmith also allows you to test and evaluate your LLM applications. In this section, you will leverage LangSmith to create a benchmark dataset and run AI-assisted evaluators on an agent. You will do so in a few steps: 1. Create a dataset 2. Initialize a new agent to benchmark 3. Configure evaluators to grade an agent\'s output 4. Run the agent over the dataset and evaluate the results ### 1. Create a LangSmith dataset Below, we use the LangSmith client to create a dataset from the input questions from above and a list labels. You will use these later to measure performance for a new agent. A dataset is a collection of examples, which are nothing more than input-output pairs you can use as test cases to your application. For more information on datasets, including how to create them from CSVs or other files or how to create them in the platform, please refer to the [LangSmith documentation]( ```python outputs = [ ""LangChain is an open-source framework for building applications using large language models. It is also the name of the company building LangSmith."", ""LangSmith is a unified platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring language model applications and agents powered by LangChain"", ""July 18, 2023"", ""The langsmith cookbook is a github repository containing detailed examples of how to use LangSmith to debug, evaluate, and monitor large language model-powered applications."", ""September 5, 2023"", ] ``` ```python dataset_name = f""agent-qa-{unique_id}"" dataset = client.create_dataset( dataset_name, description=""An example dataset of questions over the LangSmith documentation."", ) for query, answer in zip(inputs, outputs): client.create_example( inputs={""input"": query}, outputs={""output"": answer}, dataset_id=dataset.id ) ``` ### 2. Initialize a new agent to benchmark LangSmith lets you evaluate any LLM, chain, agent, or even a custom function. Conversational agents are stateful (they have memory); to ensure that this state isn\'t shared between dataset runs, we will pass in a `chain_factory` (aka a `constructor`) function to initialize for each call. In this case, we will test an agent that uses OpenAI\'s function calling endpoints. ```python from langchain import hub from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_to_openai_function_messages from langchain.agents.output_parsers import OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools.render import format_tool_to_openai_function # Since chains can be stateful (e.g. they can have memory), we provide # a way to initialize a new chain for each row in the dataset. This is done # by passing in a factory function that returns a new chain for each row. def agent_factory(prompt): llm_with_tools = llm.bind( functions=[format_tool_to_openai_function(t) for t in tools] ) runnable_agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_to_openai_function_messages( x[""intermediate_steps""] ), } | prompt | llm_with_tools | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() ) return AgentExecutor(agent=runnable_agent, tools=tools, handle_parsing_errors=True) ``` ### 3. Configure evaluation Manually comparing the results of chains in the UI is effective, but it can be time consuming. It can be helpful to use automated metrics and AI-assisted feedback to evaluate your component\'s performance. Below, we will create some pre-implemented run evaluators that do the following: - Compare results against ground truth labels. - Measure semantic (dis)similarity using embedding distance - Evaluate \'aspects\' of the agent\'s response in a reference-free manner using custom criteria For a longer discussion of how to select an appropriate evaluator for your use case and how to create your own custom evaluators, please refer to the [LangSmith documentation]( ```python from langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorType from langchain.smith import RunEvalConfig evaluation_config = RunEvalConfig( # Evaluators can either be an evaluator type (e.g., ""qa"", ""criteria"", ""embedding_distance"", etc.) or a configuration for that evaluator evaluators=[ # Measures whether a QA response is ""Correct"", based on a reference answer # You can also select via the raw string ""qa"" EvaluatorType.QA, # Measure the embedding distance between the output and the reference answer # Equivalent to: EvalConfig.EmbeddingDistance(embeddings=OpenAIEmbeddings()) EvaluatorType.EMBEDDING_DISTANCE, # Grade whether the output satisfies the stated criteria. # You can select a default one such as ""helpfulness"" or provide your own. RunEvalConfig.LabeledCriteria(""helpfulness""), # The LabeledScoreString evaluator outputs a score on a scale from 1-10. # You can use default criteria or write our own rubric RunEvalConfig.LabeledScoreString( { ""accuracy"": """""" Score 1: The answer is completely unrelated to the reference. Score 3: The answer has minor relevance but does not align with the reference. Score 5: The answer has moderate relevance but contains inaccuracies. Score 7: The answer aligns with the reference but has minor errors or omissions. Score 10: The answer is completely accurate and aligns perfectly with the reference."""""" }, normalize_by=10, ), ], # You can add custom StringEvaluator or RunEvaluator objects here as well, which will automatically be # applied to each prediction. Check out the docs for examples. custom_evaluators=[], ) ``` ### 4. Run the agent and evaluators Use the [run_on_dataset]( (or asynchronous [arun_on_dataset]( function to evaluate your model. This will: 1. Fetch example rows from the specified dataset. 2. Run your agent (or any custom function) on each example. 3. Apply evaluators to the resulting run traces and corresponding reference examples to generate automated feedback. The results will be visible in the LangSmith app. ```python from langchain import hub # We will test this version of the prompt prompt = hub.pull(""wfh/langsmith-agent-prompt:798e7324"") ``` ```python import functools from langchain.smith import ( arun_on_dataset, run_on_dataset, ) chain_results = run_on_dataset( dataset_name=dataset_name, llm_or_chain_factory=functools.partial(agent_factory, prompt=prompt), evaluation=evaluation_config, verbose=True, client=client, project_name=f""runnable-agent-test-5d466cbc-{unique_id}"", tags=[ ""testing-notebook"", ""prompt:5d466cbc"", ], # Optional, adds a tag to the resulting chain runs ) # Sometimes, the agent will error due to parsing issues, incompatible tool inputs, etc. # These are logged as warnings here and captured as errors in the tracing UI. ``` ```text View the evaluation results for project \'runnable-agent-test-5d466cbc-bf2162aa\' at: [> ] 0/5 Chain failed for example 54b4fce8-4492-409d-94af-708f51698b39 with inputs {\'input\': \'Who trained Llama-v2?\'} Error Type: TypeError, Message: DuckDuckGoSearchResults._run() got an unexpected keyword argument \'arg1\' [------------------------------------------------->] 5/5 Eval quantiles: 0.25 0.5 0.75 mean mode embedding_cosine_distance 0.086614 0.118841 0.183672 0.151444 0.050158 correctness 0.000000 0.500000 1.000000 0.500000 0.000000 score_string:accuracy 0.775000 1.000000 1.000000 0.775000 1.000000 helpfulness 0.750000 1.000000 1.000000 0.750000 1.000000 ``` ### Review the test results You can review the test results tracing UI below by clicking the URL in the output above or navigating to the ""Testing & Datasets"" page in LangSmith **""agent-qa-{unique_id}""** dataset. ![test results](/assets/images/test_results-15649f0f4500fd64ef2209229951a6c1.png) This will show the new runs and the feedback logged from the selected evaluators.

Let\'s fetch the run traces from the evaluation run. **Note: It may be a few moments before all the runs are accessible.** ```python runs = client.list_runs(project_name=chain_results[""project_name""], execution_order=1) ``` ```python # After some time, these will be populated. client.read_project(project_name=chain_results[""project_name""]).feedback_stats ``` ## Conclusion Congratulations!

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved. I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now. It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue it\'s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables. My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\'ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use! I didn\'t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+.

Check Pinecone's documentation for correct arguments.,"Your error is likely due to an incorrect parameter being passed to the 'similarity_search_with_score' function in the Pinecone vector store. The correct function signature does not include a 'min_score' argument. This function retrieves documents most similar to a given query text while providing both the documents and their corresponding similarity scores. To use 'similarity_search_with_score', ensure you provide the right arguments: 'query' for the text you want to find similar documents for, 'k' for the number of documents to retrieve (default: 4), 'filter' as an optional metadata-based filtering dictionary, and 'namespace' to specify the search namespace (default is the empty namespace '').

46,How can I create a simple chat model using my locally saved huggingface model,"['Memory in LLMChain | Memory in LLMChain This notebook goes over how to use the Memory class with an `LLMChain`. We will add the [ConversationBufferMemory]( class, although this can be any memory class. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` The most important step is setting up the prompt correctly. In the below prompt, we have two input keys: one for the actual input, another for the input from the Memory class. Importantly, we make sure the keys in the `PromptTemplate` and the `ConversationBufferMemory` match up (`chat_history`). ```python template = """"""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. {chat_history} Human: {human_input} Chatbot:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""chat_history"", ""human_input""], template=template ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend Chatbot: > Finished chain. \' Hi there!

Chatbot: > Finished chain. "" I\'m doing great, thanks for asking! How are you doing?"" ``` ## Adding Memory to a chat model-based LLMChain The above works for completion-style `LLM`s, but if you are using a chat model, you will likely get better performance using structured chat messages. Below is an example. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, ) from langchain.schema import SystemMessage ``` We will use the [ChatPromptTemplate]( class to set up the chat prompt. The [from_messages]( method creates a `ChatPromptTemplate` from a list of messages (e.g., `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ChatMessage`, etc.) or message templates, such as the [MessagesPlaceholder]( below. The configuration below makes it so the memory will be injected to the middle of the chat prompt, in the `chat_history` key, and the user\'s inputs will be added in a human/user message to the end of the chat prompt. ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The persistent system prompt MessagesPlaceholder( variable_name=""chat_history"" ), # Where the memory will be stored. HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""{human_input}"" ), # Where the human input will injected ] ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) ``` ```python llm = ChatOpenAI() chat_llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python chat_llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

2. Import the `HuggingFacePipeline` class to work with your local pipeline

```
from langchain.llms import HuggingFacePipeline

# Create an instance of the wrapper
llm = HuggingFacePipeline.from_model_id(""path/to/model_directory"", task=""text-generation"")

The tool is a wrapper for the [PyGitHub]( library. ## Quickstart 1. Install the pygithub library 2. Create a Github app 3. Set your environmental variables 4. Pass the tools to your agent with `toolkit.get_tools()` Each of these steps will be explained in great detail below. 1. **Get Issues**- fetches issues from the repository. 2. **Get Issue**- fetches details about a specific issue. 3. **Comment on Issue**- posts a comment on a specific issue. 4. **Create Pull Request**- creates a pull request from the bot\'s working branch to the base branch. 5. **Create File**- creates a new file in the repository. 6. **Read File**- reads a file from the repository. 7. **Update File**- updates a file in the repository. 8. **Delete File**- deletes a file from the repository. ## Setup ### 1. Install the pygithub library ```python %pip install pygithub ``` ### 2. Create a Github App [Follow the instructions here]( to create and register a Github app. Make sure your app has the following [repository permissions:]( - Commit statuses (read only) - Contents (read and write) - Issues (read and write) - Metadata (read only) - Pull requests (read and write) Once the app has been registered, add it to the repository you wish the bot to act upon. ### 3. Set Environmental Variables Before initializing your agent, the following environmental variables need to be set: - **GITHUB_APP_ID**- A six digit number found in your app\'s general settings - **GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY**- The location of your app\'s private key .pem file - **GITHUB_REPOSITORY**- The name of the Github repository you want your bot to act upon. Must follow the format {username}/{repo-name}. Make sure the app has been added to this repository first! - **GITHUB_BRANCH**- The branch where the bot will make its commits.

[Anthropic]( is an AI safety and research company, and is the creator of Claude. This page covers all integrations between Anthropic models and LangChain. ## Prompting Overview Claude is chat-based model, meaning it is trained on conversation data. However, it is a text based API, meaning it takes in single string. It expects this string to be in a particular format. This means that it is up the user to ensure that is the case. LangChain provides several utilities and helper functions to make sure prompts that you write - whether formatted as a string or as a list of messages - end up formatted correctly. Specifically, Claude is trained to fill in text for the Assistant role as part of an ongoing dialogue between a human user (`Human:`) and an AI assistant (`Assistant:`). Prompts sent via the API must contain `\\n\\nHuman:` and `\\n\\nAssistant:` as the signals of who\'s speaking. The final turn must always be `\\n\\nAssistant:` - the input string cannot have `\\n\\nHuman:` as the final role. Because Claude is chat-based but accepts a string as input, it can be treated as either a LangChain `ChatModel` or `LLM`. This means there are two wrappers in LangChain - `ChatAnthropic` and `Anthropic`. It is generally recommended to use the `ChatAnthropic` wrapper, and format your prompts as `ChatMessage`s (we will show examples of this below). This is because it keeps your prompt in a general format that you can easily then also use with other models (should you want to). However, if you want more fine-grained control over the prompt, you can use the `Anthropic` wrapper - we will show and example of this as well. The `Anthropic` wrapper however is deprecated, as all functionality can be achieved in a more generic way using `ChatAnthropic`. ## Prompting Best Practices Anthropic models have several prompting best practices compared to OpenAI models. **No System Messages** Anthropic models are not trained on the concept of a ""system message"". We have worked with the Anthropic team to handle them somewhat appropriately (a Human message with an `admin` tag) but this is largely a hack and it is recommended that you do not use system messages. **AI Messages Can Continue** A completion from Claude is a continuation of the last text in the string which allows you further control over Claude\'s output. For example, putting words in Claude\'s mouth in a prompt like this: `\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: What do you call a bear with no teeth?` This will return a completion like this `A gummy bear!` instead of a whole new assistant message with a different random bear joke. ## ChatAnthropic `ChatAnthropic` is a subclass of LangChain\'s `ChatModel`, meaning it works best with `ChatPromptTemplate`. You can import this wrapper with the following code: ```text from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic model = ChatAnthropic() ``` When working with ChatModels, it is preferred that you design your prompts as `ChatPromptTemplate`s. Here is an example below of doing that: ```text from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([ (""system"", ""You are a helpful chatbot""), (""human"", ""Tell me a joke about {topic}""), ]) ``` You can then use this in a chain as follows: ```text chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` How is the prompt actually being formatted under the hood? We can see that by running the following code ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nYou are a helpful chatbot\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that under the hood LangChain is not appending any prefix/suffix to `SystemMessage`\'s. This is because Anthropic has no concept of `SystemMessage`. Anthropic requires all prompts to end with assistant messages. This means if the last message is not an assistant message, the suffix `Assistant:` will automatically be inserted. If you decide instead to use a normal PromptTemplate (one that just works on a single string) let\'s take a look at what happens: ```text from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This produces the following formatted string: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant:\' ``` We can see that it automatically adds the Human and Assistant tags. What is happening under the hood? First: the string gets converted to a single human message. This happens generically (because we are using a subclass of `ChatModel`). Then, similarly to the above example, an empty Assistant message is getting appended. This is Anthropic specific. ## [Deprecated] Anthropic This `Anthropic` wrapper is subclassed from `LLM`. We can import it with: ```text from langchain.llms import Anthropic model = Anthropic() ``` This model class is designed to work with normal PromptTemplates. An example of that is below: ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") chain = prompt | model chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bears""}) ``` Let\'s see what is going on with the prompt templating under the hood! ```text prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs the following ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:\\n\' ``` Notice that it adds the Human tag at the start of the string, and then finishes it with `\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here you go:`. The extra `Sure, here you go` was added on purpose by the Anthropic team. What happens if we have those symbols in the prompt directly? ```text prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Human: Tell me a joke about {topic}"") prompt_value = prompt.format_prompt(topic=""bears"") model.convert_prompt(prompt_value) ``` This outputs: ```text \'\\n\\nHuman: Tell me a joke about bears\' ``` We can see that we detect that the user is trying to use the special tokens, and so we don\'t do any formatting. - [Prompting Overview](#prompting-overview) - [Prompting Best Practices](#prompting-best-practices) - [ChatAnthropic](#chatanthropic) - [Deprecated Anthropic](#deprecated-anthropic)', 'Dynamically route logic based on input | Dynamically route logic based on input This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language. Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`.

    from langchain.agents import load_tools
    from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
    from langchain.agents import AgentType
    from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic

Next, create an instance of ChatAnthropic. Make sure you have set your API key in an environment variable called ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or pass anthropic_api_key as a parameter.

    chat = ChatAnthropic()

Next, load some tools for your agent to use:

48,How do I use Qdrant as a vector store in the conversational retrieval chain?,"['Chatbots | Chatbots []( ## Use case Chatbots are one of the central LLM use-cases. The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

The options include: - Local mode, no server required - On-premise server deployment - Qdrant Cloud See the [installation instructions]( ```bash pip install qdrant-client ``` We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` ```text OpenAI API Key: ``` ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant ``` ```python loader = TextLoader(""../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() ``` ## Connecting to Qdrant from LangChain ### Local mode Python client allows you to run the same code in local mode without running the Qdrant server. That\'s great for testing things out and debugging or if you plan to store just a small amount of vectors. The embeddings might be fully kepy in memory or persisted on disk. #### In-memory For some testing scenarios and quick experiments, you may prefer to keep all the data in memory only, so it gets lost when the client is destroyed - usually at the end of your script/notebook. ```python qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, location="":memory:"", # Local mode with in-memory storage only collection_name=""my_documents"", ) ``` #### On-disk storage Local mode, without using the Qdrant server, may also store your vectors on disk so they\'re persisted between runs. ```python qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, path=""/tmp/local_qdrant"", collection_name=""my_documents"", ) ``` ### On-premise server deployment No matter if you choose to launch Qdrant locally with [a Docker container]( or select a Kubernetes deployment with [the official Helm chart]( the way you\'re going to connect to such an instance will be identical. You\'ll need to provide a URL pointing to the service. ```python url = """" qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, url=url, prefer_grpc=True, collection_name=""my_documents"", ) ``` ### Qdrant Cloud If you prefer not to keep yourself busy with managing the infrastructure, you can choose to set up a fully-managed Qdrant cluster on [Qdrant Cloud]( There is a free forever 1GB cluster included for trying out. The main difference with using a managed version of Qdrant is that you\'ll need to provide an API key to secure your deployment from being accessed publicly. ```python url = """" api_key = """" qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, url=url, prefer_grpc=True, api_key=api_key, collection_name=""my_documents"", ) ``` ## Recreating the collection Both `Qdrant.from_texts` and `Qdrant.from_documents` methods are great to start using Qdrant with Langchain. In the previous versions the collection was recreated every time you called any of them. That behaviour has changed. Currently, the collection is going to be reused if it already exists. Setting `force_recreate` to `True` allows to remove the old collection and start from scratch. ```python url = """" qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, url=url, prefer_grpc=True, collection_name=""my_documents"", force_recreate=True, ) ``` ## Similarity search The simplest scenario for using Qdrant vector store is to perform a similarity search. Under the hood, our query will be encoded with the `embedding_function` and used to find similar documents in Qdrant collection. ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search(query) ``` ```python print(found_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you\'re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. Tonight, I\'d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyeran Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation\'s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\'s legacy of excellence. ``` ## Similarity search with score Sometimes we might want to perform the search, but also obtain a relevancy score to know how good is a particular result. The returned distance score is cosine distance. Therefore, a lower score is better. ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search_with_score(query) ``` ```python document, score = found_docs[0] print(document.page_content) print(f""\\nScore: {score}"") ``` ```text Tonight.

Score: 0.8153784913324512 ``` ### Metadata filtering Qdrant has an [extensive filtering system]( with rich type support. It is also possible to use the filters in Langchain, by passing an additional param to both the `similarity_search_with_score` and `similarity_search` methods. ```python from qdrant_client.http import models as rest query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" found_docs = qdrant.similarity_search_with_score(query, filter=rest.Filter(...)) ``` ## Maximum marginal relevance search (MMR) If you\'d like to look up for some similar documents, but you\'d also like to receive diverse results, MMR is method you should consider. Maximal marginal relevance optimizes for similarity to query AND diversity among selected documents. ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" found_docs = qdrant.max_marginal_relevance_search(query, k=2, fetch_k=10) ``` ```python for i, doc in enumerate(found_docs): print(f""{i + 1}."", doc.page_content, ""\\n"") ``` ```text 1.

We can\'t change how divided we\'ve been. But we can change how we move forwardon COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. Officer Mora was 27 years old. Officer Rivera was 22. Both Dominican Americans who\'d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. I\'ve worked on these issues a long time. I know what works: Investing in crime prevention and community police officers who\'ll walk the beat, who\'ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. ``` ## Qdrant as a Retriever Qdrant, as all the other vector stores, is a LangChain Retriever, by using cosine similarity. ```python retriever = qdrant.as_retriever() retriever ``` ```text VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=, search_type=\'similarity\', search_kwargs={}) ``` It might be also specified to use MMR as a search strategy, instead of similarity. ```python retriever = qdrant.as_retriever(search_type=""mmr"") retriever ``` ```text VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=, search_type=\'mmr\', search_kwargs={}) ``` ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)[0] ``` ```text Document(page_content=\'Tonight.

In such cases you may need to define how to map Qdrant point into the Langchain `Document`. ### Named vectors Qdrant supports [multiple vectors per point]( by named vectors. Langchain requires just a single embedding per document and, by default, uses a single vector. However, if you work with a collection created externally or want to have the named vector used, you can configure it by providing its name. ```python Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, location="":memory:"", collection_name=""my_documents_2"", vector_name=""custom_vector"", ) ``` As a Langchain user, you won\'t see any difference whether you use named vectors or not. Qdrant integration will handle the conversion under the hood. ### Metadata Qdrant stores your vector embeddings along with the optional JSON-like payload. Payloads are optional, but since LangChain assumes the embeddings are generated from the documents, we keep the context data, so you can extract the original texts as well. By default, your document is going to be stored in the following payload structure: ```json { ""page_content"": ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"", ""metadata"": { ""foo"": ""bar"" } } ``` You can, however, decide to use different keys for the page content and metadata. That\'s useful if you already have a collection that you\'d like to reuse. ```python Qdrant.from_documents( docs, embeddings, location="":memory:"", collection_name=""my_documents_2"", content_payload_key=""my_page_content_key"", metadata_payload_key=""my_meta"", ) ``` ```text ``` - [Connecting to Qdrant from LangChain](#connecting-to-qdrant-from-langchain)- [Local mode](#local-mode) - [On-premise server deployment](#on-premise-server-deployment) - [Qdrant Cloud](#qdrant-cloud) - [Recreating the collection](#recreating-the-collection) - [Similarity search](#similarity-search) - [Similarity search with score](#similarity-search-with-score)- [Metadata filtering](#metadata-filtering) - [Maximum marginal relevance search (MMR)](#maximum-marginal-relevance-search-mmr) - [Qdrant as a Retriever](#qdrant-as-a-retriever) - [Customizing Qdrant](#customizing-qdrant)- [Named vectors](#named-vectors) - [Metadata](#metadata)']","Use `Qdrant.as_retriever()` to create a retriever, then pass it to `ConversationalRetrievalChain`.","In order to use Qdrant as a vector store in the conversational retrieval chain, you should start by installing Qdrant:

    pip install qdrant-client

Next, import the necessary classes and functions:

    from langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant
    from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
    from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
    from langchain.llms import OpenAI
    from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
    from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
    from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

Load, split, and embed your documents:

    loader = TextLoader(""state_of_the_union.txt"")
    documents = loader.load()

    text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0, separator=""
"")
    documents = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

Next, connect to Qdrant. This is for storing locally on-disk, but you can also use an on-premise server deployment or store on the Qdrant cloud:

    qdrant = Qdrant.from_documents(
        documents,
        embeddings,
        path=""/tmp/local_qdrant"",
        collection_name=""my_documents"",
    )

Next, create a memory object, which is necessary to track the inputs/outputs and hold a conversation:

    memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True)

Now initialize the ConversationalRetrievalChain:

    qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), qdrant.as_retriever(), memory=memory)

Now, you can create queries to test it out:

    query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
    result = qa({""question"": query})

Output:

    The president said that he had nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the United States Supreme Court four days ago.

    query = ""Who are they succeeding?""
    result = qa({""question"": query})

Output:

To combine multiple memory classes, we initialize and use the `CombinedMemory` class. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ( CombinedMemory, ConversationBufferMemory, ConversationSummaryMemory, ) from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate conv_memory = ConversationBufferMemory( memory_key=""chat_history_lines"", input_key=""input"" ) summary_memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(), input_key=""input"") # Combined memory = CombinedMemory(memories=[conv_memory, summary_memory]) _DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = """"""The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI.

The core features of chatbots are that they can have long-running conversations and have access to information that users want to know about. Aside from basic prompting and LLMs, memory and retrieval are the core components of a chatbot. Memory allows a chatbot to remember past interactions, and retrieval provides a chatbot with up-to-date, domain-specific information. ![Image description](/assets/images/chat_use_case-eb8a4883931d726e9f23628a0d22e315.png) ## Overview The chat model interface is based around messages rather than raw text. Several components are important to consider for chat: - `chat model`: See [here](/docs/integrations/chat) for a list of chat model integrations and [here](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) for documentation on the chat model interface in LangChain. You can use `LLMs` (see [here](/docs/modules/model_io/llms)) for chatbots as well, but chat models have a more conversational tone and natively support a message interface. - `prompt template`: Prompt templates make it easy to assemble prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context. - `memory`: [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types - `retriever` (optional): [See here](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers) for in-depth documentation on retrieval systems. These are useful if you want to build a chatbot with domain-specific knowledge. ## Quickstart Here\'s a quick preview of how we can create chatbot interfaces. First let\'s install some dependencies and set the required credentials: ```bash pip install langchain openai # Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file: # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` With a plain chat model, we can get chat completions by [passing one or more messages](/docs/modules/model_io/chat) to the model. The chat model will respond with a message. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage chat = ChatOpenAI() chat( [ HumanMessage( content=""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."" ) ] ) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` And if we pass in a list of messages: ```python messages = [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."" ), HumanMessage(content=""I love programming.""), ] chat(messages) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=""J\'adore la programmation."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False) ``` We can then wrap our chat model in a `ConversationChain`, which has built-in memory for remembering past user inputs and model outputs. ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationChain conversation = ConversationChain(llm=chat) conversation.run(""Translate this sentence from English to French: I love programming."") ``` ```text \'Je adore la programmation.\' ``` ```python conversation.run(""Translate it to German."") ``` ```text \'Ich liebe Programmieren.\' ``` ## Memory As we mentioned above, the core component of chatbots is the memory system. One of the simplest and most commonly used forms of memory is `ConversationBufferMemory`: - This memory allows for storing of messages in a `buffer` - When called in a chain, it returns all of the messages it has stored LangChain comes with many other types of memory, too. [See here](/docs/modules/memory/) for in-depth documentation on memory types. For now let\'s take a quick look at ConversationBufferMemory. We can manually add a few chat messages to the memory like so: ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` And now we can load from our memory. The key method exposed by all `Memory` classes is `load_memory_variables`. This takes in any initial chain input and returns a list of memory variables which are added to the chain input. Since this simple memory type doesn\'t actually take into account the chain input when loading memory, we can pass in an empty input for now: ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: hi!\\nAI: whats up?\'} ``` We can also keep a sliding window of the most recent `k` interactions using `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=1) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'Human: not much you\\nAI: not much\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryMemory` is an extension of this theme. It creates a summary of the conversation over time. This memory is most useful for longer conversations where the full message history would consume many tokens. ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""im working on better docs for chatbots""}, {""output"": ""oh, that sounds like a lot of work""}, ) memory.save_context( {""input"": ""yes, but it\'s worth the effort""}, {""output"": ""agreed, good docs are important!""}, ) ``` ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': \'\\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds. The human then mentions they are working on better docs for chatbots, to which the AI responds that it sounds like a lot of work. The human agrees that it is worth the effort, and the AI agrees that good docs are important.\'} ``` `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` extends this a bit further: It uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10) memory.save_context({""input"": ""hi""}, {""output"": ""whats up""}) memory.save_context({""input"": ""not much you""}, {""output"": ""not much""}) ``` ## Conversation We can unpack what goes under the hood with `ConversationChain`. We can specify our memory, `ConversationSummaryMemory` and we can specify the prompt. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, ) # LLM llm = ChatOpenAI() # Prompt prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}""), ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory) # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

This is popular use case, combining chat with [document retrieval](/docs/use_cases/question_answering). It allows us to chat with specific information that the model was not trained on. ```bash pip install tiktoken chromadb ``` Load a blog post. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() ``` Split and store this in a vector. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Create our memory, as before, but\'s let\'s use `ConversationSummaryMemory`. ```python memory = ConversationSummaryMemory( llm=llm, memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True ) ``` ```python from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI() retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(llm, retriever=retriever, memory=memory) ``` ```python qa(""How do agents use Task decomposition?"") ``` ```text {\'question\': \'How do agents use Task decomposition?\', \'chat_history\': [SystemMessage(content=\'\', additional_kwargs={})], \'answer\': \'Agents can use task decomposition in several ways:\\n\\n1.

Task-specific instructions: Agents can be given task-specific instructions to guide their planning process.

This provides a high-level structure for the task and helps in breaking it down into smaller components.\\n\\n3. Human inputs: Agents can also take inputs from humans to decompose tasks. This can be done through direct communication or by leveraging human expertise.

Internet Access: The agent can use internet access to search for relevant information and gather resources to aid in task decomposition. This allows the agent to access a vast amount of information and utilize it in the decomposition process.\\n\\n3. GPT-3.5 Powered Agents: The agent can delegate simple tasks to GPT-3.5 powered agents. These agents can perform specific tasks or provide assistance in task decomposition, allowing the main agent to focus on higher-level planning and decision-making.\\n\\n4. File Output: The agent can store the results of task decomposition in files or documents. This allows for easy retrieval and reference during the execution of the task.\\n\\nThese memory resources help the agent in organizing and managing information, making informed decisions, and effectively decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals.\'} ``` Again, we can use the [LangSmith trace]( to explore the prompt structure. ### Going deeper - Agents, such as the [conversational retrieval agent](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/conversational_retrieval_agents), can be used for retrieval when necessary while also holding a conversation. - [Use case](#use-case) - [Overview](#overview) - [Quickstart](#quickstart) - [Memory](#memory) - [Conversation](#conversation) - [Chat Retrieval](#chat-retrieval)- [Going deeper](#going-deeper)', 'RAG with Agents | RAG with Agents This is an agent specifically optimized for doing retrieval when necessary and also holding a conversation. To start, we will set up the retriever we want to use, and then turn it into a retriever tool. Next, we will use the high level constructor for this type of agent. Finally, we will walk through how to construct a conversational retrieval agent from components. ## The Retriever To start, we need a retriever to use! The code here is mostly just example code. Feel free to use your own retriever and skip to the section on creating a retriever tool. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader loader = TextLoader(""../../../../../docs/docs/modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() db = FAISS.from_documents(texts, embeddings) ``` ```python retriever = db.as_retriever() ``` ## Retriever Tool Now we need to create a tool for our retriever. The main things we need to pass in are a name for the retriever as well as a description. These will both be used by the language model, so they should be informative. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool ``` ```python tool = create_retriever_tool( retriever, ""search_state_of_union"", ""Searches and returns documents regarding the state-of-the-union."", ) tools = [tool] ``` ## Agent Constructor Here, we will use the high level `create_conversational_retrieval_agent` API to construct the agent. Notice that beside the list of tools, the only thing we need to pass in is a language model to use. Under the hood, this agent is using the OpenAIFunctionsAgent, so we need to use an ChatOpenAI model. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_conversational_retrieval_agent ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python agent_executor = create_conversational_retrieval_agent(llm, tools, verbose=True) ``` We can now try it out! ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""hi, im bob""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Hello Bob! How can I assist you today? > Finished chain. ``` ```python result[""output""] ``` ```text \'Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?\' ``` Notice that it remembers your name ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""whats my name?""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Your name is Bob. > Finished chain. ``` ```python result[""output""] ``` ```text \'Your name is Bob.\' ``` Notice that it now does retrieval ```python result = agent_executor( { ""input"": ""what did the president say about kentaji brown jackson in the most recent state of the union?"" } ) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Let\'s take a look so we can understand how to modify going forward. There are a few components: - The memory - The prompt template - The agent - The agent executor ```python # This is needed for both the memory and the prompt memory_key = ""history"" ``` ### The Memory In this example, we want the agent to remember not only previous conversations, but also previous intermediate steps. For that, we can use `AgentTokenBufferMemory`. Note that if you want to change whether the agent remembers intermediate steps, or how the long the buffer is, or anything like that you should change this part. ```python from langchain.agents.openai_functions_agent.agent_token_buffer_memory import ( AgentTokenBufferMemory, ) memory = AgentTokenBufferMemory(memory_key=memory_key, llm=llm) ``` ## The Prompt Template For the prompt template, we will use the `OpenAIFunctionsAgent` default way of creating one, but pass in a system prompt and a placeholder for memory. ```python from langchain.agents.openai_functions_agent.base import OpenAIFunctionsAgent from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder from langchain.schema.messages import SystemMessage ``` ```python system_message = SystemMessage( content=( ""Do your best to answer the questions. "" ""Feel free to use any tools available to look up "" ""relevant information, only if necessary"" ) ) ``` ```python prompt = OpenAIFunctionsAgent.create_prompt( system_message=system_message, extra_prompt_messages=[MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=memory_key)], ) ``` ## The Agent We will use the OpenAIFunctionsAgent ```python agent = OpenAIFunctionsAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt) ``` ## The Agent Executor Importantly, we pass in `return_intermediate_steps=True` since we are recording that with our memory object ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor( agent=agent, tools=tools, memory=memory, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True, ) ``` ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""hi, im bob""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Hello Bob! How can I assist you today? > Finished chain. ``` ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""whats my name""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Your name is Bob. > Finished chain. ``` - [The Retriever](#the-retriever) - [Retriever Tool](#retriever-tool) - [Agent Constructor](#agent-constructor) - [Creating from components](#creating-from-components)- [The Memory](#the-memory) - [The Prompt Template](#the-prompt-template) - [The Agent](#the-agent) - [The Agent Executor](#the-agent-executor)']",Use `ConversationSummaryMemory`.,"In order to use Summary Memory in the conversational retrieval chain, you should first import the necessary classes and functions:

        from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory
    from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
    from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma # You can choose any LangChain vectorstore
    from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
    from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI # You can choose any LangChain vectorstore
    from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
    from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader

Split and embed your documents, and add them to your selected vectorstore:

    loader = TextLoader(""state_of_the_union.txt"")
    documents = loader.load()

    text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0, separator=""
"")
    documents = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents, embeddings)

Next, create a ConversationSummaryMemory object:

    memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo""), memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True)

Now initialize the ConversationalRetrievalChain:

    qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"",temperature=0), vectorstore.as_retriever(), memory=memory)

Now, you can create queries to test it out:

    query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson""
    result = qa({""question"": query})

Output:

    The president said that he had nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the United States Supreme Court four days ago.

    query = ""Who are they succeeding?""
    result = qa.invoke({""question"": query})

Output:

50,What's the difference between a document loader and a chat loader?,"['YouTube audio | YouTube audio Building chat or QA applications on YouTube videos is a topic of high interest. Below we show how to easily go from a `YouTube url` to `audio of the video` to `text` to `chat`! We wil use the `OpenAIWhisperParser`, which will use the OpenAI Whisper API to transcribe audio to text, and the `OpenAIWhisperParserLocal` for local support and running on private clouds or on premise. Note: You will need to have an `OPENAI_API_KEY` supplied. ```python from langchain.document_loaders.blob_loaders.youtube_audio import YoutubeAudioLoader from langchain.document_loaders.generic import GenericLoader from langchain.document_loaders.parsers import ( OpenAIWhisperParser, OpenAIWhisperParserLocal, ) ``` We will use `yt_dlp` to download audio for YouTube urls. We will use `pydub` to split downloaded audio files (such that we adhere to Whisper API\'s 25MB file size limit). ```bash pip install yt_dlp pip install pydub pip install librosa ``` ### YouTube url to text Use `YoutubeAudioLoader` to fetch / download the audio files.

The main difference between the two is that the encoder is used to encode the input sequence into a fixed-length representation, while the decoder is used to decode the fixed-length representation into an output sequence. In machine translation, for example, the encoder reads in the source language sentence and generates a fixed-length representation, which is then used by the decoder to generate the target language sentence.\' ``` ```python query = ""For any token, what are x, k, v, and q?"" qa_chain.run(query) ``` ```text \'For any token, x is the input vector that contains the private information of that token, k and q are the key and query vectors respectively, which are produced by forwarding linear modules on x, and v is the vector that is calculated by propagating the same linear module on x again.

Show this page source""]","To load YouTube transcripts, you can use the `YoutubeLoader` from the `langchain.document_loaders` module. Here's a basic example:

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import YoutubeLoader

loader = YoutubeLoader.from_youtube_url(""YOUR_YOUTUBE_URL_HERE"")
documents = loader.load()
```

For CSV documents, you would typically use a different loader, such as `CSVLoader`. Here's an example:

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import CSVLoader

loader = CSVLoader(file_path=""YOUR_CSV_FILE_PATH_HERE"")
documents = loader.load()
```

Make sure to replace `""YOUR_YOUTUBE_URL_HERE""` and `""YOUR_CSV_FILE_PATH_HERE""` with the actual URL or file path.

I'm an AI system built by a team of inventors at Amazon, here to help with your queries.","To load YouTube transcripts in LangChain, you can use the YoutubeLoader document loader. Here's an example of how to do it:

Install the required packages:
```
pip install langchain youtube_transcript_api pytube
```

Import the necessary classes:

52,my agent keeps getting an OutputParserException is something i can set to make it take care of these?,"['Handle parsing errors | Handle parsing errors Occasionally the LLM cannot determine what step to take because its outputs are not correctly formatted to be handled by the output parser.

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved. I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now. It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue it\'s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables. My original cable is pretty beat up - like most that I see - but I\'ve been beaten up much MUCH less by sticking with its use! I didn\'t find that the casing/shell around it or not made any diff.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\ngreat now I have to wait one more hour to reset my phone and while I was tryin to connect my phone to my computer the computer also restarted smh does anyone else knows how I can get my phone to work my problem is I have a black dot on the bottom left of my screen an it wont allow me to touch a certain part of my screen unless I rotate my phone and I know the password but the first number is a 2 and it won\\\'t let me touch 1,2, or 3 so now I have to find a way to get rid of my password and all of a sudden my phone wants to touch stuff on its own which got my phone disabled many times to the point where I have to wait a whole hour and I really need to finish something on my phone today PLEASE HELPPPP\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIn my case , iphone 6 screen was faulty. I got it replaced at local repair shop, so far phone is working fine.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthis problem in iphone 6 has many different scenarios and solutions, first try to reconnect the lcd screen to the motherboard again, if didnt solve, try to replace the lcd connector on the motherboard, if not solved, then remains two issues, lcd screen it self or touch IC. in my country some repair shops just change them all for almost 40$ since they dont want to troubleshoot one by one. readers of this comment also should know that partial screen not responding in other iphone models might also have an issue in LCD connector on the motherboard, specially if you lock/unlock screen and screen works again for sometime. lcd connectors gets disconnected lightly from the motherboard due to multiple falls and hits after sometime. best of luck for all\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI am facing the same issue whereby these ghost touches type and open apps , I am using an original Iphone cable , how to I fix this issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nThere were two issues with the phone I had troubles with. It was my dads and turns out he carried it in his pocket. The phone itself had a little bend in it as a result. A little pressure in the opposite direction helped the issue. But it also had a tiny crack in the screen which wasnt obvious, once we added a screen protector this fixed the issues entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI had the same problem with my 64Gb iPhone 6+. Tried a lot of things and eventually downloaded all my images and videos to my PC and restarted the phone - problem solved.

The overall steps are: 1. Download your messenger data to disk. 2. Create the Chat Loader and call `loader.load()` (or `loader.lazy_load()`) to perform the conversion. 3. Optionally use `merge_chat_runs` to combine message from the same sender in sequence, and/or `map_ai_messages` to convert messages from the specified sender to the ""AIMessage"" class. Once you\'ve done this, call `convert_messages_for_finetuning` to prepare your data for fine-tuning. Once this has been done, you can fine-tune your model. To do so you would complete the following steps: 1. Upload your messages to OpenAI and run a fine-tuning job. 2. Use the resulting model in your LangChain app! Let\'s begin. ## 1. Download Data To download your own messenger data, following instructions [here]( IMPORTANT - make sure to download them in JSON format (not HTML). We are hosting an example dump at [this google drive link]( that we will use in this walkthrough. ```python # This uses some example data import zipfile import requests def download_and_unzip(url: str, output_path: str = ""file.zip"") -> None: file_id = url.split(""/"")[-2] download_url = f"" response = requests.get(download_url) if response.status_code != 200: print(""Failed to download the file."") return with open(output_path, ""wb"") as file: file.write(response.content) print(f""File {output_path} downloaded."") with zipfile.ZipFile(output_path, ""r"") as zip_ref: zip_ref.extractall() print(f""File {output_path} has been unzipped."") # URL of the file to download url = ( "" ) # Download and unzip download_and_unzip(url) ``` ```text File file.zip downloaded. File file.zip has been unzipped. ``` ## 2. Create Chat Loader We have 2 different `FacebookMessengerChatLoader` classes, one for an entire directory of chats, and one to load individual files. We ```python directory_path = ""./hogwarts"" ``` ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.facebook_messenger import ( FolderFacebookMessengerChatLoader, SingleFileFacebookMessengerChatLoader, ) ``` ```python loader = SingleFileFacebookMessengerChatLoader( path=""./hogwarts/inbox/HermioneGranger/messages_Hermione_Granger.json"", ) ``` ```python chat_session = loader.load()[0] chat_session[""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=""Hi Hermione! How\'s your summer going so far?"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""Harry! Lovely to hear from you. My summer is going well, though I do miss everyone. I\'m spending most of my time going through my books and researching fascinating new topics. How about you?"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Hermione Granger\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""I miss you all too. The Dursleys are being their usual unpleasant selves but I\'m getting by. At least I can practice some spells in my room without them knowing. Let me know if you find anything good in your researching!"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False)] ``` ```python loader = FolderFacebookMessengerChatLoader( path=""./hogwarts"", ) ``` ```python chat_sessions = loader.load() len(chat_sessions) ``` ```text 9 ``` ## 3. Prepare for fine-tuning Calling `load()` returns all the chat messages we could extract as human messages. When conversing with chat bots, conversations typically follow a more strict alternating dialogue pattern relative to real conversations. You can choose to merge message ""runs"" (consecutive messages from the same sender) and select a sender to represent the ""AI"". The fine-tuned LLM will learn to generate these AI messages. ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.utils import ( map_ai_messages, merge_chat_runs, ) ``` ```python merged_sessions = merge_chat_runs(chat_sessions) alternating_sessions = list(map_ai_messages(merged_sessions, ""Harry Potter"")) ``` ```python # Now all of Harry Potter\'s messages will take the AI message class # which maps to the \'assistant\' role in OpenAI\'s training format alternating_sessions[0][""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [AIMessage(content=""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""What is it, Potter? I\'m quite busy at the moment."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Severus Snape\'}, example=False), AIMessage(content=""I apologize for the interruption, sir. I\'ll be brief. I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False)] ``` #### Now we can convert to OpenAI format dictionaries ```python from langchain.adapters.openai import convert_messages_for_finetuning ``` ```python training_data = convert_messages_for_finetuning(alternating_sessions) print(f""Prepared {len(training_data)} dialogues for training"") ``` ```text Prepared 9 dialogues for training ``` ```python training_data[0][:3] ``` ```text [{\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately.""}, {\'role\': \'user\', \'content\': ""What is it, Potter? I\'m quite busy at the moment.""}, {\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""I apologize for the interruption, sir. I\'ll be brief. I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister.""}] ``` OpenAI currently requires at least 10 training examples for a fine-tuning job, though they recommend between 50-100 for most tasks. Since we only have 9 chat sessions, we can subdivide them (optionally with some overlap) so that each training example is comprised of a portion of a whole conversation. Facebook chat sessions (1 per person) often span multiple days and conversations, so the long-range dependencies may not be that important to model anyhow. ```python # Our chat is alternating, we will make each datapoint a group of 8 messages, # with 2 messages overlapping chunk_size = 8 overlap = 2 training_examples = [ conversation_messages[i : i + chunk_size] for conversation_messages in training_data for i in range(0, len(conversation_messages) - chunk_size + 1, chunk_size - overlap) ] len(training_examples) ``` ```text 100 ``` ## 4. Fine-tune the model It\'s time to fine-tune the model. Make sure you have `openai` installed and have set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` appropriately ```python # %pip install -U openai --quiet ``` ```python import json import time from io import BytesIO import openai # We will write the jsonl file in memory my_file = BytesIO() for m in training_examples: my_file.write((json.dumps({""messages"": m}) + ""\\n"").encode(""utf-8"")) my_file.seek(0) training_file = openai.File.create(file=my_file, purpose=""fine-tune"") # OpenAI audits each training file for compliance reasons. # This make take a few minutes status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""processed"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status print(f""File {training_file.id} ready after {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds."") ``` ```text File file-zCyNBeg4snpbBL7VkvsuhCz8 ready afer 30.55 seconds. ``` With the file ready, it\'s time to kick off a training job. ```python job = openai.FineTuningJob.create( training_file=training_file.id, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) ``` Grab a cup of tea while your model is being prepared. This may take some time! ```python status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""succeeded"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) job = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id) status = job.status ``` ```text Status=[running]... 908.87s ``` ```python print(job.fine_tuned_model) ``` ```text ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::7rDwkaOq ``` ## 5. Use in LangChain You can use the resulting model ID directly the `ChatOpenAI` model class. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI model = ChatOpenAI( model=job.fine_tuned_model, temperature=1, ) ``` ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) chain = prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python for tok in chain.stream({""input"": ""What classes are you taking?""}): print(tok, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text The usual - Potions, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts.

Last updated on Nov 17, 2023. Show this page source"", ""Agent Types | Agent Types Agents use an LLM to determine which actions to take and in what order. An action can either be using a tool and observing its output, or returning a response to the user. Here are the agents available in LangChain. ## Zero-shot ReAct This agent uses the [ReAct]( framework to determine which tool to use based solely on the tool's description. Any number of tools can be provided. This agent requires that a description is provided for each tool. **Note**: This is the most general purpose action agent. ## Structured input ReAct The structured tool chat agent is capable of using multi-input tools. Older agents are configured to specify an action input as a single string, but this agent can use a tools' argument schema to create a structured action input. This is useful for more complex tool usage, like precisely navigating around a browser. ## OpenAI Functions Certain OpenAI models (like gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613) have been explicitly fine-tuned to detect when a function should be called and respond with the inputs that should be passed to the function. The OpenAI Functions Agent is designed to work with these models. ## Conversational This agent is designed to be used in conversational settings. The prompt is designed to make the agent helpful and conversational. It uses the ReAct framework to decide which tool to use, and uses memory to remember the previous conversation interactions. ## Self-ask with search This agent utilizes a single tool that should be named `Intermediate Answer`.

54,What are intermediate steps in langchain?,"[""LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) | LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) LangChain Expression Language, or LCEL, is a declarative way to easily compose chains together. LCEL was designed from day 1 to **support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes**, from the simplest prompt + LLM chain to the most complex chains (we've seen folks successfully run LCEL chains with 100s of steps in production). To highlight a few of the reasons you might want to use LCEL: **Streaming support** When you build your chains with LCEL you get the best possible time-to-first-token (time elapsed until the first chunk of output comes out). For some chains this means eg. we stream tokens straight from an LLM to a streaming output parser, and you get back parsed, incremental chunks of output at the same rate as the LLM provider outputs the raw tokens. **Async support** Any chain built with LCEL can be called both with the synchronous API (eg. in your Jupyter notebook while prototyping) as well as with the asynchronous API (eg. in a [LangServe](/docs/langsmith) server). This enables using the same code for prototypes and in production, with great performance, and the ability to handle many concurrent requests in the same server. **Optimized parallel execution** Whenever your LCEL chains have steps that can be executed in parallel (eg if you fetch documents from multiple retrievers) we automatically do it, both in the sync and the async interfaces, for the smallest possible latency. **Retries and fallbacks** Configure retries and fallbacks for any part of your LCEL chain. This is a great way to make your chains more reliable at scale. We're currently working on adding streaming support for retries/fallbacks, so you can get the added reliability without any latency cost. **Access intermediate results** For more complex chains it's often very useful to access the results of intermediate steps even before the final output is produced. This can be used let end-users know something is happening, or even just to debug your chain. You can stream intermediate results, and it's available on every [LangServe](/docs/langserve) server. **Input and output schemas** Input and output schemas give every LCEL chain Pydantic and JSONSchema schemas inferred from the structure of your chain. This can be used for validation of inputs and outputs, and is an integral part of LangServe. **Seamless LangSmith tracing integration** As your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what exactly is happening at every step. With LCEL, **all** steps are automatically logged to [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith/) for maximum observability and debuggability. **Seamless LangServe deployment integration** Any chain created with LCEL can be easily deployed using [LangServe](/docs/langserve)."", 'Access intermediate steps | Access intermediate steps In order to get more visibility into what an agent is doing, we can also return intermediate steps.

56,What's function calling,"['Vespa | Vespa [Vespa]( is a fully featured search engine and vector database. It supports vector search (ANN), lexical search, and search in structured data, all in the same query. This notebook shows how to use `Vespa.ai` as a LangChain vector store. In order to create the vector store, we use [pyvespa]( to create a connection a `Vespa` service. ```python #!pip install pyvespa ``` Using the `pyvespa` package, you can either connect to a [Vespa Cloud instance]( or a local [Docker instance]( Here, we will create a new Vespa application and deploy that using Docker. #### Creating a Vespa application First, we need to create an application package: ```python from vespa.package import ApplicationPackage, Field, RankProfile app_package = ApplicationPackage(name=""testapp"") app_package.schema.add_fields( Field( name=""text"", type=""string"", indexing=[""index"", ""summary""], index=""enable-bm25"" ), Field( name=""embedding"", type=""tensor(x[384])"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""], attribute=[""distance-metric: angular""], ), ) app_package.schema.add_rank_profile( RankProfile( name=""default"", first_phase=""closeness(field, embedding)"", inputs=[(""query(query_embedding)"", ""tensor(x[384])"")], ) ) ``` This sets up a Vespa application with a schema for each document that contains two fields: `text` for holding the document text and `embedding` for holding the embedding vector. The `text` field is set up to use a BM25 index for efficient text retrieval, and we\'ll see how to use this and hybrid search a bit later. The `embedding` field is set up with a vector of length 384 to hold the embedding representation of the text. See [Vespa\'s Tensor Guide]( for more on tensors in Vespa. Lastly, we add a [rank profile]( to instruct Vespa how to order documents. Here we set this up with a [nearest neighbor search]( Now we can deploy this application locally: ```python from vespa.deployment import VespaDocker vespa_docker = VespaDocker() vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) ``` This deploys and creates a connection to a `Vespa` service. In case you already have a Vespa application running, for instance in the cloud, please refer to the PyVespa application for how to connect. #### Creating a Vespa vector store Now, let\'s load some documents: ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter loader = TextLoader(""../../modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) from langchain.embeddings.sentence_transformer import SentenceTransformerEmbeddings embedding_function = SentenceTransformerEmbeddings(model_name=""all-MiniLM-L6-v2"") ``` Here, we also set up local sentence embedder to transform the text to embedding vectors. One could also use OpenAI embeddings, but the vector length needs to be updated to `1536` to reflect the larger size of that embedding. To feed these to Vespa, we need to configure how the vector store should map to fields in the Vespa application. Then we create the vector store directly from this set of documents: ```python vespa_config = dict( page_content_field=""text"", embedding_field=""embedding"", input_field=""query_embedding"", ) from langchain.vectorstores import VespaStore db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) ``` This creates a Vespa vector store and feeds that set of documents to Vespa. The vector store takes care of calling the embedding function for each document and inserts them into the database. We can now query the vector store: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query) print(results[0].page_content) ``` This will use the embedding function given above to create a representation for the query and use that to search Vespa. Note that this will use the `default` ranking function, which we set up in the application package above. You can use the `ranking` argument to `similarity_search` to specify which ranking function to use. Please refer to the [pyvespa documentation]( for more information. This covers the basic usage of the Vespa store in LangChain. Now you can return the results and continue using these in LangChain. #### Updating documents An alternative to calling `from_documents`, you can create the vector store directly and call `add_texts` from that. This can also be used to update documents: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query) result = results[0] result.page_content = ""UPDATED: "" + result.page_content db.add_texts([result.page_content], [result.metadata], result.metadata[""id""]) results = db.similarity_search(query) print(results[0].page_content) ``` However, the `pyvespa` library contains methods to manipulate content on Vespa which you can use directly. #### Deleting documents You can delete documents using the `delete` function: ```python result = db.similarity_search(query) # docs[0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" db.delete([""32""]) result = db.similarity_search(query) # docs[0].metadata[""id""] != ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" ``` Again, the `pyvespa` connection contains methods to delete documents as well. ### Returning with scores The `similarity_search` method only returns the documents in order of relevancy. To retrieve the actual scores: ```python results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query) result = results[0] # result[1] ~= 0.463 ``` This is a result of using the `""all-MiniLM-L6-v2""` embedding model using the cosine distance function (as given by the argument `angular` in the application function). Different embedding functions need different distance functions, and Vespa needs to know which distance function to use when orderings documents. Please refer to the [documentation on distance functions]( for more information. ### As retriever To use this vector store as a [LangChain retriever]( simply call the `as_retriever` function, which is a standard vector store method: ```python db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) retriever = db.as_retriever() query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query) # results[0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" ``` This allows for more general, unstructured, retrieval from the vector store. ### Metadata In the example so far, we\'ve only used the text and the embedding for that text. Documents usually contain additional information, which in LangChain is referred to as metadata. Vespa can contain many fields with different types by adding them to the application package: ```python app_package.schema.add_fields( # ... Field(name=""date"", type=""string"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""]), Field(name=""rating"", type=""int"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""]), Field(name=""author"", type=""string"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary""]), # ... ) vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) ``` We can add some metadata fields in the documents: ```python # Add metadata for i, doc in enumerate(docs): doc.metadata[""date""] = f""2023-{(i % 12)+1}-{(i % 28)+1}"" doc.metadata[""rating""] = range(1, 6)[i % 5] doc.metadata[""author""] = [""Joe Biden"", ""Unknown""][min(i, 1)] ``` And let the Vespa vector store know about these fields: ```python vespa_config.update(dict(metadata_fields=[""date"", ""rating"", ""author""])) ``` Now, when searching for these documents, these fields will be returned. Also, these fields can be filtered on: ```python db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query, filter=""rating > 3"") # results[0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::34"" # results[0].metadata[""author""] == ""Unknown"" ``` ### Custom query If the default behavior of the similarity search does not fit your requirements, you can always provide your own query. Thus, you don\'t need to provide all of the configuration to the vector store, but rather just write this yourself. First, let\'s add a BM25 ranking function to our application: ```python from vespa.package import FieldSet app_package.schema.add_field_set(FieldSet(name=""default"", fields=[""text""])) app_package.schema.add_rank_profile(RankProfile(name=""bm25"", first_phase=""bm25(text)"")) vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) ``` Then, to perform a regular text search based on BM25: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" custom_query = { ""yql"": ""select * from sources * where userQuery()"", ""query"": query, ""type"": ""weakAnd"", ""ranking"": ""bm25"", ""hits"": 4, } results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query, custom_query=custom_query) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""] == ""id:testapp:testapp::32"" # results[0][1] ~= 14.384 ``` All of the powerful search and query capabilities of Vespa can be used by using a custom query. Please refer to the Vespa documentation on it\'s [Query API]( for more details. ### Hybrid search Hybrid search means using both a classic term-based search such as BM25 and a vector search and combining the results. We need to create a new rank profile for hybrid search on Vespa: ```python app_package.schema.add_rank_profile( RankProfile( name=""hybrid"", first_phase=""log(bm25(text)) + 0.5 * closeness(field, embedding)"", inputs=[(""query(query_embedding)"", ""tensor(x[384])"")], ) ) vespa_app = vespa_docker.deploy(application_package=app_package) db = VespaStore.from_documents(docs, embedding_function, app=vespa_app, **vespa_config) ``` Here, we score each document as a combination of it\'s BM25 score and its distance score. We can query using a custom query: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" query_embedding = embedding_function.embed_query(query) nearest_neighbor_expression = ( ""{targetHits: 4}nearestNeighbor(embedding, query_embedding)"" ) custom_query = { ""yql"": f""select * from sources * where {nearest_neighbor_expression} and userQuery()"", ""query"": query, ""type"": ""weakAnd"", ""input.query(query_embedding)"": query_embedding, ""ranking"": ""hybrid"", ""hits"": 4, } results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query, custom_query=custom_query) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""], ""id:testapp:testapp::32"") # results[0][1] ~= 2.897 ``` ### Native embedders in Vespa Up until this point we\'ve used an embedding function in Python to provide embeddings for the texts. Vespa supports embedding function natively, so you can defer this calculation in to Vespa. One benefit is the ability to use GPUs when embedding documents if you have a large collections. Please refer to [Vespa embeddings]( for more information. First, we need to modify our application package: ```python from vespa.package import Component, Parameter app_package.components = [ Component( id=""hf-embedder"", type=""hugging-face-embedder"", parameters=[ Parameter(""transformer-model"", {""path"": ""...""}), Parameter(""tokenizer-model"", {""url"": ""...""}), ], ) ] Field( name=""hfembedding"", type=""tensor(x[384])"", is_document_field=False, indexing=[""input text"", ""embed hf-embedder"", ""attribute"", ""summary""], attribute=[""distance-metric: angular""], ) app_package.schema.add_rank_profile( RankProfile( name=""hf_similarity"", first_phase=""closeness(field, hfembedding)"", inputs=[(""query(query_embedding)"", ""tensor(x[384])"")], ) ) ``` Please refer to the embeddings documentation on adding embedder models and tokenizers to the application. Note that the `hfembedding` field includes instructions for embedding using the `hf-embedder`. Now we can query with a custom query: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" nearest_neighbor_expression = ( ""{targetHits: 4}nearestNeighbor(internalembedding, query_embedding)"" ) custom_query = { ""yql"": f""select * from sources * where {nearest_neighbor_expression}"", ""input.query(query_embedding)"": f\'embed(hf-embedder, ""{query}"")\', ""ranking"": ""internal_similarity"", ""hits"": 4, } results = db.similarity_search_with_score(query, custom_query=custom_query) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""], ""id:testapp:testapp::32"") # results[0][1] ~= 0.630 ``` Note that the query here includes an `embed` instruction to embed the query using the same model as for the documents. ### Approximate nearest neighbor In all of the above examples, we\'ve used exact nearest neighbor to find results. However, for large collections of documents this is not feasible as one has to scan through all documents to find the best matches. To avoid this, we can use [approximate nearest neighbors]( First, we can change the embedding field to create a HNSW index: ```python from vespa.package import HNSW app_package.schema.add_fields( Field( name=""embedding"", type=""tensor(x[384])"", indexing=[""attribute"", ""summary"", ""index""], ann=HNSW( distance_metric=""angular"", max_links_per_node=16, neighbors_to_explore_at_insert=200, ), ) ) ``` This creates a HNSW index on the embedding data which allows for efficient searching. With this set, we can easily search using ANN by setting the `approximate` argument to `True`: ```python query = ""What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"" results = db.similarity_search(query, approximate=True) # results[0][0].metadata[""id""], ""id:testapp:testapp::32"") ``` This covers most of the functionality in the Vespa vector store in LangChain. - [Returning with scores](#returning-with-scores) - [As retriever](#as-retriever) - [Metadata](#metadata) - [Custom query](#custom-query) - [Hybrid search](#hybrid-search) - [Native embedders in Vespa](#native-embedders-in-vespa) - [Approximate nearest neighbor](#approximate-nearest-neighbor)', 'OpenAI assistants | OpenAI assistants The [Assistants API]( allows you to build AI assistants within your own applications. An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API currently supports three types of tools: Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function calling You can interact with OpenAI Assistants using OpenAI tools or custom tools. When using exclusively OpenAI tools, you can just invoke the assistant directly and get final answers. When using custom tools, you can run the assistant and tool execution loop using the built-in AgentExecutor or easily write your own executor. Below we show the different ways to interact with Assistants. As a simple example, let\'s build a math tutor that can write and run code. ### Using only OpenAI tools ```python from langchain.agents.openai_assistant import OpenAIAssistantRunnable ``` ```python interpreter_assistant = OpenAIAssistantRunnable.create_assistant( name=""langchain assistant"", instructions=""You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions."", tools=[{""type"": ""code_interpreter""}], model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"", ) output = interpreter_assistant.invoke({""content"": ""What\'s 10 - 4 raised to the 2.7""}) output ``` ```text [ThreadMessage(id=\'msg_qgxkD5kvkZyl0qOaL4czPFkZ\', assistant_id=\'asst_0T8S7CJuUa4Y4hm1PF6n62v7\', content=[MessageContentText(text=Text(annotations=[], value=\'The result of the calculation \\\\(10 - 4^{2.7}\\\\) is approximately \\\\(-32.224\\\\).\'), type=\'text\')], created_at=1700169519, file_ids=[], metadata={}, object=\'thread.message\', role=\'assistant\', run_id=\'run_aH3ZgSWNk3vYIBQm3vpE8tr4\', thread_id=\'thread_9K6cYfx1RBh0pOWD8SxwVWW9\')] ``` ### As a LangChain agent with arbitrary tools Now let\'s recreate this functionality using our own tools. For this example we\'ll use the [E2B sandbox runtime tool]( ```bash pip install e2b duckduckgo-search ``` ```python import getpass from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun, E2BDataAnalysisTool tools = [E2BDataAnalysisTool(api_key=getpass.getpass()), DuckDuckGoSearchRun()] ``` ```python agent = OpenAIAssistantRunnable.create_assistant( name=""langchain assistant e2b tool"", instructions=""You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions. You can also search the internet."", tools=tools, model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"", as_agent=True, ) ``` #### Using AgentExecutor The OpenAIAssistantRunnable is compatible with the AgentExecutor, so we can pass it in as an agent directly to the executor. The AgentExecutor handles calling the invoked tools and uploading the tool outputs back to the Assistants API. Plus it comes with built-in LangSmith tracing. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools) agent_executor.invoke({""content"": ""What\'s the weather in SF today divided by 2.7""}) ``` ```text {\'content\': ""What\'s the weather in SF today divided by 2.7"", \'output\': ""The search results indicate that the weather in San Francisco is 67 F. Now I will divide this temperature by 2.7 and provide you with the result. Please note that this is a mathematical operation and does not represent a meaningful physical quantity.\\n\\nLet\'s calculate 67 F divided by 2.7.\\nThe result of dividing the current temperature in San Francisco, which is 67 F, by 2.7 is approximately 24.815."", \'thread_id\': \'thread_hcpYI0tfpB9mHa9d95W7nK2B\', \'run_id\': \'run_qOuVmPXS9xlV3XNPcfP8P9W2\'} ``` [LangSmith trace]( Custom execution Or with LCEL we can easily write our own execution loop for running the assistant. This gives us full control over execution. ```python agent = OpenAIAssistantRunnable.create_assistant( name=""langchain assistant e2b tool"", instructions=""You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions."", tools=tools, model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"", as_agent=True, ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.agent import AgentFinish def execute_agent(agent, tools, input): tool_map = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools} response = agent.invoke(input) while not isinstance(response, AgentFinish): tool_outputs = [] for action in response: tool_output = tool_map[action.tool].invoke(action.tool_input) print(action.tool, action.tool_input, tool_output, end=""\\n\\n"") tool_outputs.append( {""output"": tool_output, ""tool_call_id"": action.tool_call_id} ) response = agent.invoke( { ""tool_outputs"": tool_outputs, ""run_id"": action.run_id, ""thread_id"": action.thread_id, } ) return response ``` ```python response = execute_agent(agent, tools, {""content"": ""What\'s 10 - 4 raised to the 2.7""}) print(response.return_values[""output""]) ``` ```text e2b_data_analysis {\'python_code\': \'result = 10 - 4 ** 2.7\\nprint(result)\'} {""stdout"": ""-32.22425314473263"", ""stderr"": """", ""artifacts"": []} \\( 10 - 4^{2.7} \\) equals approximately -32.224. ``` ## Using existing Thread To use an existing thread we just need to pass the ""thread_id"" in when invoking the agent. ```python next_response = execute_agent( agent, tools, {""content"": ""now add 17.241"", ""thread_id"": response.return_values[""thread_id""]}, ) print(next_response.return_values[""output""]) ``` ```text e2b_data_analysis {\'python_code\': \'result = 10 - 4 ** 2.7 + 17.241\\nprint(result)\'} {""stdout"": ""-14.983253144732629"", ""stderr"": """", ""artifacts"": []} \\( 10 - 4^{2.7} + 17.241 \\) equals approximately -14.983. ``` ## Using existing Assistant To use an existing Assistant we can initialize the `OpenAIAssistantRunnable` directly with an `assistant_id`. ```python agent = OpenAIAssistantRunnable(assistant_id="""", as_agent=True) ``` - [Using only OpenAI tools](#using-only-openai-tools) - [As a LangChain agent with arbitrary tools](#as-a-langchain-agent-with-arbitrary-tools) - [Using existing Thread](#using-existing-thread) - [Using existing Assistant](#using-existing-assistant)', 'Dynamically route logic based on input | Dynamically route logic based on input This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language. Routing allows you to create non-deterministic chains where the output of a previous step defines the next step. Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs. There are two ways to perform routing: 1. Using a `RunnableBranch`. 2. Writing custom factory function that takes the input of a previous step and returns a **runnable**. Importantly, this should return a **runnable** and NOT actually execute. We\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain. ## Using a RunnableBranch A `RunnableBranch` is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable. Here\'s an example of what it looks like in action: ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser ``` First, let\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`: ```python chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`. Do not respond with more than one word. {question} Classification:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I call Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text \' Anthropic\' ``` Now, let\'s create three sub chains: ```python langchain_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in langchain. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Harrison Chase told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) anthropic_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""You are an expert in anthropic. \\ Always answer questions starting with ""As Dario Amodei told me"". \\ Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) general_chain = ( PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Respond to the following question: Question: {question} Answer:"""""" ) | ChatAnthropic() ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch branch = RunnableBranch( (lambda x: ""anthropic"" in x[""topic""].lower(), anthropic_chain), (lambda x: ""langchain"" in x[""topic""].lower(), langchain_chain), general_chain, ) ``` ```python full_chain = {""topic"": chain, ""question"": lambda x: x[""question""]} | branch ``` ```python full_chain.invoke({""question"": ""how do I use Anthropic?""}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content="" As Dario Amodei told me, here are some ways to use Anthropic:\\n\\n- Sign up for an account on Anthropic\'s website to access tools like Claude, Constitutional AI, and Writer. \\n\\n- Use Claude for tasks like email generation, customer service chat, and QA.

[Sign up here]( to get on the waitlist. ## Overview `LangServe` helps developers deploy `LangChain` [runnables and chains]( as a REST API. This library is integrated with [FastAPI]( and uses [pydantic]( for data validation. In addition, it provides a client that can be used to call into runnables deployed on a server. A javascript client is available in [LangChainJS]( ## Features - Input and Output schemas automatically inferred from your LangChain object, and enforced on every API call, with rich error messages - API docs page with JSONSchema and Swagger (insert example link) - Efficient `/invoke`, `/batch` and `/stream` endpoints with support for many concurrent requests on a single server - `/stream_log` endpoint for streaming all (or some) intermediate steps from your chain/agent - Playground page at `/playground` with streaming output and intermediate steps - Built-in (optional) tracing to [LangSmith]( just add your API key (see [Instructions]( - All built with battle-tested open-source Python libraries like FastAPI, Pydantic, uvloop and asyncio. - Use the client SDK to call a LangServe server as if it was a Runnable running locally (or call the HTTP API directly) - [LangServe Hub]( ### Limitations - Client callbacks are not yet supported for events that originate on the server - OpenAPI docs will not be generated when using Pydantic V2. Fast API does not support [mixing pydantic v1 and v2 namespaces]( See section below for more details. ## Hosted LangServe We will be releasing a hosted version of LangServe for one-click deployments of LangChain applications. [Sign up here]( to get on the waitlist. ## Security - Vulnerability in Versions 0.0.13 - 0.0.15 -- playground endpoint allows accessing arbitrary files on server. [Resolved in 0.0.16]( ## Installation For both client and server: ```bash pip install ""langserve[all]"" ``` or `pip install ""langserve[client]""` for client code, and `pip install ""langserve[server]""` for server code. ## LangChain CLI Use the `LangChain` CLI to bootstrap a `LangServe` project quickly. To use the langchain CLI make sure that you have a recent version of `langchain-cli` installed. You can install it with `pip install -U langchain-cli`. ```sh langchain app new ../path/to/directory ``` ## Examples Get your LangServe instance started quickly with [LangChain Templates]( For more examples, see the templates [index]( or the [examples]( directory. ### Server Here\'s a server that deploys an OpenAI chat model, an Anthropic chat model, and a chain that uses the Anthropic model to tell a joke about a topic. ```python #!/usr/bin/env python from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI from langserve import add_routes app = FastAPI( title=""LangChain Server"", version=""1.0"", description=""A simple api server using Langchain\'s Runnable interfaces"", ) add_routes( app, ChatOpenAI(), path=""/openai"", ) add_routes( app, ChatAnthropic(), path=""/anthropic"", ) model = ChatAnthropic() prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""tell me a joke about {topic}"") add_routes( app, prompt | model, path=""/joke"", ) if __name__ == ""__main__"": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, host=""localhost"", port=8000) ``` ### Docs If you\'ve deployed the server above, you can view the generated OpenAPI docs using: If using pydantic v2, docs will not be generated for invoke/batch/stream/stream_log.

Index page `/` is not defined by **design**, so `curl localhost:8000` or visiting the URL will return a 404. If you want content at `/` define an endpoint `@app.get(""/"")`. ### Client Python SDK ```python from langchain.schema import SystemMessage, HumanMessage from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableMap from langserve import RemoteRunnable openai = RemoteRunnable("" anthropic = RemoteRunnable("" joke_chain = RemoteRunnable("" joke_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""parrots""}) # or async await joke_chain.ainvoke({""topic"": ""parrots""}) prompt = [ SystemMessage(content=\'Act like either a cat or a parrot.\'), HumanMessage(content=\'Hello!\') ] # Supports astream async for msg in anthropic.astream(prompt): print(msg, end="""", flush=True) prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [(""system"", ""Tell me a long story about {topic}"")] ) # Can define custom chains chain = prompt | RunnableMap({ ""openai"": openai, ""anthropic"": anthropic, }) chain.batch([{ ""topic"": ""parrots"" }, { ""topic"": ""cats"" }]) ``` In TypeScript (requires LangChain.js version 0.0.166 or later): ```typescript import { RemoteRunnable } from ""langchain/runnables/remote""; const chain = new RemoteRunnable({ url: ` }); const result = await chain.invoke({ topic: ""cats"", }); ``` Python using `requests`: ```python import requests response = requests.post( "" json={\'input\': {\'topic\': \'cats\'}} ) response.json() ``` You can also use `curl`: ```sh curl --location --request POST \' \\ --header \'Content-Type: application/json\' \\ --data-raw \'{ ""input"": { ""topic"": ""cats"" } }\' ``` ## Endpoints The following code: ```python ... add_routes( app, runnable, path=""/my_runnable"", ) ``` adds of these endpoints to the server: - `POST /my_runnable/invoke` - invoke the runnable on a single input - `POST /my_runnable/batch` - invoke the runnable on a batch of inputs - `POST /my_runnable/stream` - invoke on a single input and stream the output - `POST /my_runnable/stream_log` - invoke on a single input and stream the output, including output of intermediate steps as it\'s generated - `GET /my_runnable/input_schema` - json schema for input to the runnable - `GET /my_runnable/output_schema` - json schema for output of the runnable - `GET /my_runnable/config_schema` - json schema for config of the runnable These endpoints match the [LangChain Expression Language interface]( -- please reference this documentation for more details. ## Playground You can find a playground page for your runnable at `/my_runnable/playground`. This exposes a simple UI to [configure]( and invoke your runnable with streaming output and intermediate steps. ![]( ### Widgets The playground supports [widgets](#playground-widgets) and can be used to test your runnable with different inputs. In addition, for configurable runnables, the playground will allow you to configure the runnable and share a link with the configuration: ### Sharing ![]( ## Legacy Chains LangServe works with both Runnables (constructed via [LangChain Expression Language]( and legacy chains (inheriting from `Chain`). However, some of the input schemas for legacy chains may be incomplete/incorrect, leading to errors. This can be fixed by updating the `input_schema` property of those chains in LangChain. If you encounter any errors, please open an issue on THIS repo, and we will work to address it. ## Deployment ### Deploy to GCP You can deploy to GCP Cloud Run using the following command: ```text gcloud run deploy [your-service-name] --source . --port 8001 --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1 --set-env-vars=OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key ``` ## Pydantic LangServe provides support for Pydantic 2 with some limitations. 1. OpenAPI docs will not be generated for invoke/batch/stream/stream_log when using Pydantic V2. Fast API does not support [mixing pydantic v1 and v2 namespaces] . 2. LangChain uses the v1 namespace in Pydantic v2. Please read the [following guidelines to ensure compatibility with LangChain]( Except for these limitations, we expect the API endpoints, the playground and any other features to work as expected. ## Advanced ## Handling Authentication If you need to add authentication to your server, please reference FastAPI\'s [security documentation]( and [middleware documentation]( ### Files LLM applications often deal with files. There are different architectures that can be made to implement file processing; at a high level: 1. The file may be uploaded to the server via a dedicated endpoint and processed using a separate endpoint 2. The file may be uploaded by either value (bytes of file) or reference (e.g., s3 url to file content) 3. The processing endpoint may be blocking or non-blocking 4. If significant processing is required, the processing may be offloaded to a dedicated process pool You should determine what is the appropriate architecture for your application. Currently, to upload files by value to a runnable, use base64 encoding for the file (`multipart/form-data` is not supported yet). Here\'s an [example]( that shows how to use base64 encoding to send a file to a remote runnable. Remember, you can always upload files by reference (e.g., s3 url) or upload them as multipart/form-data to a dedicated endpoint. ### Custom Input and Output Types Input and Output types are defined on all runnables. You can access them via the `input_schema` and `output_schema` properties. `LangServe` uses these types for validation and documentation. If you want to override the default inferred types, you can use the `with_types` method. Here\'s a toy example to illustrate the idea: ```python from typing import Any from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda app = FastAPI() def func(x: Any) -> int: """"""Mistyped function that should accept an int but accepts anything."""""" return x + 1 runnable = RunnableLambda(func).with_types( input_schema=int, ) add_routes(app, runnable) ``` ### Custom User Types Inherit from `CustomUserType` if you want the data to de-serialize into a pydantic model rather than the equivalent dict representation. At the moment, this type only works _server_ side and is used to specify desired _decoding_ behavior. If inheriting from this type the server will keep the decoded type as a pydantic model instead of converting it into a dict. ```python from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda from langserve import add_routes from langserve.schema import CustomUserType app = FastAPI() class Foo(CustomUserType): bar: int def func(foo: Foo) -> int: """"""Sample function that expects a Foo type which is a pydantic model"""""" assert isinstance(foo, Foo) return foo.bar # Note that the input and output type are automatically inferred! # You do not need to specify them. # runnable = RunnableLambda(func).with_types( # <-- Not needed in this case # input_schema=Foo, # output_schema=int, # add_routes(app, RunnableLambda(func), path=""/foo"") ``` ### Playground Widgets\u200b The playground allows you to define custom widgets for your runnable from the backend. - A widget is specified at the field level and shipped as part of the JSON schema of the input type - A widget must contain a key called `type` with the value being one of a well known list of widgets - Other widget keys will be associated with values that describe paths in a JSON object General schema: ```typescript type JsonPath = number | string | (number | string)[]; type NameSpacedPath = { title: string; path: JsonPath }; // Using title to mimick json schema, but can use namespace type OneOfPath = { oneOf: JsonPath[] }; type Widget = { type: string // Some well known type (e.g., base64file, chat etc.) [key: string]: JsonPath | NameSpacedPath | OneOfPath; }; ``` #### File Upload Widget\u200b Allows creation of a file upload input in the UI playground for files that are uploaded as base64 encoded strings. Here\'s the full [example]( Snippet: ```python try: from pydantic.v1 import Field except ImportError: from pydantic import Field from langserve import CustomUserType # ATTENTION: Inherit from CustomUserType instead of BaseModel otherwise # the server will decode it into a dict instead of a pydantic model. class FileProcessingRequest(CustomUserType): """"""Request including a base64 encoded file."""""" # The extra field is used to specify a widget for the playground UI. file: str = Field(..., extra={""widget"": {""type"": ""base64file""}}) num_chars: int = 100 ``` Example widget: ![]( - [Overview](#overview) - [Features](#features)- [Limitations](#limitations) - [Hosted LangServe](#hosted-langserve) - [Security](#security) - [Installation](#installation) - [LangChain CLI ](#langchain-cli-) - [Examples](#examples)- [Server](#server) - [Docs](#docs) - [Client](#client) - [Endpoints](#endpoints) - [Playground](#playground)- [Widgets](#widgets) - [Sharing](#sharing) - [Legacy Chains](#legacy-chains) - [Deployment](#deployment)- [Deploy to GCP](#deploy-to-gcp) - [Pydantic](#pydantic) - [Advanced](#advanced) - [Handling Authentication](#handling-authentication)- [Files](#files) - [Custom Input and Output Types](#custom-input-and-output-types) - [Custom User Types](#custom-user-types) - [Playground Widgets](#playground-widgets)']",LangServe is a library that helps developers deploy LangChain runnables and chains as a REST API.,"LangServe is an easy way to deploy any LangChain runnable, chain, or agent.

58,What's a string evaluator,"[""String Evaluators | String Evaluators A string evaluator is a component within LangChain designed to assess the performance of a language model by comparing its generated outputs (predictions) to a reference string or an input. This comparison is a crucial step in the evaluation of language models, providing a measure of the accuracy or quality of the generated text. In practice, string evaluators are typically used to evaluate a predicted string against a given input, such as a question or a prompt. Often, a reference label or context string is provided to define what a correct or ideal response would look like. These evaluators can be customized to tailor the evaluation process to fit your application's specific requirements. To create a custom string evaluator, inherit from the `StringEvaluator` class and implement the `_evaluate_strings` method. If you require asynchronous support, also implement the `_aevaluate_strings` method. Here's a summary of the key attributes and methods associated with a string evaluator: - `evaluation_name`: Specifies the name of the evaluation. - `requires_input`: Boolean attribute that indicates whether the evaluator requires an input string. If True, the evaluator will raise an error when the input isn't provided. If False, a warning will be logged if an input _is_ provided, indicating that it will not be considered in the evaluation. - `requires_reference`: Boolean attribute specifying whether the evaluator requires a reference label. If True, the evaluator will raise an error when the reference isn't provided. If False, a warning will be logged if a reference _is_ provided, indicating that it will not be considered in the evaluation. String evaluators also implement the following methods: - `aevaluate_strings`: Asynchronously evaluates the output of the Chain or Language Model, with support for optional input and label. - `evaluate_strings`: Synchronously evaluates the output of the Chain or Language Model, with support for optional input and label. The following sections provide detailed information on available string evaluator implementations as well as how to create a custom string evaluator.

In this example, you will make a simple trajectory evaluator that uses an LLM to determine if any actions were unnecessary. ```python from typing import Any, Optional, Sequence, Tuple from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.evaluation import AgentTrajectoryEvaluator from langchain.schema import AgentAction class StepNecessityEvaluator(AgentTrajectoryEvaluator): """"""Evaluate the perplexity of a predicted string."""""" def __init__(self) -> None: llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"", temperature=0.0) template = """"""Are any of the following steps unnecessary in answering {input}? Provide the verdict on a new line as a single ""Y"" for yes or ""N"" for no. DATA ------ Steps: {trajectory} ------ Verdict:"""""" self.chain = LLMChain.from_string(llm, template) def _evaluate_agent_trajectory( self, *, prediction: str, input: str, agent_trajectory: Sequence[Tuple[AgentAction, str]], reference: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs: Any, ) -> dict: vals = [ f""{i}: Action=[{action.tool}] returned observation = [{observation}]"" for i, (action, observation) in enumerate(agent_trajectory) ] trajectory = ""\\n"".join(vals) response = self.chain.run(dict(trajectory=trajectory, input=input), **kwargs) decision = response.split(""\\n"")[-1].strip() score = 1 if decision == ""Y"" else 0 return {""score"": score, ""value"": decision, ""reasoning"": response} ``` The example above will return a score of 1 if the language model predicts that any of the actions were unnecessary, and it returns a score of 0 if all of them were predicted to be necessary. It returns the string \'decision\' as the \'value\', and includes the rest of the generated text as \'reasoning\' to let you audit the decision. You can call this evaluator to grade the intermediate steps of your agent\'s trajectory. ```python evaluator = StepNecessityEvaluator() evaluator.evaluate_agent_trajectory( prediction=""The answer is pi"", input=""What is today?"", agent_trajectory=[ ( AgentAction(tool=""ask"", tool_input=""What is today?"", log=""""), ""tomorrow\'s yesterday"", ), ( AgentAction(tool=""check_tv"", tool_input=""Watch tv for half hour"", log=""""), ""bzzz"", ), ], ) ``` ```text {\'score\': 1, \'value\': \'Y\', \'reasoning\': \'Y\'} ```', 'Criteria Evaluation | Criteria Evaluation []( In scenarios where you wish to assess a model\'s output using a specific rubric or criteria set, the `criteria` evaluator proves to be a handy tool. It allows you to verify if an LLM or Chain\'s output complies with a defined set of criteria. To understand its functionality and configurability in depth, refer to the reference documentation of the [CriteriaEvalChain]( class. ### Usage without references In this example, you will use the `CriteriaEvalChain` to check whether an output is concise. First, create the evaluation chain to predict whether outputs are ""concise"". ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", criteria=""conciseness"") # This is equivalent to loading using the enum from langchain.evaluation import EvaluatorType evaluator = load_evaluator(EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'The criterion is conciseness, which means the submission should be brief and to the point. \\n\\nLooking at the submission, the answer to the question ""What\\\'s 2+2?"" is indeed ""four"". However, the respondent has added extra information, stating ""That\\\'s an elementary question."" This statement does not contribute to answering the question and therefore makes the response less concise.\\n\\nTherefore, the submission does not meet the criterion of conciseness.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` #### Output Format All string evaluators expose an [evaluate_strings]( (or async [aevaluate_strings]( method, which accepts: - input (str) The input to the agent. - prediction (str) The predicted response. The criteria evaluators return a dictionary with the following values: - score: Binary integer 0 to 1, where 1 would mean that the output is compliant with the criteria, and 0 otherwise - value: A ""Y"" or ""N"" corresponding to the score - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Using Reference Labels Some criteria (such as correctness) require reference labels to work correctly. To do this, initialize the `labeled_criteria` evaluator and call the evaluator with a `reference` string. ```python evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"") # We can even override the model\'s learned knowledge using ground truth labels eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( input=""What is the capital of the US?"", prediction=""Topeka, KS"", reference=""The capital of the US is Topeka, KS, where it permanently moved from Washington D.C. on May 16, 2023"", ) print(f\'With ground truth: {eval_result[""score""]}\') ``` ```text With ground truth: 1 ``` **Default Criteria** Most of the time, you\'ll want to define your own custom criteria (see below), but we also provide some common criteria you can load with a single string. Here\'s a list of pre-implemented criteria. Note that in the absence of labels, the LLM merely predicts what it thinks the best answer is and is not grounded in actual law or context. ```python from langchain.evaluation import Criteria # For a list of other default supported criteria, try calling `supported_default_criteria` list(Criteria) ``` ```text [, , , , , , , , , , ] ``` ## Custom Criteria To evaluate outputs against your own custom criteria, or to be more explicit the definition of any of the default criteria, pass in a dictionary of `""criterion_name"": ""criterion_description""` Note: it\'s recommended that you create a single evaluator per criterion. This way, separate feedback can be provided for each aspect. Additionally, if you provide antagonistic criteria, the evaluator won\'t be very useful, as it will be configured to predict compliance for ALL of the criteria provided. ```python custom_criterion = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric or mathematical information?"" } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criterion, ) query = ""Tell me a joke"" prediction = ""I ate some square pie but I don\'t know the square of pi."" eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(eval_result) # If you wanted to specify multiple criteria. Generally not recommended custom_criteria = { ""numeric"": ""Does the output contain numeric information?"", ""mathematical"": ""Does the output contain mathematical information?"", ""grammatical"": ""Is the output grammatically correct?"", ""logical"": ""Is the output logical?"", } eval_chain = load_evaluator( EvaluatorType.CRITERIA, criteria=custom_criteria, ) eval_result = eval_chain.evaluate_strings(prediction=prediction, input=query) print(""Multi-criteria evaluation"") print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': ""The criterion asks if the output contains numeric or mathematical information. The joke in the submission does contain mathematical information. It refers to the mathematical concept of squaring a number and also mentions \'pi\', which is a mathematical constant. Therefore, the submission does meet the criterion.\\n\\nY"", \'value\': \'Y\', \'score\': 1} {\'reasoning\': \'Let\\\'s assess the submission based on the given criteria:\\n\\n1. Numeric: The output does not contain any explicit numeric information. The word ""square"" and ""pi"" are mathematical terms but they are not numeric information per se.\\n\\n2. Mathematical: The output does contain mathematical information. The terms ""square"" and ""pi"" are mathematical terms. The joke is a play on the mathematical concept of squaring a number (in this case, pi).\\n\\n3. Grammatical: The output is grammatically correct. The sentence structure, punctuation, and word usage are all correct.\\n\\n4. Logical: The output is logical. It makes sense within the context of the joke.

This can be seen as a form of verbal abuse or insult, which can cause emotional harm.\\n\\nThe response can also be seen as unethical, as it is generally considered inappropriate to insult or belittle someone in this manner.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Configuring the LLM If you don\'t specify an eval LLM, the `load_evaluator` method will initialize a `gpt-4` LLM to power the grading chain. Below, use an anthropic model instead. ```python # %pip install ChatAnthropic # %env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""criteria"", llm=llm, criteria=""conciseness"") ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Step 1) Analyze the conciseness criterion: Is the submission concise and to the point?\\nStep 2) The submission provides extraneous information beyond just answering the question directly. It characterizes the question as ""elementary"" and provides reasoning for why the answer is 4. This additional commentary makes the submission not fully concise.\\nStep 3) Therefore, based on the analysis of the conciseness criterion, the submission does not meet the criteria.\\n\\nN\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` # Configuring the Prompt If you want to completely customize the prompt, you can initialize the evaluator with a custom prompt template as follows. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate fstring = """"""Respond Y or N based on how well the following response follows the specified rubric. Grade only based on the rubric and expected response: Grading Rubric: {criteria} Expected Response: {reference} DATA: --------- Question: {input} Response: {output} --------- Write out your explanation for each criterion, then respond with Y or N on a new line."""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(fstring) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_criteria"", criteria=""correctness"", prompt=prompt) ``` ```python eval_result = evaluator.evaluate_strings( prediction=""What\'s 2+2? That\'s an elementary question. The answer you\'re looking for is that two and two is four."", input=""What\'s 2+2?"", reference=""It\'s 17 now."", ) print(eval_result) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Correctness: No, the response is not correct. The expected response was ""It\\\'s 17 now."" but the response given was ""What\\\'s 2+2? That\\\'s an elementary question. The answer you\\\'re looking for is that two and two is four.""\', \'value\': \'N\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Conclusion In these examples, you used the `CriteriaEvalChain` to evaluate model outputs against custom criteria, including a custom rubric and constitutional principles. Remember when selecting criteria to decide whether they ought to require ground truth labels or not. Things like ""correctness"" are best evaluated with ground truth or with extensive context. Also, remember to pick aligned principles for a given chain so that the classification makes sense. - [Usage without references](#usage-without-references) - [Using Reference Labels](#using-reference-labels) - [Custom Criteria](#custom-criteria) - [Using Constitutional Principles](#using-constitutional-principles) - [Configuring the LLM](#configuring-the-llm) - [Conclusion](#conclusion)']",A string evaluator assesses the performance of a language model by comparing its generated outputs to a reference string or input.,A string evaluator in LangChain is an object that assesses the performance of a language model's predicted response by comparing it to an input string and/or reference string.,0.9999999999666667,1.0,1.0,0.22460703508977375,0.588235294117647

Below are two examples of showing how to avoid mixing pydantic v1 and v2 code in the case of inheritance and in the case of passing objects to LangChain. **Example 1: Extending via inheritance** **YES** ```python from pydantic.v1 import root_validator, validator class CustomTool(BaseTool): # BaseTool is v1 code x: int = Field(default=1) def _run(*args, **kwargs): return ""hello"" @validator(\'x\') # v1 code @classmethod def validate_x(cls, x: int) -> int: return 1 CustomTool( name=\'custom_tool\', description=""hello"", x=1, ) ``` Mixing Pydantic v2 primitives with Pydantic v1 primitives can raise cryptic errors **NO** ```python from pydantic import Field, field_validator # pydantic v2 class CustomTool(BaseTool): # BaseTool is v1 code x: int = Field(default=1) def _run(*args, **kwargs): return ""hello"" @field_validator(\'x\') # v2 code @classmethod def validate_x(cls, x: int) -> int: return 1 CustomTool( name=\'custom_tool\', description=""hello"", x=1, ) ``` **Example 2: Passing objects to LangChain** **YES** ```python from langchain.tools.base import Tool from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel, Field # <-- Uses v1 namespace class CalculatorInput(BaseModel): question: str = Field() Tool.from_function( # <-- tool uses v1 namespace func=lambda question: \'hello\', name=""Calculator"", description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"", args_schema=CalculatorInput ) ``` **NO** ```python from langchain.tools.base import Tool from pydantic import BaseModel, Field # <-- Uses v2 namespace class CalculatorInput(BaseModel): question: str = Field() Tool.from_function( # <-- tool uses v1 namespace func=lambda question: \'hello\', name=""Calculator"", description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"", args_schema=CalculatorInput ) ``` - [LangChain Pydantic migration plan](#langchain-pydantic-migration-plan)', 'LangServe | LangServe []( []( []( []( We will be releasing a hosted version of LangServe for one-click deployments of LangChain applications. [Sign up here]( to get on the waitlist. ## Overview `LangServe` helps developers deploy `LangChain` [runnables and chains]( as a REST API. This library is integrated with [FastAPI]( and uses [pydantic]( for data validation. In addition, it provides a client that can be used to call into runnables deployed on a server. A javascript client is available in [LangChainJS]( ## Features - Input and Output schemas automatically inferred from your LangChain object, and enforced on every API call, with rich error messages - API docs page with JSONSchema and Swagger (insert example link) - Efficient `/invoke`, `/batch` and `/stream` endpoints with support for many concurrent requests on a single server - `/stream_log` endpoint for streaming all (or some) intermediate steps from your chain/agent - Playground page at `/playground` with streaming output and intermediate steps - Built-in (optional) tracing to [LangSmith]( just add your API key (see [Instructions]( - All built with battle-tested open-source Python libraries like FastAPI, Pydantic, uvloop and asyncio. - Use the client SDK to call a LangServe server as if it was a Runnable running locally (or call the HTTP API directly) - [LangServe Hub]( ### Limitations - Client callbacks are not yet supported for events that originate on the server - OpenAPI docs will not be generated when using Pydantic V2. Fast API does not support [mixing pydantic v1 and v2 namespaces]( See section below for more details. ## Hosted LangServe We will be releasing a hosted version of LangServe for one-click deployments of LangChain applications. [Sign up here]( to get on the waitlist. ## Security - Vulnerability in Versions 0.0.13 - 0.0.15 -- playground endpoint allows accessing arbitrary files on server. [Resolved in 0.0.16]( ## Installation For both client and server: ```bash pip install ""langserve[all]"" ``` or `pip install ""langserve[client]""` for client code, and `pip install ""langserve[server]""` for server code. ## LangChain CLI Use the `LangChain` CLI to bootstrap a `LangServe` project quickly. To use the langchain CLI make sure that you have a recent version of `langchain-cli` installed. You can install it with `pip install -U langchain-cli`. ```sh langchain app new ../path/to/directory ``` ## Examples Get your LangServe instance started quickly with [LangChain Templates]( For more examples, see the templates [index]( or the [examples]( directory. ### Server Here\'s a server that deploys an OpenAI chat model, an Anthropic chat model, and a chain that uses the Anthropic model to tell a joke about a topic. ```python #!/usr/bin/env python from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI from langserve import add_routes app = FastAPI( title=""LangChain Server"", version=""1.0"", description=""A simple api server using Langchain\'s Runnable interfaces"", ) add_routes( app, ChatOpenAI(), path=""/openai"", ) add_routes( app, ChatAnthropic(), path=""/anthropic"", ) model = ChatAnthropic() prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""tell me a joke about {topic}"") add_routes( app, prompt | model, path=""/joke"", ) if __name__ == ""__main__"": import uvicorn uvicorn.run(app, host=""localhost"", port=8000) ``` ### Docs If you\'ve deployed the server above, you can view the generated OpenAPI docs using: If using pydantic v2, docs will not be generated for invoke/batch/stream/stream_log. See [Pydantic](#pydantic) section below for more details. ```sh curl localhost:8000/docs ``` make sure to **add** the `/docs` suffix. Index page `/` is not defined by **design**, so `curl localhost:8000` or visiting the URL will return a 404. If you want content at `/` define an endpoint `@app.get(""/"")`. ### Client Python SDK ```python from langchain.schema import SystemMessage, HumanMessage from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableMap from langserve import RemoteRunnable openai = RemoteRunnable("" anthropic = RemoteRunnable("" joke_chain = RemoteRunnable("" joke_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""parrots""}) # or async await joke_chain.ainvoke({""topic"": ""parrots""}) prompt = [ SystemMessage(content=\'Act like either a cat or a parrot.\'), HumanMessage(content=\'Hello!\') ] # Supports astream async for msg in anthropic.astream(prompt): print(msg, end="""", flush=True) prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [(""system"", ""Tell me a long story about {topic}"")] ) # Can define custom chains chain = prompt | RunnableMap({ ""openai"": openai, ""anthropic"": anthropic, }) chain.batch([{ ""topic"": ""parrots"" }, { ""topic"": ""cats"" }]) ``` In TypeScript (requires LangChain.js version 0.0.166 or later): ```typescript import { RemoteRunnable } from ""langchain/runnables/remote""; const chain = new RemoteRunnable({ url: ` }); const result = await chain.invoke({ topic: ""cats"", }); ``` Python using `requests`: ```python import requests response = requests.post( "" json={\'input\': {\'topic\': \'cats\'}} ) response.json() ``` You can also use `curl`: ```sh curl --location --request POST \' \\ --header \'Content-Type: application/json\' \\ --data-raw \'{ ""input"": { ""topic"": ""cats"" } }\' ``` ## Endpoints The following code: ```python ... add_routes( app, runnable, path=""/my_runnable"", ) ``` adds of these endpoints to the server: - `POST /my_runnable/invoke` - invoke the runnable on a single input - `POST /my_runnable/batch` - invoke the runnable on a batch of inputs - `POST /my_runnable/stream` - invoke on a single input and stream the output - `POST /my_runnable/stream_log` - invoke on a single input and stream the output, including output of intermediate steps as it\'s generated - `GET /my_runnable/input_schema` - json schema for input to the runnable - `GET /my_runnable/output_schema` - json schema for output of the runnable - `GET /my_runnable/config_schema` - json schema for config of the runnable These endpoints match the [LangChain Expression Language interface]( -- please reference this documentation for more details. ## Playground You can find a playground page for your runnable at `/my_runnable/playground`. This exposes a simple UI to [configure]( and invoke your runnable with streaming output and intermediate steps. ![]( ### Widgets The playground supports [widgets](#playground-widgets) and can be used to test your runnable with different inputs. In addition, for configurable runnables, the playground will allow you to configure the runnable and share a link with the configuration: ### Sharing ![]( ## Legacy Chains LangServe works with both Runnables (constructed via [LangChain Expression Language]( and legacy chains (inheriting from `Chain`). However, some of the input schemas for legacy chains may be incomplete/incorrect, leading to errors. This can be fixed by updating the `input_schema` property of those chains in LangChain. If you encounter any errors, please open an issue on THIS repo, and we will work to address it. ## Deployment ### Deploy to GCP You can deploy to GCP Cloud Run using the following command: ```text gcloud run deploy [your-service-name] --source . --port 8001 --allow-unauthenticated --region us-central1 --set-env-vars=OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key ``` ## Pydantic LangServe provides support for Pydantic 2 with some limitations. 1. OpenAPI docs will not be generated for invoke/batch/stream/stream_log when using Pydantic V2. Fast API does not support [mixing pydantic v1 and v2 namespaces] . 2. LangChain uses the v1 namespace in Pydantic v2. Please read the [following guidelines to ensure compatibility with LangChain]( Except for these limitations, we expect the API endpoints, the playground and any other features to work as expected. ## Advanced ## Handling Authentication If you need to add authentication to your server, please reference FastAPI\'s [security documentation]( and [middleware documentation]( ### Files LLM applications often deal with files. There are different architectures that can be made to implement file processing; at a high level: 1. The file may be uploaded to the server via a dedicated endpoint and processed using a separate endpoint 2. The file may be uploaded by either value (bytes of file) or reference (e.g., s3 url to file content) 3. The processing endpoint may be blocking or non-blocking 4. If significant processing is required, the processing may be offloaded to a dedicated process pool You should determine what is the appropriate architecture for your application. Currently, to upload files by value to a runnable, use base64 encoding for the file (`multipart/form-data` is not supported yet). Here\'s an [example]( that shows how to use base64 encoding to send a file to a remote runnable. Remember, you can always upload files by reference (e.g., s3 url) or upload them as multipart/form-data to a dedicated endpoint. ### Custom Input and Output Types Input and Output types are defined on all runnables. You can access them via the `input_schema` and `output_schema` properties. `LangServe` uses these types for validation and documentation. If you want to override the default inferred types, you can use the `with_types` method. Here\'s a toy example to illustrate the idea: ```python from typing import Any from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda app = FastAPI() def func(x: Any) -> int: """"""Mistyped function that should accept an int but accepts anything."""""" return x + 1 runnable = RunnableLambda(func).with_types( input_schema=int, ) add_routes(app, runnable) ``` ### Custom User Types Inherit from `CustomUserType` if you want the data to de-serialize into a pydantic model rather than the equivalent dict representation. At the moment, this type only works _server_ side and is used to specify desired _decoding_ behavior. If inheriting from this type the server will keep the decoded type as a pydantic model instead of converting it into a dict. ```python from fastapi import FastAPI from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda from langserve import add_routes from langserve.schema import CustomUserType app = FastAPI() class Foo(CustomUserType): bar: int def func(foo: Foo) -> int: """"""Sample function that expects a Foo type which is a pydantic model"""""" assert isinstance(foo, Foo) return foo.bar # Note that the input and output type are automatically inferred! # You do not need to specify them. # runnable = RunnableLambda(func).with_types( # <-- Not needed in this case # input_schema=Foo, # output_schema=int, # add_routes(app, RunnableLambda(func), path=""/foo"") ``` ### Playground Widgets\u200b The playground allows you to define custom widgets for your runnable from the backend. - A widget is specified at the field level and shipped as part of the JSON schema of the input type - A widget must contain a key called `type` with the value being one of a well known list of widgets - Other widget keys will be associated with values that describe paths in a JSON object General schema: ```typescript type JsonPath = number | string | (number | string)[]; type NameSpacedPath = { title: string; path: JsonPath }; // Using title to mimick json schema, but can use namespace type OneOfPath = { oneOf: JsonPath[] }; type Widget = { type: string // Some well known type (e.g., base64file, chat etc.) [key: string]: JsonPath | NameSpacedPath | OneOfPath; }; ``` #### File Upload Widget\u200b Allows creation of a file upload input in the UI playground for files that are uploaded as base64 encoded strings. Here\'s the full [example]( Snippet: ```python try: from pydantic.v1 import Field except ImportError: from pydantic import Field from langserve import CustomUserType # ATTENTION: Inherit from CustomUserType instead of BaseModel otherwise # the server will decode it into a dict instead of a pydantic model. class FileProcessingRequest(CustomUserType): """"""Request including a base64 encoded file."""""" # The extra field is used to specify a widget for the playground UI. file: str = Field(..., extra={""widget"": {""type"": ""base64file""}}) num_chars: int = 100 ``` Example widget: ![]( - [Overview](#overview) - [Features](#features)- [Limitations](#limitations) - [Hosted LangServe](#hosted-langserve) - [Security](#security) - [Installation](#installation) - [LangChain CLI ](#langchain-cli-) - [Examples](#examples)- [Server](#server) - [Docs](#docs) - [Client](#client) - [Endpoints](#endpoints) - [Playground](#playground)- [Widgets](#widgets) - [Sharing](#sharing) - [Legacy Chains](#legacy-chains) - [Deployment](#deployment)- [Deploy to GCP](#deploy-to-gcp) - [Pydantic](#pydantic) - [Advanced](#advanced) - [Handling Authentication](#handling-authentication)- [Files](#files) - [Custom Input and Output Types](#custom-input-and-output-types) - [Custom User Types](#custom-user-types) - [Playground Widgets](#playground-widgets)', 'Marqo | Marqo This page covers how to use the Marqo ecosystem within LangChain. ### What is Marqo? Marqo is a tensor search engine that uses embeddings stored in in-memory HNSW indexes to achieve cutting edge search speeds. Marqo can scale to hundred-million document indexes with horizontal index sharding and allows for async and non-blocking data upload and search. Marqo uses the latest machine learning models from PyTorch, Huggingface, OpenAI and more. You can start with a pre-configured model or bring your own. The built in ONNX support and conversion allows for faster inference and higher throughput on both CPU and GPU. Because Marqo include its own inference your documents can have a mix of text and images, you can bring Marqo indexes with data from your other systems into the langchain ecosystem without having to worry about your embeddings being compatible. Deployment of Marqo is flexible, you can get started yourself with our docker image or [contact us about our managed cloud offering!]( To run Marqo locally with our docker image, [see our getting started.]( ## Installation and Setup - Install the Python SDK with `pip install marqo` ## Wrappers ### VectorStore There exists a wrapper around Marqo indexes, allowing you to use them within the vectorstore framework. Marqo lets you select from a range of models for generating embeddings and exposes some preprocessing configurations. The Marqo vectorstore can also work with existing multimodel indexes where your documents have a mix of images and text, for more information refer to [our documentation]( Note that instaniating the Marqo vectorstore with an existing multimodal index will disable the ability to add any new documents to it via the langchain vectorstore `add_texts` method. To import this vectorstore: ```python from langchain.vectorstores import Marqo ``` For a more detailed walkthrough of the Marqo wrapper and some of its unique features, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/marqo) - [What is Marqo?](#what-is-marqo) - [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) - [Wrappers](#wrappers)- [VectorStore](#vectorstore)']","No, LangChain is currently compatible with Pydantic v1.","As of langchain>=0.0.267, LangChain will allow users to install either Pydantic V1 or V2, though it internally will use pydantic V1.",0.99999999995,1.0,0.5,0.018231997294962367,0.1875

In an API call, you can describe functions and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. The goal of the OpenAI Function APIs is to more reliably return valid and useful function calls than a generic text completion or chat API.

To start, we will set up the retriever we want to use, and then turn it into a retriever tool. Next, we will use the high level constructor for this type of agent. Finally, we will walk through how to construct a conversational retrieval agent from components. ## The Retriever To start, we need a retriever to use! The code here is mostly just example code. Feel free to use your own retriever and skip to the section on creating a retriever tool. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader loader = TextLoader(""../../../../../docs/docs/modules/state_of_the_union.txt"") ``` ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS documents = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0) texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents) embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() db = FAISS.from_documents(texts, embeddings) ``` ```python retriever = db.as_retriever() ``` ## Retriever Tool Now we need to create a tool for our retriever. The main things we need to pass in are a name for the retriever as well as a description. These will both be used by the language model, so they should be informative. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool ``` ```python tool = create_retriever_tool( retriever, ""search_state_of_union"", ""Searches and returns documents regarding the state-of-the-union."", ) tools = [tool] ``` ## Agent Constructor Here, we will use the high level `create_conversational_retrieval_agent` API to construct the agent. Notice that beside the list of tools, the only thing we need to pass in is a language model to use. Under the hood, this agent is using the OpenAIFunctionsAgent, so we need to use an ChatOpenAI model. ```python from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_conversational_retrieval_agent ``` ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python agent_executor = create_conversational_retrieval_agent(llm, tools, verbose=True) ``` We can now try it out! ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""hi, im bob""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... Hello Bob! How can I assist you today? > Finished chain. ``` ```python result[""output""] ``` ```text \'Hello Bob!

Let\'s take a look so we can understand how to modify going forward. There are a few components: - The memory - The prompt template - The agent - The agent executor ```python # This is needed for both the memory and the prompt memory_key = ""history"" ``` ### The Memory In this example, we want the agent to remember not only previous conversations, but also previous intermediate steps. For that, we can use `AgentTokenBufferMemory`. Note that if you want to change whether the agent remembers intermediate steps, or how the long the buffer is, or anything like that you should change this part. ```python from langchain.agents.openai_functions_agent.agent_token_buffer_memory import ( AgentTokenBufferMemory, ) memory = AgentTokenBufferMemory(memory_key=memory_key, llm=llm) ``` ## The Prompt Template For the prompt template, we will use the `OpenAIFunctionsAgent` default way of creating one, but pass in a system prompt and a placeholder for memory. ```python from langchain.agents.openai_functions_agent.base import OpenAIFunctionsAgent from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder from langchain.schema.messages import SystemMessage ``` ```python system_message = SystemMessage( content=( ""Do your best to answer the questions. "" ""Feel free to use any tools available to look up "" ""relevant information, only if necessary"" ) ) ``` ```python prompt = OpenAIFunctionsAgent.create_prompt( system_message=system_message, extra_prompt_messages=[MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=memory_key)], ) ``` ## The Agent We will use the OpenAIFunctionsAgent ```python agent = OpenAIFunctionsAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools, prompt=prompt) ``` ## The Agent Executor Importantly, we pass in `return_intermediate_steps=True` since we are recording that with our memory object ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor( agent=agent, tools=tools, memory=memory, verbose=True, return_intermediate_steps=True, ) ``` ```python result = agent_executor({""input"": ""hi, im bob""}) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Remembrall gives your language model long-term memory, retrieval augmented generation, and complete observability with just a few lines of code. ![Remembrall Dashboard](/assets/images/RemembrallDashboard-36b4f535ae0718f2f5923084caf111de.png) It works as a light-weight proxy on top of your OpenAI calls and simply augments the context of the chat calls at runtime with relevant facts that have been collected. ## Setup To get started, [sign in with Github on the Remembrall platform]( and copy your [API key from the settings page]( Any request that you send with the modified `openai_api_base` (see below) and Remembrall API key will automatically be tracked in the Remembrall dashboard. You **never** have to share your OpenAI key with our platform and this information is **never** stored by the Remembrall systems. ### Enable Long Term Memory In addition to setting the `openai_api_base` and Remembrall API key via `x-gp-api-key`, you should specify a UID to maintain memory for. This will usually be a unique user identifier (like email). ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI chat_model = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_base="" model_kwargs={ ""headers"":{ ""x-gp-api-key"": ""remembrall-api-key-here"", ""x-gp-remember"": ""user@email.com"", } }) chat_model.predict(""My favorite color is blue."") import time; time.sleep(5) # wait for system to save fact via auto save print(chat_model.predict(""What is my favorite color?"")) ``` ### Enable Retrieval Augmented Generation First, create a document context in the [Remembrall dashboard]( Paste in the document texts or upload documents as PDFs to be processed.

But, retrieval may produce different results with subtle changes in query wording or if the embeddings do not capture the semantics of the data well. Prompt engineering / tuning is sometimes done to manually address these problems, but can be tedious. The `MultiQueryRetriever` automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents. By generating multiple perspectives on the same question, the `MultiQueryRetriever` might be able to overcome some of the limitations of the distance-based retrieval and get a richer set of results. ```python # Build a sample vectorDB from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma # Load blog post loader = WebBaseLoader("" data = loader.load() # Split text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(data) # VectorDB embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings() vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=embedding) ``` #### Simple usage Specify the LLM to use for query generation, and the retriever will do the rest. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetriever question = ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) retriever_from_llm = MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm( retriever=vectordb.as_retriever(), llm=llm ) ``` ```python # Set logging for the queries import logging logging.basicConfig() logging.getLogger(""langchain.retrievers.multi_query"").setLevel(logging.INFO) ``` ```python unique_docs = retriever_from_llm.get_relevant_documents(query=question) len(unique_docs) ``` ```text INFO:langchain.retrievers.multi_query:Generated queries: [\'1.

RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer: ``` We\'ll use the [LCEL Runnable]( protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box ```python from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python for chunk in rag_chain.stream(""What is Task Decomposition?""): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Task decomposition can be performed by AI models with prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ### Go deeper #### Choosing LLMs `ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model wrapper.

There are two main things we need to do to support this. 1. Add a messages placeholder to our chain which allows us to pass in historical messages 2. Add a chain that takes the latest user query and reformulates it in the context of the chat history into a standalone question that can be passed to our retriever. Let\'s start with 2.

Do NOT answer the question, \\ just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."""""" condense_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", condense_q_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) condense_q_chain = condense_q_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""What is meant by large"", } ) ``` ```text \'What is the definition of ""large"" in the context of a language model?\' ``` ```python condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""How do transformers work"", } ) ``` ```text \'How do transformer models function?\' ``` And now we can build our full QA chain.

- Generation","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a process that involves retrieving external data and using it in the generation step of language models. LangChain provides various building blocks for RAG applications. Here are some ways of doing retrieval augmented generation:

- Document loaders: LangChain offers over 100 document loaders to load documents from different sources, including private S3 buckets and public websites.
- Document transformers: These help in fetching relevant parts of documents by splitting or chunking large documents into smaller chunks.
- Text embedding models: LangChain integrates with over 25 different embedding providers and methods to create embeddings for documents, allowing efficient similarity-based retrieval.
- Vector stores: With the rise of embeddings, LangChain supports over 50 vector stores for efficient storage and searching of embeddings.
- Retrievers: LangChain supports various retrieval algorithms, including semantic search, parent document retriever, self-query retriever, ensemble retriever, and more, to retrieve the data from the database.

It provides several benefits for building applications:

- Async, Batch, and Streaming Support: LCEL chains have full sync, async, batch, and streaming support, making it easy to prototype in a Jupyter notebook and then expose it as an async streaming interface.
- Fallbacks: LCEL allows you to easily attach fallbacks to any chain, handling errors gracefully.
- Parallelism: LCEL syntax automatically runs components that can be run in parallel.
- Seamless LangSmith Tracing Integration: LCEL logs all steps to LangSmith for observability and debuggability. [0]

LCEL provides an intuitive and readable syntax for composition and supports streaming, async calls, batching, parallelization, retries, and more. It allows you to combine different components, such as prompts, models, and output parsers, to build powerful applications. LCEL chains can be called synchronously or asynchronously, and they support intermediate result access, input/output schemas, and tracing with LangSmith.

There are multiple use cases where this is beneficial. LangChain has a base `MultiVectorRetriever` which makes querying this type of setup easy. A lot of the complexity lies in how to create the multiple vectors per document. This notebook covers some of the common ways to create those vectors and use the `MultiVectorRetriever`. The methods to create multiple vectors per document include: - Smaller chunks: split a document into smaller chunks, and embed those (this is ParentDocumentRetriever). - Summary: create a summary for each document, embed that along with (or instead of) the document. - Hypothetical questions: create hypothetical questions that each document would be appropriate to answer, embed those along with (or instead of) the document. Note that this also enables another method of adding embeddings - manually. This is great because you can explicitly add questions or queries that should lead to a document being recovered, giving you more control. ```python from langchain.retrievers.multi_vector import MultiVectorRetriever ``` ```python from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.storage import InMemoryStore from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loaders = [ TextLoader(""../../paul_graham_essay.txt""), TextLoader(""../../state_of_the_union.txt""), ] docs = [] for l in loaders: docs.extend(l.load()) text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=10000) docs = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ## Smaller chunks Often times it can be useful to retrieve larger chunks of information, but embed smaller chunks. This allows for embeddings to capture the semantic meaning as closely as possible, but for as much context as possible to be passed downstream. Note that this is what the `ParentDocumentRetriever` does. Here we show what is going on under the hood. ```python # The vectorstore to use to index the child chunks vectorstore = Chroma( collection_name=""full_documents"", embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddings() ) # The storage layer for the parent documents store = InMemoryStore() id_key = ""doc_id"" # The retriever (empty to start) retriever = MultiVectorRetriever( vectorstore=vectorstore, docstore=store, id_key=id_key, ) import uuid doc_ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in docs] ``` ```python # The splitter to use to create smaller chunks child_text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=400) ``` ```python sub_docs = [] for i, doc in enumerate(docs): _id = doc_ids[i] _sub_docs = child_text_splitter.split_documents([doc]) for _doc in _sub_docs: _doc.metadata[id_key] = _id sub_docs.extend(_sub_docs) ``` ```python retriever.vectorstore.add_documents(sub_docs) retriever.docstore.mset(list(zip(doc_ids, docs))) ``` ```python # Vectorstore alone retrieves the small chunks retriever.vectorstore.similarity_search(""justice breyer"")[0] ``` ```text Document(page_content=\'Tonight, I\'d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyeran Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

68,What is an agent,"['ReAct | ReAct This walkthrough showcases using an agent to implement the [ReAct]( logic. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` First, let\'s load the language model we\'re going to use to control the agent. ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) ``` Next, let\'s load some tools to use. Note that the `llm-math` tool uses an LLM, so we need to pass that in. ```python tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm) ``` ## Using LCEL We will first show how to create the agent using LCEL ```python from langchain import hub from langchain.agents.format_scratchpad import format_log_to_str from langchain.agents.output_parsers import ReActSingleInputOutputParser from langchain.tools.render import render_text_description ``` ```python prompt = hub.pull(""hwchase17/react"") prompt = prompt.partial( tools=render_text_description(tools), tool_names="", "".join([t.name for t in tools]), ) ``` ```python llm_with_stop = llm.bind(stop=[""\\nObservation""]) ``` ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_log_to_str(x[""intermediate_steps""]), } | prompt | llm_with_stop | ReActSingleInputOutputParser() ) ``` ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` ```python agent_executor.invoke( { ""input"": ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?

The main difference here is a different prompt. We will use JSON to encode the agent\'s actions (chat models are a bit tougher to steet, so using JSON helps to enforce the output format). ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python chat_model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ```python prompt = hub.pull(""hwchase17/react-json"") prompt = prompt.partial( tools=render_text_description(tools), tool_names="", "".join([t.name for t in tools]), ) ``` ```python chat_model_with_stop = chat_model.bind(stop=[""\\nObservation""]) ``` ```python from langchain.agents.output_parsers import ReActJsonSingleInputOutputParser ``` ```python agent = ( { ""input"": lambda x: x[""input""], ""agent_scratchpad"": lambda x: format_log_to_str(x[""intermediate_steps""]), } | prompt | chat_model_with_stop | ReActJsonSingleInputOutputParser() ) ``` ```python agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True) ``` ```python agent_executor.invoke( { ""input"": ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?"" } ) ``` We can also use an off-the-shelf agent class ```python agent = initialize_agent( tools, chat_model, agent=AgentType.CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?

An Assistant has instructions and can leverage models, tools, and knowledge to respond to user queries. The Assistants API currently supports three types of tools: Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function calling You can interact with OpenAI Assistants using OpenAI tools or custom tools. When using exclusively OpenAI tools, you can just invoke the assistant directly and get final answers. When using custom tools, you can run the assistant and tool execution loop using the built-in AgentExecutor or easily write your own executor. Below we show the different ways to interact with Assistants. As a simple example, let\'s build a math tutor that can write and run code. ### Using only OpenAI tools ```python from langchain.agents.openai_assistant import OpenAIAssistantRunnable ``` ```python interpreter_assistant = OpenAIAssistantRunnable.create_assistant( name=""langchain assistant"", instructions=""You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions."", tools=[{""type"": ""code_interpreter""}], model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"", ) output = interpreter_assistant.invoke({""content"": ""What\'s 10 - 4 raised to the 2.7""}) output ``` ```text [ThreadMessage(id=\'msg_qgxkD5kvkZyl0qOaL4czPFkZ\', assistant_id=\'asst_0T8S7CJuUa4Y4hm1PF6n62v7\', content=[MessageContentText(text=Text(annotations=[], value=\'The result of the calculation \\\\(10 - 4^{2.7}\\\\) is approximately \\\\(-32.224\\\\).\'), type=\'text\')], created_at=1700169519, file_ids=[], metadata={}, object=\'thread.message\', role=\'assistant\', run_id=\'run_aH3ZgSWNk3vYIBQm3vpE8tr4\', thread_id=\'thread_9K6cYfx1RBh0pOWD8SxwVWW9\')] ``` ### As a LangChain agent with arbitrary tools Now let\'s recreate this functionality using our own tools. For this example we\'ll use the [E2B sandbox runtime tool]( ```bash pip install e2b duckduckgo-search ``` ```python import getpass from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun, E2BDataAnalysisTool tools = [E2BDataAnalysisTool(api_key=getpass.getpass()), DuckDuckGoSearchRun()] ``` ```python agent = OpenAIAssistantRunnable.create_assistant( name=""langchain assistant e2b tool"", instructions=""You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions. You can also search the internet."", tools=tools, model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"", as_agent=True, ) ``` #### Using AgentExecutor The OpenAIAssistantRunnable is compatible with the AgentExecutor, so we can pass it in as an agent directly to the executor. The AgentExecutor handles calling the invoked tools and uploading the tool outputs back to the Assistants API. Plus it comes with built-in LangSmith tracing. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools) agent_executor.invoke({""content"": ""What\'s the weather in SF today divided by 2.7""}) ``` ```text {\'content\': ""What\'s the weather in SF today divided by 2.7"", \'output\': ""The search results indicate that the weather in San Francisco is 67 F.

This gives us full control over execution. ```python agent = OpenAIAssistantRunnable.create_assistant( name=""langchain assistant e2b tool"", instructions=""You are a personal math tutor. Write and run code to answer math questions."", tools=tools, model=""gpt-4-1106-preview"", as_agent=True, ) ``` ```python from langchain.schema.agent import AgentFinish def execute_agent(agent, tools, input): tool_map = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools} response = agent.invoke(input) while not isinstance(response, AgentFinish): tool_outputs = [] for action in response: tool_output = tool_map[action.tool].invoke(action.tool_input) print(action.tool, action.tool_input, tool_output, end=""\\n\\n"") tool_outputs.append( {""output"": tool_output, ""tool_call_id"": action.tool_call_id} ) response = agent.invoke( { ""tool_outputs"": tool_outputs, ""run_id"": action.run_id, ""thread_id"": action.thread_id, } ) return response ``` ```python response = execute_agent(agent, tools, {""content"": ""What\'s 10 - 4 raised to the 2.7""}) print(response.return_values[""output""]) ``` ```text e2b_data_analysis {\'python_code\': \'result = 10 - 4 ** 2.7\\nprint(result)\'} {""stdout"": ""-32.22425314473263"", ""stderr"": """", ""artifacts"": []} \\( 10 - 4^{2.7} \\) equals approximately -32.224. ``` ## Using existing Thread To use an existing thread we just need to pass the ""thread_id"" in when invoking the agent. ```python next_response = execute_agent( agent, tools, {""content"": ""now add 17.241"", ""thread_id"": response.return_values[""thread_id""]}, ) print(next_response.return_values[""output""]) ``` ```text e2b_data_analysis {\'python_code\': \'result = 10 - 4 ** 2.7 + 17.241\\nprint(result)\'} {""stdout"": ""-14.983253144732629"", ""stderr"": """", ""artifacts"": []} \\( 10 - 4^{2.7} + 17.241 \\) equals approximately -14.983. ``` ## Using existing Assistant To use an existing Assistant we can initialize the `OpenAIAssistantRunnable` directly with an `assistant_id`. ```python agent = OpenAIAssistantRunnable(assistant_id="""", as_agent=True) ``` - [Using only OpenAI tools](#using-only-openai-tools) - [As a LangChain agent with arbitrary tools](#as-a-langchain-agent-with-arbitrary-tools) - [Using existing Thread](#using-existing-thread) - [Using existing Assistant](#using-existing-assistant)']",An agent in this context is an automated system that uses tools to perform tasks based on user input.,An agent is a component in the Langchain framework that uses a language model (LLM) to determine which actions to take and in what order.

To use, you should have the redis python package installed and have a running Redis Enterprise or Redis-Stack server For production use cases, it is recommended to use Redis Enterprise as the scaling, performance, stability and availability is much better than Redis-Stack. For testing and prototyping, however, this is not required. Redis-Stack is available as a docker container the full vector search API available. # to run redis stack in docker locally docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest Once running, you can connect to the redis server with the following url schemas: - redis://: # simple connection - redis://:@: # connection with authentication - rediss://: # connection with SSL - rediss://:@: # connection with SSL and auth Examples: The following examples show various ways to use the Redis VectorStore with LangChain. For all the following examples assume we have the following imports: from langchain.vectorstores import Redis from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings Initialize, create index, and load Documentsfrom langchain.vectorstores import Redis from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings rds = Redis.from_documents( documents, # a list of Document objects from loaders or created embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize, create index, and load Documents with metadatards = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize, create index, and load Documents with metadata and return keys rds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) For use cases where the index needs to stay alive, you can initialize with an index name such that it\'s easier to reference later rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_name=""my-index"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize and connect to an existing index (from above) rds = Redis.from_existing_index( embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_name=""my-index"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Advanced examples: Custom vector schema can be supplied to change the way that Redis creates the underlying vector schema. This is useful for production use cases where you want to optimize the vector schema for your use case. ex. using HNSW instead of FLAT (knn) which is the default vector_schema = { ""algorithm"": ""HNSW"" } rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object vector_schema=vector_schema, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Custom index schema can be supplied to change the way that the metadata is indexed. This is useful for you would like to use the hybrid querying (filtering) capability of Redis. By default, this implementation will automatically generate the index schema according to the following rules: All strings are indexed as text fields All numbers are indexed as numeric fields All lists of strings are indexed as tag fields (joined bylangchain.vectorstores.redis.constants.REDIS_TAG_SEPARATOR) All None values are not indexed but still stored in Redis these arenot retrievable through the interface here, but the raw Redis client can be used to retrieve them. All other types are not indexed To override these rules, you can pass in a custom index schema like the following tag: - name: credit_score text: - name: user - name: job Typically, the credit_score field would be a text field since it\'s a string, however, we can override this behavior by specifying the field type as shown with the yaml config (can also be a dictionary) above and the code below. rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_schema=""path/to/index_schema.yaml"", # can also be a dictionary redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) When connecting to an existing index where a custom schema has been applied, it\'s important to pass in the same schema to the from_existing_index method. Otherwise, the schema for newly added samples will be incorrect and metadata will not be returned. Initialize with necessary components.

Last updated on Nov 17, 2023. Show this page source', 'Redis | Redis [Redis (Remote Dictionary Server)]( is an open-source in-memory storage, used as a distributed, in-memory keyvalue database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Because it holds all data in memory and because of its design, `Redis` offers low-latency reads and writes, making it particularly suitable for use cases that require a cache. Redis is the most popular NoSQL database, and one of the most popular databases overall. This page covers how to use the [Redis]( ecosystem within LangChain. It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Redis wrappers. ## Installation and Setup Install the Python SDK: ```bash pip install redis ``` ## Wrappers All wrappers need a redis url connection string to connect to the database support either a stand alone Redis server or a High-Availability setup with Replication and Redis Sentinels. ### Redis Standalone connection url For standalone `Redis` server, the official redis connection url formats can be used as describe in the python redis modules ""from_url()"" method [Redis.from_url]( Example: `redis_url = ""redis://:secret-pass@localhost:6379/0""` ### Redis Sentinel connection url For [Redis sentinel setups]( the connection scheme is ""redis+sentinel"". This is an unofficial extensions to the official IANA registered protocol schemes as long as there is no connection url for Sentinels available. Example: `redis_url = ""redis+sentinel://:secret-pass@sentinel-host:26379/mymaster/0""` The format is `redis+sentinel://[[username]:[password]]@[host-or-ip]:[port]/[service-name]/[db-number]` with the default values of ""service-name = mymaster"" and ""db-number = 0"" if not set explicit. The service-name is the redis server monitoring group name as configured within the Sentinel. The current url format limits the connection string to one sentinel host only (no list can be given) and booth Redis server and sentinel must have the same password set (if used). ### Redis Cluster connection url Redis cluster is not supported right now for all methods requiring a ""redis_url"" parameter. The only way to use a Redis Cluster is with LangChain classes accepting a preconfigured Redis client like `RedisCache` (example below). ### Cache The Cache wrapper allows for [Redis]( to be used as a remote, low-latency, in-memory cache for LLM prompts and responses. #### Standard Cache The standard cache is the Redis bread & butter of use case in production for both [open-source]( and [enterprise]( users globally. To import this cache: ```python from langchain.cache import RedisCache ``` To use this cache with your LLMs: ```python from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache import redis redis_client = redis.Redis.from_url(...) set_llm_cache(RedisCache(redis_client)) ``` #### Semantic Cache Semantic caching allows users to retrieve cached prompts based on semantic similarity between the user input and previously cached results. Under the hood it blends Redis as both a cache and a vectorstore. To import this cache: ```python from langchain.cache import RedisSemanticCache ``` To use this cache with your LLMs: ```python from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache import redis # use any embedding provider... from tests.integration_tests.vectorstores.fake_embeddings import FakeEmbeddings redis_url = ""redis://localhost:6379"" set_llm_cache(RedisSemanticCache( embedding=FakeEmbeddings(), redis_url=redis_url )) ``` ### VectorStore The vectorstore wrapper turns Redis into a low-latency [vector database]( for semantic search or LLM content retrieval. To import this vectorstore: ```python from langchain.vectorstores import Redis ``` For a more detailed walkthrough of the Redis vectorstore wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/redis). ### Retriever The Redis vector store retriever wrapper generalizes the vectorstore class to perform low-latency document retrieval. To create the retriever, simply call `.as_retriever()` on the base vectorstore class. ### Memory Redis can be used to persist LLM conversations. #### Vector Store Retriever Memory For a more detailed walkthrough of the `VectorStoreRetrieverMemory` wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/modules/memory/types/vectorstore_retriever_memory). #### Chat Message History Memory For a detailed example of Redis to cache conversation message history, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/memory/redis_chat_message_history). - [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) - [Wrappers](#wrappers)- [Redis Standalone connection url](#redis-standalone-connection-url) - [Redis Sentinel connection url](#redis-sentinel-connection-url) - [Redis Cluster connection url](#redis-cluster-connection-url) - [Cache](#cache) - [VectorStore](#vectorstore) - [Retriever](#retriever) - [Memory](#memory)', 'Text splitting by header | Text splitting by header Text splitting for vector storage often uses sentences or other delimiters [to keep related text together]( But many documents (such as `Markdown` files) have structure (headers) that can be explicitly used in splitting. The `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` lets a user split `Markdown` files files based on specified headers. This results in chunks that retain the header(s) that it came from in the metadata. This works nicely w/ `SelfQueryRetriever`. First, tell the retriever about our splits. Then, query based on the doc structure (e.g., ""summarize the doc introduction""). Chunks only from that section of the Document will be filtered and used in chat / Q+A. Let\'s test this out on an [example Notion page]( First, I download the page to Markdown as explained [here]( ```python # Load Notion page as a markdownfile file from langchain.document_loaders import NotionDirectoryLoader path = ""../Notion_DB/"" loader = NotionDirectoryLoader(path) docs = loader.load() md_file = docs[0].page_content ``` ```python # Let\'s create groups based on the section headers in our page from langchain.text_splitter import MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter headers_to_split_on = [ (""###"", ""Section""), ] markdown_splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(headers_to_split_on=headers_to_split_on) md_header_splits = markdown_splitter.split_text(md_file) ``` Now, perform text splitting on the header grouped documents. ```python # Define our text splitter from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter chunk_size = 500 chunk_overlap = 0 text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=chunk_size, chunk_overlap=chunk_overlap ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(md_header_splits) ``` This sets us up well do perform metadata filtering based on the document structure. Let\'s bring this all together by building a vectorstore first. ```bash pip install chromadb ``` ```python # Build vectorstore and keep the metadata from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` Let\'s create a `SelfQueryRetriever` that can filter based upon metadata we defined. ```python # Create retriever from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever # Define our metadata metadata_field_info = [ AttributeInfo( name=""Section"", description=""Part of the document that the text comes from"", type=""string or list[string]"", ), ] document_content_description = ""Major sections of the document"" # Define self query retriever llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm( llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True ) ``` We can see that we can query _only for texts_ in the `Introduction` of the document! ```python # Test retriever.get_relevant_documents(""Summarize the Introduction section of the document"") ``` ```text query=\'Introduction\' filter=Comparison(comparator=, attribute=\'Section\', value=\'Introduction\') limit=None [Document(page_content=\'![Untitled](Auto-Evaluation%20of%20Metadata%20Filtering%2018502448c85240828f33716740f9574b/Untitled.png)\', metadata={\'Section\': \'Introduction\'}), Document(page_content=\'Q+A systems often use a two-step approach: retrieve relevant text chunks and then synthesize them into an answer.

The ability to retain document structure for metadata filtering can be helpful for complicated or longer documents. ```python from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm, retriever=retriever) qa_chain.run(""Summarize the Testing section of the document"") ``` ```text query=\'Testing\' filter=Comparison(comparator=, attribute=\'Section\', value=\'Testing\') limit=None \'The Testing section of the document describes the evaluation of the `SelfQueryRetriever` component in comparison to a baseline model. The evaluation was performed on a test case where the query was broken down into a semantic query and a metadata filter. The results showed that the `SelfQueryRetriever` component was able to perform the transformation between query and metadata format, but failed to filter using the episode ID in the query. The baseline model returned documents from three different episodes, which confused the answer. The `SelfQueryRetriever` component was deemed to work well in many cases and will be used in retrieval.\' ```']",Use `filter` parameter in search methods.,"To perform a similarity search with metadata filtering in LangChain using the Redis vectorstore, you can use Redis filter expressions.

Subclasses should override this method if they can batch more efficiently; e.g., if the underlying runnable uses an API which supports a batch mode. async agenerate(prompts: List[str], stop: Optional[List[str]] = None, callbacks: Union[List[BaseCallbackHandler], BaseCallbackManager, None, List[Optional[Union[List[BaseCallbackHandler], BaseCallbackManager]]]] = None, *, tags: Optional[Union[List[str], List[List[str]]]] = None, metadata: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], List[Dict[str, Any]]]] = None, run_name: Optional[Union[str, List[str]]] = None, **kwargs: Any) → LLMResult¶ Run the LLM on the given prompt and input. async agenerate_prompt(prompts: List[PromptValue], stop: Optional[List[str]] = None, callbacks: Union[List[BaseCallbackHandler], BaseCallbackManager, None, List[Optional[Union[List[BaseCallbackHandler], BaseCallbackManager]]]] = None, **kwargs: Any) → LLMResult¶ Asynchronously pass a sequence of prompts and return model generations. This method should make use of batched calls for models that expose a batched API. Use this method when you want to: take advantage of batched calls, need more output from the model than just the top generated value, are building chains that are agnostic to the underlying language modeltype (e.g., pure text completion models vs chat models). Parameters prompts – List of PromptValues. A PromptValue is an object that can be converted to match the format of any language model (string for pure text generation models and BaseMessages for chat models). stop – Stop words to use when generating. Model output is cut off at the first occurrence of any of these substrings. callbacks – Callbacks to pass through. Used for executing additional functionality, such as logging or streaming, throughout generation. **kwargs – Arbitrary additional keyword arguments. These are usually passed to the model provider API call. Returns An LLMResult, which contains a list of candidate Generations for each inputprompt and additional model provider-specific output. async ainvoke(input: Union[PromptValue, str, List[BaseMessage]], config: Optional[RunnableConfig] = None, *, stop: Optional[List[str]] = None, **kwargs: Any) → str¶ Default implementation of ainvoke, calls invoke from a thread. The default implementation allows usage of async code even if the runnable did not implement a native async version of invoke. Subclasses should override this method if they can run asynchronously. async apredict(text: str, *, stop: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None, **kwargs: Any) → str¶ Asynchronously pass a string to the model and return a string prediction. Use this method when calling pure text generation models and only the topcandidate generation is needed. Parameters text – String input to pass to the model. stop – Stop words to use when generating. Model output is cut off at the first occurrence of any of these substrings. **kwargs – Arbitrary additional keyword arguments. These are usually passed to the model provider API call. Returns Top model prediction as a string. async apredict_messages(messages: List[BaseMessage], *, stop: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None, **kwargs: Any) → BaseMessage¶ Asynchronously pass messages to the model and return a message prediction. Use this method when calling chat models and only the topcandidate generation is needed. Parameters messages – A sequence of chat messages corresponding to a single model input. stop – Stop words to use when generating. Model output is cut off at the first occurrence of any of these substrings. **kwargs – Arbitrary additional keyword arguments. These are usually passed to the model provider API call. Returns Top model prediction as a message. async astream(input: Union[PromptValue, str, List[BaseMessage]], config: Optional[RunnableConfig] = None, *, stop: Optional[List[str]] = None, **kwargs: Any) → AsyncIterator[str]¶ Default implementation of astream, which calls ainvoke. Subclasses should override this method if they support streaming output. async astream_log(input: Any, config: Optional[RunnableConfig] = None, *, diff: bool = True, include_names: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None, include_types: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None, include_tags: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None, exclude_names: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None, exclude_types: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None, exclude_tags: Optional[Sequence[str]] = None, **kwargs: Optional[Any]) → Union[AsyncIterator[RunLogPatch], AsyncIterator[RunLog]]¶ Stream all output from a runnable, as reported to the callback system. This includes all inner runs of LLMs, Retrievers, Tools, etc. Output is streamed as Log objects, which include a list of jsonpatch ops that describe how the state of the run has changed in each step, and the final state of the run. The jsonpatch ops can be applied in order to construct state. async atransform(input: AsyncIterator[Input], config: Optional[RunnableConfig] = None, **kwargs: Optional[Any]) → AsyncIterator[Output]¶ Default implementation of atransform, which buffers input and calls astream. Subclasses should override this method if they can start producing output while input is still being generated. batch(inputs: List[Union[PromptValue, str, List[BaseMessage]]], config: Optional[Union[RunnableConfig, List[RunnableConfig]]] = None, *, return_exceptions: bool = False, **kwargs: Any) → List[str]¶ Default implementation runs invoke in parallel using a thread pool executor.

How do i fix this. I just bought it last week.\\nI restored as manufactures cleaned up the screen\\nthe problem continues\\n\\n## 27 Answers\\n\\nFilter by: \\n\\nMost Helpful\\nNewest\\nOldest\\n\\n### Accepted Answer\\nHi,\\nWhere did you buy it? If you bought it from Apple or from an official retailer like Carphone warehouse etc. Then you\\\'ll have a year warranty and can get it replaced free.\\nIf you bought it second hand, from a third part repair shop or online, then it may still have warranty, unless it is refurbished and has been repaired elsewhere.\\nIf this is the case, it may be the screen that needs replacing to solve your issue.\\nEither way, wherever you got it, it\\\'s best to return it and get a refund or a replacement device. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n### Most Helpful Answer\\nI had the same issues, screen freezing, opening apps by itself, selecting the screens and typing on it\\\'s own. I first suspected aliens and then ghosts and then hackers.\\niPhone 6 is weak physically and tend to bend on pressure. And my phone had no case or cover.\\nI took the phone to apple stores and they said sensors need to be replaced and possibly screen replacement as well. My phone is just 17 months old.\\nHere is what I did two days ago and since then it is working like a charm..\\nHold the phone in portrait (as if watching a movie). Twist it very very gently. do it few times.Rest the phone for 10 mins (put it on a flat surface). You can now notice those self typing things gone and screen getting stabilized.\\nThen, reset the hardware (hold the power and home button till the screen goes off and comes back with apple logo). release the buttons when you see this.\\nThen, connect to your laptop and log in to iTunes and reset your phone completely. (please take a back-up first).\\nAnd your phone should be good to use again.\\nWhat really happened here for me is that the sensors might have stuck to the screen and with mild twisting, they got disengaged/released.\\nI posted this in Apple Community and the moderators deleted it, for the best reasons known to them.\\nInstead of throwing away your phone (or selling cheaply), try this and you could be saving your phone.\\nLet me know how it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIt was the charging cord! I bought a gas station braided cord and it was the culprit. Once I plugged my OEM cord into the phone the GHOSTS went away.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI\\\'ve same issue that I just get resolved. I first tried to restore it from iCloud back, however it was not a software issue or any virus issue, so after restore same problem continues. Then I get my phone to local area iphone repairing lab, and they detected that it is an LCD issue. LCD get out of order without any reason (It was neither hit or nor slipped, but LCD get out of order all and sudden, while using it) it started opening things at random. I get LCD replaced with new one, that cost me $80.00 in total ($70.00 LCD charges + $10.00 as labor charges to fix it). iPhone is back to perfect mode now. It was iphone 6s. Thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI was having the same issue with my 6 plus, I took it to a repair shop, they opened the phone, disconnected the three ribbons the screen has, blew up and cleaned the connectors and connected the screen again and it solved the issue it\'s hardware, not software.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHey.\\nJust had this problem now. As it turns out, you just need to plug in your phone. I use a case and when I took it off I noticed that there was a lot of dust and dirt around the areas that the case didn\\\'t cover. I shined a light in my ports and noticed they were filled with dust. Tomorrow I plan on using pressurized air to clean it out and the problem should be solved. If you plug in your phone and unplug it and it stops the issue, I recommend cleaning your phone thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI simply changed the power supply and problem was gone. The block that plugs in the wall not the sub cord. The cord was fine but not the block.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nSomeone ask! I purchased my iPhone 6s Plus for 1000 from at&t. Before I touched it, I purchased a otter defender case. I read where at&t said touch desease was due to dropping! Bullshit!! I am 56 I have never dropped it!! Looks brand new! Never dropped or abused any way! I have my original charger. I am going to clean it and try everyone\'s advice. It really sucks! I had 40,000,000 on my heart of Vegas slots! I play every day. I would be spinning and my fingers were no where max buttons and it would light up and switch to max. It did it 3 times before I caught it light up by its self. It sucks. Hope I can fix it!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nNo answer, but same problem with iPhone 6 plus--random, self-generated jumping amongst apps and typing on its own--plus freezing regularly (aha--maybe that\\\'s what the ""plus"" in ""6 plus"" refers to?). An Apple Genius recommended upgrading to iOS 11.3.1 from 11.2.2, to see if that fixed the trouble. If it didn\\\'t, Apple will sell me a new phone for $168! Of couese the OS upgrade didn\\\'t fix the problem. Thanks for helping me figure out that it\\\'s most likely a hardware problem--which the ""genius"" probably knows too.\\nI\\\'m getting ready to go Android.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI experienced similar ghost touches. Two weeks ago, I changed my iPhone 6 Plus shell (I had forced the phone into it because it\'s pretty tight), and also put a new glass screen protector (the edges of the protector don\'t stick to the screen, weird, so I brushed pressure on the edges at times to see if they may smooth out one day miraculously). I\'m not sure if I accidentally bend the phone when I installed the shell, or, if I got a defective glass protector that messes up the touch sensor. Well, yesterday was the worse day, keeps dropping calls and ghost pressing keys for me when I was on a call. I got fed up, so I removed the screen protector, and so far problems have not reoccurred yet. I\'m crossing my fingers that problems indeed solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nthank you so much for this post! i was struggling doing the reset because i cannot type userids and passwords correctly because the iphone 6 plus i have kept on typing letters incorrectly. I have been doing it for a day until i come across this article. Very helpful! God bless you!!\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI just turned it off, and turned it back on.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nMy problem has not gone away completely but its better now i changed my charger and turned off prediction ....,,,now it rarely happens\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried all of the above. I then turned off my home cleaned it with isopropyl alcohol 90%. Then I baked it in my oven on warm for an hour and a half over foil. Took it out and set it cool completely on the glass top stove. Then I turned on and it worked.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI think at& t should man up and fix your phone for free! You pay a lot for a Apple they should back it. I did the next 30 month payments and finally have it paid off in June. My iPad sept. Looking forward to a almost 100 drop in my phone bill! Now this crap!!! Really\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nIf your phone is JailBroken, suggest downloading a virus. While all my symptoms were similar, there was indeed a virus/malware on the phone which allowed for remote control of my iphone (even while in lock mode). My mistake for buying a third party iphone i suppose. Anyway i have since had the phone restored to factory and everything is working as expected for now. I will of course keep you posted if this changes. Thanks to all for the helpful posts, really helped me narrow a few things down.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nWhen my phone was doing this, it ended up being the screen protector that i got from 5 below. I took it off and it stopped. I ordered more protectors from amazon and replaced it\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\niPhone 6 Plus first generation.I had the same issues as all above, apps opening by themselves, self typing, ultra sensitive screen, items jumping around all over.it even called someone on FaceTime twice by itself when I was not in the room..I thought the phone was toast and i\'d have to buy a new one took me a while to figure out but it was the extra cheap block plug I bought at a dollar store for convenience of an extra charging station when I move around the house from den to living room..cord was fine but bought a new Apple brand block plugno more problems works just fine now. This issue was a recent event so had to narrow things down to what had changed recently to my phone so I could figure it out.\\nI even had the same problem on a laptop with documents opening up by themselves..a laptop that was plugged in to the same wall plug as my phone charger with the dollar store block plug.until I changed the block plug.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nHad the problem: Inherited a 6s Plus from my wife. She had no problem with it.\\nLooks like it was merely the cheap phone case I purchased on Amazon. It was either pinching the edges or torquing the screen/body of the phone. Problem solved.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI bought my phone on march 6 and it was a brand new, but It sucks me uo because it freezing, shaking and control by itself. I went to the store where I bought this and I told them to replacr it, but they told me I have to pay it because Its about lcd issue. Please help me what other ways to fix it. Or should I try to remove the screen or should I follow your step above.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other Answer\\nI tried everything and it seems to come back to needing the original iPhone cableor at least another 1 that would have come with another iPhonenot the $5 Store fast charging cables.

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered ""controversial"" I really had to see this for myself.The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America.

It doesn\\\'t matter what one\\\'s political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn\\\'t true. I\\\'ve seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don\\\'t exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we\\\'re treated to the site of Vincent Gallo\\\'s throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) ""double-standard"" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won\\\'t see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica.

I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York\\\'s portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He\\\'s small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS\\\' American Masters: Finding Lucy.

Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat\\\'s-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot, which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime, the budding couple\\\'s respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich\\\'s daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on \\\'love\\\' while observing their parents.

Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie\\\'s title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20\\\'s may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. ""They All Laughed"" tries to coast on its good intentions, but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes.Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn\\\'t prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, so there\\\'s no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten\\\'s scenes.

This is a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming.

Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous.

We will cache results for the map-step, but then not freeze it for the combine step. ```python llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"") no_cache_llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", cache=False) ``` ```python from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.chains.mapreduce import MapReduceChain text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter() ``` ```python with open(\'../../../state_of_the_union.txt\') as f: state_of_the_union = f.read() texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union) ``` ```python from langchain.docstore.document import Document docs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts[:3]] from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain ``` ```python chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"", reduce_llm=no_cache_llm) ``` ```python chain.run(docs) ``` ```text CPU times: user 452 ms, sys: 60.3 ms, total: 512 ms Wall time: 5.09 s \'\\n\\nPresident Biden is discussing the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will create jobs and help Americans.

It provides comprehensive features for monitoring, managing models, and improving the performance of your AI applications. ## LLMOps for Langchain Portkey brings production readiness to Langchain. With Portkey, you can - view detailed **metrics & logs** for all requests, - enable **semantic cache** to reduce latency & costs, - implement automatic **retries & fallbacks** for failed requests, - add **custom tags** to requests for better tracking and analysis and [more]( ### Using Portkey with Langchain Using Portkey is as simple as just choosing which Portkey features you want, enabling them via `headers=Portkey.Config` and passing it in your LLM calls. To start, get your Portkey API key by [signing up here]( (Click the profile icon on the top left, then click on ""Copy API Key"") For OpenAI, a simple integration with logging feature would look like this: ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import Portkey # Add the Portkey API Key from your account headers = Portkey.Config( api_key = """" ) llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.9, headers=headers) llm.predict(""What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"") ``` Your logs will be captured on your [Portkey dashboard]( A common Portkey X Langchain use case is to **trace a chain or an agent** and view all the LLM calls originating from that request. ### Tracing Chains & Agents ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import Portkey # Add the Portkey API Key from your account headers = Portkey.Config( api_key = """", trace_id = ""fef659"" ) llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, headers=headers) tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm) agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True) # Let\'s test it out! agent.run(""What was the high temperature in SF yesterday in Fahrenheit? What is that number raised to the .023 power?"") ``` **You can see the requests\' logs along with the trace id on Portkey dashboard:** ![](/img/portkey-dashboard.gif)![](/img/portkey-tracing.png)## Advanced Features 1. **Logging:** Log all your LLM requests automatically by sending them through Portkey. Each request log contains `timestamp`, `model name`, `total cost`, `request time`, `request json`, `response json`, and additional Portkey features. 2. **Tracing:** Trace id can be passed along with each request and is visibe on the logs on Portkey dashboard. You can also set a **distinct trace id** for each request. You can [append user feedback]( to a trace id as well. 3. **Caching:** Respond to previously served customers queries from cache instead of sending them again to OpenAI. Match exact strings OR semantically similar strings. Cache can save costs and reduce latencies by 20x. 4. **Retries:** Automatically reprocess any unsuccessful API requests **upto 5** times. Uses an **exponential backoff** strategy, which spaces out retry attempts to prevent network overload. 5. **Tagging:** Track and audit each user interaction in high detail with predefined tags. | Feature | Config Key | Value (Type) | Required/Optional | | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | | API Key | api_key | API Key (string) | Required | | Tracing Requests | trace_id | Customstring | Optional | | Automatic Retries | retry_count | integer[1,2,3,4,5] | Optional | | Enabling Cache | cache | simpleORsemantic | Optional | | Cache Force Refresh | cache_force_refresh | True | Optional | | Set Cache Expiry | cache_age | integer(in seconds) | Optional | | Add User | user | string | Optional | | Add Organisation | organisation | string | Optional | | Add Environment | environment | string | Optional | | Add Prompt (version/id/string) | prompt | string | Optional | ## Enabling all Portkey Features: ```py headers = Portkey.Config( # Mandatory api_key="""", # Cache Options cache=""semantic"", cache_force_refresh=""True"", cache_age=1729, # Advanced retry_count=5, trace_id=""langchain_agent"", # Metadata environment=""production"", user=""john"", organisation=""acme"", prompt=""Frost"" ) ``` For detailed information on each feature and how to use it, [please refer to the Portkey docs]( If you have any questions or need further assistance, [reach out to us on Twitter.]( - [LLMOps for Langchain](#llmops-for-langchain)- [Using Portkey with Langchain](#using-portkey-with-langchain) - [Tracing Chains & Agents](#tracing-chains--agents) - [Advanced Features](#advanced-features) - [Enabling all Portkey Features:](#enabling-all-portkey-features)']",Yes.,"To add LLM caching in sqlite, you can use the SQLiteCache class.

To use, you should have the redis python package installed and have a running Redis Enterprise or Redis-Stack server For production use cases, it is recommended to use Redis Enterprise as the scaling, performance, stability and availability is much better than Redis-Stack. For testing and prototyping, however, this is not required. Redis-Stack is available as a docker container the full vector search API available. # to run redis stack in docker locally docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest Once running, you can connect to the redis server with the following url schemas: - redis://: # simple connection - redis://:@: # connection with authentication - rediss://: # connection with SSL - rediss://:@: # connection with SSL and auth Examples: The following examples show various ways to use the Redis VectorStore with LangChain. For all the following examples assume we have the following imports: from langchain.vectorstores import Redis from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings Initialize, create index, and load Documentsfrom langchain.vectorstores import Redis from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings rds = Redis.from_documents( documents, # a list of Document objects from loaders or created embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize, create index, and load Documents with metadatards = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize, create index, and load Documents with metadata and return keys rds, keys = Redis.from_texts_return_keys( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) For use cases where the index needs to stay alive, you can initialize with an index name such that it\'s easier to reference later rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_name=""my-index"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Initialize and connect to an existing index (from above) rds = Redis.from_existing_index( embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_name=""my-index"", redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Advanced examples: Custom vector schema can be supplied to change the way that Redis creates the underlying vector schema. This is useful for production use cases where you want to optimize the vector schema for your use case. ex. using HNSW instead of FLAT (knn) which is the default vector_schema = { ""algorithm"": ""HNSW"" } rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object vector_schema=vector_schema, redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) Custom index schema can be supplied to change the way that the metadata is indexed. This is useful for you would like to use the hybrid querying (filtering) capability of Redis. By default, this implementation will automatically generate the index schema according to the following rules: All strings are indexed as text fields All numbers are indexed as numeric fields All lists of strings are indexed as tag fields (joined bylangchain.vectorstores.redis.constants.REDIS_TAG_SEPARATOR) All None values are not indexed but still stored in Redis these arenot retrievable through the interface here, but the raw Redis client can be used to retrieve them. All other types are not indexed To override these rules, you can pass in a custom index schema like the following tag: - name: credit_score text: - name: user - name: job Typically, the credit_score field would be a text field since it\'s a string, however, we can override this behavior by specifying the field type as shown with the yaml config (can also be a dictionary) above and the code below. rds = Redis.from_texts( texts, # a list of strings metadata, # a list of metadata dicts embeddings, # an Embeddings object index_schema=""path/to/index_schema.yaml"", # can also be a dictionary redis_url=""redis://localhost:6379"", ) When connecting to an existing index where a custom schema has been applied, it\'s important to pass in the same schema to the from_existing_index method. Otherwise, the schema for newly added samples will be incorrect and metadata will not be returned. Initialize with necessary components.

73,what does on_tool_start mean?,"['Pairwise string comparison | Pairwise string comparison []( Often you will want to compare predictions of an LLM, Chain, or Agent for a given input. The `StringComparison` evaluators facilitate this so you can answer questions like: - Which LLM or prompt produces a preferred output for a given question? - Which examples should I include for few-shot example selection? - Which output is better to include for fine-tuning? The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `pairwise_string` evaluator. Check out the reference docs for the [PairwiseStringEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are relevant to the question asked, as they both provide a numerical answer to the question about the number of dogs in the park. However, Response A is incorrect according to the reference answer, which states that there are four dogs. Response B, on the other hand, is correct as it matches the reference answer. Neither response demonstrates depth of thought, as they both simply provide a numerical answer without any additional information or context. \\n\\nBased on these criteria, Response B is the better response.\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Methods The pairwise string evaluator can be called using [evaluate_string_pairs]( (or async [aevaluate_string_pairs]( methods, which accept: - prediction (str) The predicted response of the first model, chain, or prompt. - prediction_b (str) The predicted response of the second model, chain, or prompt. - input (str) The input question, prompt, or other text. - reference (str) (Only for the labeled_pairwise_string variant) The reference response. They return a dictionary with the following values: - value: \'A\' or \'B\', indicating whether `prediction` or `prediction_b` is preferred, respectively - score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the \'value\', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `prediction_b` is preferred. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Without References When references aren\'t available, you can still predict the preferred response. The results will reflect the evaluation model\'s preference, which is less reliable and may result in preferences that are factually incorrect. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Addition is a mathematical operation."", prediction_b=""Addition is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers to create a third number, the \'sum\'."", input=""What is addition?"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are correct and relevant to the question. However, Response B is more helpful and insightful as it provides a more detailed explanation of what addition is. Response A is correct but lacks depth as it does not explain what the operation of addition entails. \\n\\nFinal Decision: [[B]]\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Defining the Criteria By default, the LLM is instructed to select the \'preferred\' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms: - [Criteria]( enum or its string value - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions - [Constitutional principal]( - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain - Dictionary: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description. - A list of criteria or constitutional principles - to combine multiple criteria in one. Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style. ```python custom_criteria = { ""simplicity"": ""Is the language straightforward and unpretentious?"", ""clarity"": ""Are the sentences clear and easy to understand?"", ""precision"": ""Is the writing precise, with no unnecessary words or details?"", ""truthfulness"": ""Does the writing feel honest and sincere?"", ""subtext"": ""Does the writing suggest deeper meanings or themes?"", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"", criteria=custom_criteria) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Every cheerful household shares a similar rhythm of joy; but sorrow, in each household, plays a unique, haunting melody."", prediction_b=""Where one finds a symphony of joy, every domicile of happiness resounds in harmonious,"" "" identical notes; yet, every abode of despair conducts a dissonant orchestra, each"" "" playing an elegy of grief that is peculiar and profound to its own existence."", input=""Write some prose about families."", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Response A is simple, clear, and precise. It uses straightforward language to convey a deep and sincere message about families. The metaphor of joy and sorrow as music is effective and easy to understand.\\n\\nResponse B, on the other hand, is more complex and less clear. The language is more pretentious, with words like ""domicile,"" ""resounds,"" ""abode,"" ""dissonant,"" and ""elegy."" While it conveys a similar message to Response A, it does so in a more convoluted way. The precision is also lacking due to the use of unnecessary words and details.\\n\\nBoth responses suggest deeper meanings or themes about the shared joy and unique sorrow in families. However, Response A does so in a more effective and accessible way.\\n\\nTherefore, the better response is [[A]].\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` ## Customize the LLM By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain. You can customize this when loading. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"", llm=llm) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Here is my assessment:\\n\\nResponse B is more helpful, insightful, and accurate than Response A. Response B simply states ""4"", which directly answers the question by providing the exact number of dogs mentioned in the reference answer. In contrast, Response A states ""there are three dogs"", which is incorrect according to the reference answer. \\n\\nIn terms of helpfulness, Response B gives the precise number while Response A provides an inaccurate guess. For relevance, both refer to dogs in the park from the question. However, Response B is more correct and factual based on the reference answer. Response A shows some attempt at reasoning but is ultimately incorrect. Response B requires less depth of thought to simply state the factual number.\\n\\nIn summary, Response B is superior in terms of helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth. My final decision is: [[B]]\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Customize the Evaluation Prompt You can use your own custom evaluation prompt to add more task-specific instructions or to instruct the evaluator to score the output. *Note: If you use a prompt that expects generates a result in a unique format, you may also have to pass in a custom output parser (`output_parser=your_parser()`) instead of the default `PairwiseStringResultOutputParser` ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the input context, which do you prefer: A or B? Evaluate based on the following criteria: {criteria} Reason step by step and finally, respond with either [[A]] or [[B]] on its own line.

B is incorrect as it provides a different name.\\nDepth: Both A and B demonstrate a similar level of depth as they both provide a straightforward answer to the question.\\n\\nGiven these evaluations, the preferred response is:\\n\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` - [Methods](#methods) - [Without References](#without-references) - [Defining the Criteria](#defining-the-criteria) - [Customize the LLM](#customize-the-llm) - [Customize the Evaluation Prompt](#customize-the-evaluation-prompt)', 'Parallelize steps | Parallelize steps RunnableParallel (aka. RunnableMap) makes it easy to execute multiple Runnables in parallel, and to return the output of these Runnables as a map. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableParallel model = ChatOpenAI() joke_chain = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""tell me a joke about {topic}"") | model poem_chain = ( ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(""write a 2-line poem about {topic}"") | model ) map_chain = RunnableParallel(joke=joke_chain, poem=poem_chain) map_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bear""}) ``` ```text {\'joke\': AIMessage(content=""Why don\'t bears wear shoes? \\n\\nBecause they have bear feet!"", additional_kwargs={}, example=False), \'poem\': AIMessage(content=""In woodland depths, bear prowls with might,\\nSilent strength, nature\'s sovereign, day and night."", additional_kwargs={}, example=False)} ``` ## Manipulating outputs/inputs Maps can be useful for manipulating the output of one Runnable to match the input format of the next Runnable in a sequence. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS vectorstore = FAISS.from_texts( [""harrison worked at kensho""], embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings() ) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() template = """"""Answer the question based only on the following context: {context} Question: {question} """""" prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template) retrieval_chain = ( {""context"": retriever, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ) retrieval_chain.invoke(""where did harrison work?"") ``` ```text \'Harrison worked at Kensho.\' ``` Here the input to prompt is expected to be a map with keys ""context"" and ""question"". The user input is just the question. So we need to get the context using our retriever and passthrough the user input under the ""question"" key. Note that when composing a RunnableMap when another Runnable we don\'t even need to wrap our dictionary in the RunnableMap class the type conversion is handled for us. ## Parallelism RunnableMaps are also useful for running independent processes in parallel, since each Runnable in the map is executed in parallel. For example, we can see our earlier `joke_chain`, `poem_chain` and `map_chain` all have about the same runtime, even though `map_chain` executes both of the other two. ```python joke_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bear""}) ``` ```text 958 ms 402 ms per loop (mean std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) ``` ```python poem_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bear""}) ``` ```text 1.22 s 508 ms per loop (mean std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) ``` ```python map_chain.invoke({""topic"": ""bear""}) ``` ```text 1.15 s 119 ms per loop (mean std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each) ``` - [Manipulating outputs/inputs](#manipulating-outputsinputs) - [Parallelism](#parallelism)', 'Conversation Buffer Window | Conversation Buffer Window `ConversationBufferWindowMemory` keeps a list of the interactions of the conversation over time.

75,How can I use OpenAI functions to get structured outputs in a chain?,"['Using OpenAI functions | Using OpenAI functions This walkthrough demonstrates how to incorporate OpenAI function-calling API\'s in a chain. We\'ll go over: 1. How to use functions to get structured outputs from ChatOpenAI 2. How to create a generic chain that uses (multiple) functions 3. How to create a chain that actually executes the chosen function ```python from typing import Optional from langchain.chains.openai_functions import ( create_openai_fn_chain, create_openai_fn_runnable, create_structured_output_chain, create_structured_output_runnable, ) from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate ``` ## Getting structured outputs We can take advantage of OpenAI functions to try and force the model to return a particular kind of structured output. We\'ll use `create_structured_output_runnable` to create our chain, which takes the desired structured output either as a Pydantic class or as JsonSchema. ### Using Pydantic classes When passing in Pydantic classes to structure our text, we need to make sure to have a docstring description for the class. It also helps to have descriptions for each of the classes attributes. ```python from langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field class Person(BaseModel): """"""Identifying information about a person."""""" name: str = Field(..., description=""The person\'s name"") age: int = Field(..., description=""The person\'s age"") fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=""The person\'s favorite food"") ``` ```python # If we pass in a model explicitly, we need to make sure it supports the OpenAI function-calling API. llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"", temperature=0) prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You are a world class algorithm for extracting information in structured formats."", ), ( ""human"", ""Use the given format to extract information from the following input: {input}"", ), (""human"", ""Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format""), ] ) runnable = create_structured_output_runnable(Person, llm, prompt) runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Sally is 13""}) ``` ```text Person(name=\'Sally\', age=13, fav_food=\'Unknown\') ``` To extract arbitrarily many structured outputs of a given format, we can just create a wrapper Pydantic class that takes a sequence of the original class. ```python from typing import Sequence class People(BaseModel): """"""Identifying information about all people in a text."""""" people: Sequence[Person] = Field(..., description=""The people in the text"") runnable = create_structured_output_runnable(People, llm, prompt) runnable.invoke( { ""input"": ""Sally is 13, Joey just turned 12 and loves spinach. Caroline is 10 years older than Sally."" } ) ``` ```text People(people=[Person(name=\'Sally\', age=13, fav_food=\'\'), Person(name=\'Joey\', age=12, fav_food=\'spinach\'), Person(name=\'Caroline\', age=23, fav_food=\'\')]) ``` ### Using JsonSchema We can also pass in JsonSchema instead of Pydantic classes to specify the desired structure. When we do this, our chain will output JSON corresponding to the properties described in the JsonSchema, instead of a Pydantic class. ```python json_schema = { ""title"": ""Person"", ""description"": ""Identifying information about a person."", ""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": { ""name"": {""title"": ""Name"", ""description"": ""The person\'s name"", ""type"": ""string""}, ""age"": {""title"": ""Age"", ""description"": ""The person\'s age"", ""type"": ""integer""}, ""fav_food"": { ""title"": ""Fav Food"", ""description"": ""The person\'s favorite food"", ""type"": ""string"", }, }, ""required"": [""name"", ""age""], } ``` ```python runnable = create_structured_output_runnable(json_schema, llm, prompt) runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Sally is 13""}) ``` ```text {\'name\': \'Sally\', \'age\': 13} ``` ### [Legacy] LLMChain-based approach ```python chain = create_structured_output_chain(Person, llm, prompt, verbose=True) chain.run(""Sally is 13"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: System: You are a world class algorithm for extracting information in structured formats. Human: Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Sally is 13 Human: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format > Finished chain. Person(name=\'Sally\', age=13, fav_food=\'Unknown\') ``` ## Creating a generic OpenAI functions chain To create a generic OpenAI functions chain, we can use the `create_openai_fn_runnable` method. This is the same as `create_structured_output_runnable` except that instead of taking a single output schema, it takes a sequence of function definitions. Functions can be passed in as: - dicts conforming to OpenAI functions spec, - Pydantic classes, in which case they should have docstring descriptions of the function they represent and descriptions for each of the parameters, - Python functions, in which case they should have docstring descriptions of the function and args, along with type hints. ### Using Pydantic classes ```python class RecordPerson(BaseModel): """"""Record some identifying information about a pe."""""" name: str = Field(..., description=""The person\'s name"") age: int = Field(..., description=""The person\'s age"") fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=""The person\'s favorite food"") class RecordDog(BaseModel): """"""Record some identifying information about a dog."""""" name: str = Field(..., description=""The dog\'s name"") color: str = Field(..., description=""The dog\'s color"") fav_food: Optional[str] = Field(None, description=""The dog\'s favorite food"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains.openai_functions import ( convert_to_openai_function, get_openai_output_parser, ) prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a world class algorithm for recording entities.""), ( ""human"", ""Make calls to the relevant function to record the entities in the following input: {input}"", ), (""human"", ""Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format""), ] ) openai_functions = [convert_to_openai_function(f) for f in (RecordPerson, RecordDog)] llm_kwargs = {""functions"": openai_functions} if len(openai_functions) == 1: llm_kwargs[""function_call""] = {""name"": openai_functions[0][""name""]} output_parser = get_openai_output_parser((RecordPerson, RecordDog)) runnable = prompt | llm.bind(**llm_kwargs) | output_parser ``` ```python runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Harry was a chubby brown beagle who loved chicken""}) ``` ```text RecordDog(name=\'Harry\', color=\'brown\', fav_food=\'chicken\') ``` For convenience we can use the `create_openai_fn_runnable` method to help build our Runnable ```python runnable = create_openai_fn_runnable([RecordPerson, RecordDog], llm, prompt) runnable.invoke({""input"": ""Harry was a chubby brown beagle who loved chicken""}) ``` ```text RecordDog(name=\'Harry\', color=\'brown\', fav_food=\'chicken\') ``` ### Using Python functions We can pass in functions as Pydantic classes, directly as OpenAI function dicts, or Python functions. To pass Python function in directly, we\'ll want to make sure our parameters have type hints, we have a docstring, and we use [Google Python style docstrings]( to describe the parameters. **NOTE**: To use Python functions, make sure the function arguments are of primitive types (str, float, int, bool) or that they are Pydantic objects. ```python class OptionalFavFood(BaseModel): """"""Either a food or null."""""" food: Optional[str] = Field( None, description=""Either the name of a food or null. Should be null if the food isn\'t known."", ) def record_person(name: str, age: int, fav_food: OptionalFavFood) -> str: """"""Record some basic identifying information about a person. Args: name: The person\'s name. age: The person\'s age in years. fav_food: An OptionalFavFood object that either contains the person\'s favorite food or a null value. Food should be null if it\'s not known. """""" return f""Recording person {name} of age {age} with favorite food {fav_food.food}!"" runnable = create_openai_fn_runnable([record_person], llm, prompt) runnable.invoke( { ""input"": ""The most important thing to remember about Tommy, my 12 year old, is that he\'ll do anything for apple pie."" } ) ``` ```text {\'name\': \'Tommy\', \'age\': 12, \'fav_food\': {\'food\': \'apple pie\'}} ``` If we pass in multiple Python functions or OpenAI functions, then the returned output will be of the form: ```python {""name"": "">"", ""arguments"": {>}} ``` ```python def record_dog(name: str, color: str, fav_food: OptionalFavFood) -> str: """"""Record some basic identifying information about a dog.

Could you send a message about him?"" } ) ``` ```text {\'name\': \'record_dog\', \'arguments\': {\'name\': \'Henry\', \'color\': \'brown\', \'fav_food\': {\'food\': None}}} ``` ## [Legacy] LLMChain-based approach ```python chain = create_openai_fn_chain([RecordPerson, RecordDog], llm, prompt, verbose=True) chain.run(""Harry was a chubby brown beagle who loved chicken"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

RecordDog(name=\'Harry\', color=\'brown\', fav_food=\'chicken\') ``` ## Other Chains using OpenAI functions There are a number of more specific chains that use OpenAI functions. - [Extraction](/docs/modules/chains/additional/extraction): very similar to structured output chain, intended for information/entity extraction specifically. - [Tagging](/docs/use_cases/tagging): tag inputs. - [OpenAPI](/docs/use_cases/apis/openapi_openai): take an OpenAPI spec and create + execute valid requests against the API, using OpenAI functions under the hood. - [QA with citations](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/qa_citations): use OpenAI functions ability to extract citations from text. - [Getting structured outputs](#getting-structured-outputs)- [Using Pydantic classes](#using-pydantic-classes) - [Using JsonSchema](#using-jsonschema) - [Legacy LLMChain-based approach](#legacy-llmchain-based-approach) - [Creating a generic OpenAI functions chain](#creating-a-generic-openai-functions-chain)- [Using Pydantic classes](#using-pydantic-classes-1) - [Using Python functions](#using-python-functions) - [Legacy LLMChain-based approach](#legacy-llmchain-based-approach-1) - [Other Chains using OpenAI functions](#other-chains-using-openai-functions)', 'Memory in LLMChain | Memory in LLMChain This notebook goes over how to use the Memory class with an `LLMChain`. We will add the [ConversationBufferMemory]( class, although this can be any memory class. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` The most important step is setting up the prompt correctly. In the below prompt, we have two input keys: one for the actual input, another for the input from the Memory class. Importantly, we make sure the keys in the `PromptTemplate` and the `ConversationBufferMemory` match up (`chat_history`). ```python template = """"""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. {chat_history} Human: {human_input} Chatbot:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""chat_history"", ""human_input""], template=template ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend Chatbot: > Finished chain. \' Hi there! How can I help you today?\' ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Not too bad - how are you?"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain... Prompt after formatting: You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. Human: Hi there my friend AI: Hi there! How can I help you today? Human: Not too bad - how are you? Chatbot: > Finished chain. "" I\'m doing great, thanks for asking! How are you doing?"" ``` ## Adding Memory to a chat model-based LLMChain The above works for completion-style `LLM`s, but if you are using a chat model, you will likely get better performance using structured chat messages. Below is an example. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, ) from langchain.schema import SystemMessage ``` We will use the [ChatPromptTemplate]( class to set up the chat prompt. The [from_messages]( method creates a `ChatPromptTemplate` from a list of messages (e.g., `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ChatMessage`, etc.) or message templates, such as the [MessagesPlaceholder]( below.

Show this page source', 'Xata | Xata [Xata]( is a serverless data platform, based on `PostgreSQL` and `Elasticsearch`. It provides a Python SDK for interacting with your database, and a UI for managing your data. With the `XataChatMessageHistory` class, you can use Xata databases for longer-term persistence of chat sessions. This notebook covers: - A simple example showing what `XataChatMessageHistory` does. - A more complex example using a REACT agent that answer questions based on a knowledge based or documentation (stored in Xata as a vector store) and also having a long-term searchable history of its past messages (stored in Xata as a memory store) ## Setup ### Create a database In the [Xata UI]( create a new database. You can name it whatever you want, in this notepad we\'ll use `langchain`. The Langchain integration can auto-create the table used for storying the memory, and this is what we\'ll use in this example. If you want to pre-create the table, ensure it has the right schema and set `create_table` to `False` when creating the class. Pre-creating the table saves one round-trip to the database during each session initialization. Let\'s first install our dependencies: ```bash pip install xata openai langchain ``` Next, we need to get the environment variables for Xata. You can create a new API key by visiting your [account settings]( To find the database URL, go to the Settings page of the database that you have created. The database URL should look something like this: ` ```python import getpass api_key = getpass.getpass(""Xata API key: "") db_url = input(""Xata database URL (copy it from your DB settings):"") ``` ## Create a simple memory store To test the memory store functionality in isolation, let\'s use the following code snippet: ```python from langchain.memory import XataChatMessageHistory history = XataChatMessageHistory( session_id=""session-1"", api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""memory"" ) history.add_user_message(""hi!"") history.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` The above code creates a session with the ID `session-1` and stores two messages in it. After running the above, if you visit the Xata UI, you should see a table named `memory` and the two messages added to it. You can retrieve the message history for a particular session with the following code: ```python history.messages ``` ## Conversational Q&A chain on your data with memory Let\'s now see a more complex example in which we combine OpenAI, the Xata Vector Store integration, and the Xata memory store integration to create a Q&A chat bot on your data, with follow-up questions and history. We\'re going to need to access the OpenAI API, so let\'s configure the API key: ```python import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass(""OpenAI API Key:"") ``` To store the documents that the chatbot will search for answers, add a table named `docs` to your `langchain` database using the Xata UI, and add the following columns: - `content` of type ""Text"". This is used to store the `Document.pageContent` values. - `embedding` of type ""Vector"". Use the dimension used by the model you plan to use. In this notebook we use OpenAI embeddings, which have 1536 dimensions. Let\'s create the vector store and add some sample docs to it: ```python from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores.xata import XataVectorStore embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings() texts = [ ""Xata is a Serverless Data platform based on PostgreSQL"", ""Xata offers a built-in vector type that can be used to store and query vectors"", ""Xata includes similarity search"", ] vector_store = XataVectorStore.from_texts( texts, embeddings, api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""docs"" ) ``` After running the above command, if you go to the Xata UI, you should see the documents loaded together with their embeddings in the `docs` table. Let\'s now create a ConversationBufferMemory to store the chat messages from both the user and the AI. ```python from uuid import uuid4 from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory chat_memory = XataChatMessageHistory( session_id=str(uuid4()), # needs to be unique per user session api_key=api_key, db_url=db_url, table_name=""memory"", ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory( memory_key=""chat_history"", chat_memory=chat_memory, return_messages=True ) ``` Now it\'s time to create an Agent to use both the vector store and the chat memory together. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI tool = create_retriever_tool( vector_store.as_retriever(), ""search_docs"", ""Searches and returns documents from the Xata manual. Useful when you need to answer questions about Xata."", ) tools = [tool] llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` To test, let\'s tell the agent our name: ```python agent.run(input=""My name is bob"") ``` Now, let\'s now ask the agent some questions about Xata: ```python agent.run(input=""What is xata?"") ``` Notice that it answers based on the data stored in the document store. And now, let\'s ask a follow up question: ```python agent.run(input=""Does it support similarity search?"") ``` And now let\'s test its memory: ```python agent.run(input=""Did I tell you my name? What is it?"") ``` - [Setup](#setup)- [Create a database](#create-a-database) - [Create a simple memory store](#create-a-simple-memory-store) - [Conversational Q&A chain on your data with memory](#conversational-qa-chain-on-your-data-with-memory)', 'Fleet AI Libraries Context | Fleet AI Libraries Context The Fleet AI team is on a mission to embed the world\'s most important data. They\'ve started by embedding the top 1200 Python libraries to enable code generation with up-to-date knowledge.

This means the vectors correspond to sections of pages in the LangChain docs, not entire pages. By default, when we spin up a retriever from these embeddings, we\'ll be retrieving these embedded chunks. We will be using Fleet Context\'s `download_embeddings()` to grab Langchain\'s documentation embeddings.

The `MultiQueryRetriever` automates the process of prompt tuning by using an LLM to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input query. For each query, it retrieves a set of relevant documents and takes the unique union across all queries to get a larger set of potentially relevant documents.

In the below prompt, we have two input keys: one for the actual input, another for the input from the Memory class. Importantly, we make sure the keys in the `PromptTemplate` and the `ConversationBufferMemory` match up (`chat_history`). ```python template = """"""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human. {chat_history} Human: {human_input} Chatbot:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""chat_history"", ""human_input""], template=template ) memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") ``` ```python llm = OpenAI() llm_chain = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory, ) ``` ```python llm_chain.predict(human_input=""Hi there my friend"") ``` ```text > Entering new LLMChain chain...

Below is an example. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, ) from langchain.schema import SystemMessage ``` We will use the [ChatPromptTemplate]( class to set up the chat prompt. The [from_messages]( method creates a `ChatPromptTemplate` from a list of messages (e.g., `SystemMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ChatMessage`, etc.) or message templates, such as the [MessagesPlaceholder]( below. The configuration below makes it so the memory will be injected to the middle of the chat prompt, in the `chat_history` key, and the user\'s inputs will be added in a human/user message to the end of the chat prompt. ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=""You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The persistent system prompt MessagesPlaceholder( variable_name=""chat_history"" ), # Where the memory will be stored.

78,hw do i create a prompt template for my chat bot,"['Prompt templates | Prompt templates Prompt templates are pre-defined recipes for generating prompts for language models. A template may include instructions, few-shot examples, and specific context and questions appropriate for a given task. LangChain provides tooling to create and work with prompt templates. LangChain strives to create model agnostic templates to make it easy to reuse existing templates across different language models. Typically, language models expect the prompt to either be a string or else a list of chat messages. ## PromptTemplate Use `PromptTemplate` to create a template for a string prompt. By default, `PromptTemplate` uses [Python\'s str.format]( syntax for templating. ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( ""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."" ) prompt_template.format(adjective=""funny"", content=""chickens"") ``` ```text \'Tell me a funny joke about chickens.\' ``` The template supports any number of variables, including no variables: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke"") prompt_template.format() ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke\' ``` For additional validation, specify `input_variables` explicitly. These variables will be compared against the variables present in the template string during instantiation, **raising an exception if there is a mismatch**. For example: ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate invalid_prompt = PromptTemplate( input_variables=[""adjective""], template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."", ) ``` ```text --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ValidationError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[19], line 3 1 from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ----> 3 invalid_prompt = PromptTemplate( 4 input_variables=[""adjective""], 5 template=""Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}."" 6 ) File ~/langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/load/serializable.py:97, in Serializable.__init__(self, **kwargs) 96 def __init__(self, **kwargs: Any) -> None: ---> 97 super().__init__(**kwargs) 98 self._lc_kwargs = kwargs File ~/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pydantic/main.py:341, in pydantic.main.BaseModel.__init__() ValidationError: 1 validation error for PromptTemplate __root__ Invalid prompt schema; check for mismatched or missing input parameters. \'content\' (type=value_error) ``` You can create custom prompt templates that format the prompt in any way you want. For more information, see [Custom Prompt Templates](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/prompt_templates/custom_prompt_template.html). ## ChatPromptTemplate The prompt to [chat models](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/models/chat) is a list of chat messages. Each chat message is associated with content, and an additional parameter called `role`. For example, in the OpenAI [Chat Completions API]( a chat message can be associated with an AI assistant, a human or a system role. Create a chat prompt template like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", ""You are a helpful AI bot. Your name is {name}.""), (""human"", ""Hello, how are you doing?""), (""ai"", ""I\'m doing well, thanks!""), (""human"", ""{user_input}""), ] ) messages = chat_template.format_messages(name=""Bob"", user_input=""What is your name?"") ``` `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages` accepts a variety of message representations. For example, in addition to using the 2-tuple representation of (type, content) used above, you could pass in an instance of `MessagePromptTemplate` or `BaseMessage`. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import HumanMessagePromptTemplate from langchain.schema.messages import SystemMessage chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ SystemMessage( content=( ""You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to "" ""sound more upbeat."" ) ), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{text}""), ] ) llm = ChatOpenAI() llm(chat_template.format_messages(text=""i dont like eating tasty things."")) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'I absolutely love indulging in delicious treats!\') ``` This provides you with a lot of flexibility in how you construct your chat prompts. ## LCEL `PromptTemplate` and `ChatPromptTemplate` implement the [Runnable interface](/docs/expression_language/interface), the basic building block of the [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/expression_language/). This means they support `invoke`, `ainvoke`, `stream`, `astream`, `batch`, `abatch`, `astream_log` calls. `PromptTemplate` accepts a dictionary (of the prompt variables) and returns a `StringPromptValue`. A `ChatPromptTemplate` accepts a dictionary and returns a `ChatPromptValue`. ```python prompt_val = prompt_template.invoke({""adjective"": ""funny"", ""content"": ""chickens""}) prompt_val ``` ```text StringPromptValue(text=\'Tell me a joke\') ``` ```python prompt_val.to_string() ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke\' ``` ```python prompt_val.to_messages() ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=\'Tell me a joke\')] ``` ```python chat_val = chat_template.invoke({""text"": ""i dont like eating tasty things.""}) ``` ```python chat_val.to_messages() ``` ```text [SystemMessage(content=""You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to sound more upbeat.""), HumanMessage(content=\'i dont like eating tasty things.\')] ``` ```python chat_val.to_string() ``` ```text ""System: You are a helpful assistant that re-writes the user\'s text to sound more upbeat.\\nHuman: i dont like eating tasty things."" ``` - [PromptTemplate](#prompttemplate) - [ChatPromptTemplate](#chatprompttemplate) - [LCEL](#lcel)', 'Chat Bot Feedback Template | Chat Bot Feedback Template This template shows how to evaluate your chat bot without explicit user feedback. It defines a simple chat bot in [chain.py](/docs/templates/chat_bot_feedback/chain.py) and custom evaluator that scores bot response effectiveness based on the subsequent user response. You can apply this run evaluator to your own chat bot by calling `with_config` on the chat bot before serving. You can also directly deploy your chat app using this template. [Chat bots]( are one of the most common interfaces for deploying LLMs. The quality of chat bots varies, making continuous development important. But users are wont to leave explicit feedback through mechanisms like thumbs-up or thumbs-down buttons. Furthermore, traditional analytics such as ""session length"" or ""conversation length"" often lack clarity. However, multi-turn conversations with a chat bot can provide a wealth of information, which we can transform into metrics for fine-tuning, evaluation, and product analytics. Taking [Chat Langchain]( as a case study, only about 0.04% of all queries receive explicit feedback. Yet, approximately 70% of the queries are follow-ups to previous questions. A significant portion of these follow-up queries continue useful information we can use to infer the quality of the previous AI response. This template helps solve this ""feedback scarcity"" problem. Below is an example invocation of this chat bot: []( When the user responds to this ([link]( the response evaluator is invoked, resulting in the following evaluationrun: []( As shown, the evaluator sees that the user is increasingly frustrated, indicating that the prior response was not effective ## LangSmith Feedback [LangSmith]( is a platform for building production-grade LLM applications. Beyond its debugging and offline evaluation features, LangSmith helps you capture both user and model-assisted feedback to refine your LLM application. This template uses an LLM to generate feedback for your application, which you can use to continuously improve your service. For more examples on collecting feedback using LangSmith, consult the [documentation]( ## Evaluator Implementation The user feedback is inferred by custom `RunEvaluator`. This evaluator is called using the `EvaluatorCallbackHandler`, which run it in a separate thread to avoid interfering with the chat bot\'s runtime. You can use this custom evaluator on any compatible chat bot by calling the following function on your LangChain object: ```python my_chain .with_config( callbacks=[ EvaluatorCallbackHandler( evaluators=[ ResponseEffectivenessEvaluator(evaluate_response_effectiveness) ] ) ], ) ``` The evaluator instructs an LLM, specifically `gpt-3.5-turbo`, to evaluate the AI\'s most recent chat message based on the user\'s followup response. It generates a score and accompanying reasoning that is converted to feedback in LangSmith, applied to the value provided as the `last_run_id`. The prompt used within the LLM [is available on the hub]( Feel free to customize it with things like additional app context (such as the goal of the app or the types of questions it should respond to) or ""symptoms"" you\'d like the LLM to focus on. This evaluator also utilizes OpenAI\'s function-calling API to ensure a more consistent, structured output for the grade. ## Environment Variables Ensure that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set to use OpenAI models. Also, configure LangSmith by setting your `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`. ```bash export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=... export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=my-project # Set to the project you want to save to ``` ## Usage If deploying via `LangServe`, we recommend configuring the server to return callback events as well. This will ensure the backend traces are included in whatever traces you generate using the `RemoteRunnable`. ```python from chat_bot_feedback.chain import chain add_routes(app, chain, path=""/chat-bot-feedback"", include_callback_events=True) ``` With the server running, you can use the following code snippet to stream the chat bot responses for a 2 turn conversation. ```python from functools import partial from typing import Dict, Optional, Callable, List from langserve import RemoteRunnable from langchain.callbacks.manager import tracing_v2_enabled from langchain.schema import BaseMessage, AIMessage, HumanMessage # Update with the URL provided by your LangServe server chain = RemoteRunnable("" def stream_content( text: str, chat_history: Optional[List[BaseMessage]] = None, last_run_id: Optional[str] = None, on_chunk: Callable = None, ): results = [] with tracing_v2_enabled() as cb: for chunk in chain.stream( {""text"": text, ""chat_history"": chat_history, ""last_run_id"": last_run_id}, ): on_chunk(chunk) results.append(chunk) last_run_id = cb.latest_run.id if cb.latest_run else None return last_run_id, """".join(results) chat_history = [] text = ""Where are my keys?"" last_run_id, response_message = stream_content(text, on_chunk=partial(print, end="""")) print() chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=text), AIMessage(content=response_message)]) text = ""I CAN\'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE"" # The previous response will likely receive a low score, # as the user\'s frustration appears to be escalating. last_run_id, response_message = stream_content( text, chat_history=chat_history, last_run_id=str(last_run_id), on_chunk=partial(print, end=""""), ) print() chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=text), AIMessage(content=response_message)]) ``` This uses the `tracing_v2_enabled` callback manager to get the run ID of the call, which we provide in subsequent calls in the same chat thread, so the evaluator can assign feedback to the appropriate trace. ## Conclusion This template provides a simple chat bot definition you can directly deploy using LangServe. It defines a custom evaluator to log evaluation feedback for the bot without any explicit user ratings. This is an effective way to augment your analytics and to better select data points for fine-tuning and evaluation. - [LangSmith Feedback](#langsmith-feedback) - [Evaluator Implementation](#evaluator-implementation) - [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) - [Usage](#usage) - [Conclusion](#conclusion)', 'Prompt pipelining | Prompt pipelining The idea behind prompt pipelining is to provide a user friendly interface for composing different parts of prompts together. You can do this with either string prompts or chat prompts. Constructing prompts this way allows for easy reuse of components. ## String prompt pipelining When working with string prompts, each template is joined together. You can work with either prompts directly or strings (the first element in the list needs to be a prompt). ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate ``` ```python prompt = ( PromptTemplate.from_template(""Tell me a joke about {topic}"") + "", make it funny"" + ""\\n\\nand in {language}"" ) ``` ```python prompt ``` ```text PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'language\', \'topic\'], output_parser=None, partial_variables={}, template=\'Tell me a joke about {topic}, make it funny\\n\\nand in {language}\', template_format=\'f-string\', validate_template=True) ``` ```python prompt.format(topic=""sports"", language=""spanish"") ``` ```text \'Tell me a joke about sports, make it funny\\n\\nand in spanish\' ``` You can also use it in an LLMChain, just like before. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=prompt) ``` ```python chain.run(topic=""sports"", language=""spanish"") ``` ```text \'Por qu el futbolista llevaba un paraguas al partido?\\n\\nPorque pronosticaban lluvia de goles.\' ``` ## Chat prompt pipelining A chat prompt is made up a of a list of messages. Purely for developer experience, we\'ve added a convinient way to create these prompts. In this pipeline, each new element is a new message in the final prompt. ```python from langchain.schema import AIMessage, HumanMessage, SystemMessage ``` First, let\'s initialize the base ChatPromptTemplate with a system message. It doesn\'t have to start with a system, but it\'s often good practice ```python prompt = SystemMessage(content=""You are a nice pirate"") ``` You can then easily create a pipeline combining it with other messages _or_ message templates. Use a `Message` when there is no variables to be formatted, use a `MessageTemplate` when there are variables to be formatted. You can also use just a string (note: this will automatically get inferred as a HumanMessagePromptTemplate.) ```python new_prompt = ( prompt + HumanMessage(content=""hi"") + AIMessage(content=""what?"") + ""{input}"" ) ``` Under the hood, this creates an instance of the ChatPromptTemplate class, so you can use it just as you did before! ```python new_prompt.format_messages(input=""i said hi"") ``` ```text [SystemMessage(content=\'You are a nice pirate\', additional_kwargs={}), HumanMessage(content=\'hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'what?\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=\'i said hi\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)] ``` You can also use it in an LLMChain, just like before. ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI ``` ```python model = ChatOpenAI() ``` ```python chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=new_prompt) ``` ```python chain.run(""i said hi"") ``` ```text \'Oh, hello! How can I assist you today?\' ``` - [String prompt pipelining](#string-prompt-pipelining) - [Chat prompt pipelining](#chat-prompt-pipelining)']",Use `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages`.,"To create a prompt template for a chat bot, you can use the `ChatPromptTemplate` class. You can initialize it with a list of chat messages, where each message has a role and content. The role can be 'system', 'human', or 'ai'. For example:

```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ('system', 'You are a helpful AI bot. Your name is {name}.'),
        ('human', 'Hello, how are you doing?'),
        ('ai', 'I'm doing well, thanks!'),
        ('human', '{user_input}'),
    ]
)

messages = chat_template.format_messages(name='Bob', user_input='What is your name?')
```

You can also use different subclasses of the `ChatMessagePromptTemplate` class, such as `SystemMessagePromptTemplate` and `HumanMessagePromptTemplate`, to customize the role or content of specific messages in the template. Finally, you can use the ""MessagesPlaceholder"" class to format chat history as a sequence of messages.",0.9999999999666667,,1.0,0.4749549533009781,0.05714285714285715

80,what does runnable mean,"['Pairwise string comparison | Pairwise string comparison []( Often you will want to compare predictions of an LLM, Chain, or Agent for a given input. The `StringComparison` evaluators facilitate this so you can answer questions like: - Which LLM or prompt produces a preferred output for a given question? - Which examples should I include for few-shot example selection? - Which output is better to include for fine-tuning? The simplest and often most reliable automated way to choose a preferred prediction for a given input is to use the `pairwise_string` evaluator. Check out the reference docs for the [PairwiseStringEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are relevant to the question asked, as they both provide a numerical answer to the question about the number of dogs in the park. However, Response A is incorrect according to the reference answer, which states that there are four dogs. Response B, on the other hand, is correct as it matches the reference answer. Neither response demonstrates depth of thought, as they both simply provide a numerical answer without any additional information or context. \\n\\nBased on these criteria, Response B is the better response.\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Methods The pairwise string evaluator can be called using [evaluate_string_pairs]( (or async [aevaluate_string_pairs]( methods, which accept: - prediction (str) The predicted response of the first model, chain, or prompt. - prediction_b (str) The predicted response of the second model, chain, or prompt. - input (str) The input question, prompt, or other text. - reference (str) (Only for the labeled_pairwise_string variant) The reference response. They return a dictionary with the following values: - value: \'A\' or \'B\', indicating whether `prediction` or `prediction_b` is preferred, respectively - score: Integer 0 or 1 mapped from the \'value\', where a score of 1 would mean that the first `prediction` is preferred, and a score of 0 would mean `prediction_b` is preferred. - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Without References When references aren\'t available, you can still predict the preferred response. The results will reflect the evaluation model\'s preference, which is less reliable and may result in preferences that are factually incorrect. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"") ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Addition is a mathematical operation."", prediction_b=""Addition is a mathematical operation that adds two numbers to create a third number, the \'sum\'."", input=""What is addition?"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Both responses are correct and relevant to the question. However, Response B is more helpful and insightful as it provides a more detailed explanation of what addition is. Response A is correct but lacks depth as it does not explain what the operation of addition entails. \\n\\nFinal Decision: [[B]]\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Defining the Criteria By default, the LLM is instructed to select the \'preferred\' response based on helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth of thought. You can customize the criteria by passing in a `criteria` argument, where the criteria could take any of the following forms: - [Criteria]( enum or its string value - to use one of the default criteria and their descriptions - [Constitutional principal]( - use one any of the constitutional principles defined in langchain - Dictionary: a list of custom criteria, where the key is the name of the criteria, and the value is the description. - A list of criteria or constitutional principles - to combine multiple criteria in one. Below is an example for determining preferred writing responses based on a custom style. ```python custom_criteria = { ""simplicity"": ""Is the language straightforward and unpretentious?"", ""clarity"": ""Are the sentences clear and easy to understand?"", ""precision"": ""Is the writing precise, with no unnecessary words or details?"", ""truthfulness"": ""Does the writing feel honest and sincere?"", ""subtext"": ""Does the writing suggest deeper meanings or themes?"", } evaluator = load_evaluator(""pairwise_string"", criteria=custom_criteria) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""Every cheerful household shares a similar rhythm of joy; but sorrow, in each household, plays a unique, haunting melody."", prediction_b=""Where one finds a symphony of joy, every domicile of happiness resounds in harmonious,"" "" identical notes; yet, every abode of despair conducts a dissonant orchestra, each"" "" playing an elegy of grief that is peculiar and profound to its own existence."", input=""Write some prose about families."", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Response A is simple, clear, and precise. It uses straightforward language to convey a deep and sincere message about families. The metaphor of joy and sorrow as music is effective and easy to understand.\\n\\nResponse B, on the other hand, is more complex and less clear. The language is more pretentious, with words like ""domicile,"" ""resounds,"" ""abode,"" ""dissonant,"" and ""elegy."" While it conveys a similar message to Response A, it does so in a more convoluted way. The precision is also lacking due to the use of unnecessary words and details.\\n\\nBoth responses suggest deeper meanings or themes about the shared joy and unique sorrow in families. However, Response A does so in a more effective and accessible way.\\n\\nTherefore, the better response is [[A]].\', \'value\': \'A\', \'score\': 1} ``` ## Customize the LLM By default, the loader uses `gpt-4` in the evaluation chain. You can customize this when loading. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic llm = ChatAnthropic(temperature=0) evaluator = load_evaluator(""labeled_pairwise_string"", llm=llm) ``` ```python evaluator.evaluate_string_pairs( prediction=""there are three dogs"", prediction_b=""4"", input=""how many dogs are in the park?"", reference=""four"", ) ``` ```text {\'reasoning\': \'Here is my assessment:\\n\\nResponse B is more helpful, insightful, and accurate than Response A. Response B simply states ""4"", which directly answers the question by providing the exact number of dogs mentioned in the reference answer. In contrast, Response A states ""there are three dogs"", which is incorrect according to the reference answer. \\n\\nIn terms of helpfulness, Response B gives the precise number while Response A provides an inaccurate guess. For relevance, both refer to dogs in the park from the question. However, Response B is more correct and factual based on the reference answer. Response A shows some attempt at reasoning but is ultimately incorrect. Response B requires less depth of thought to simply state the factual number.\\n\\nIn summary, Response B is superior in terms of helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth. My final decision is: [[B]]\\n\', \'value\': \'B\', \'score\': 0} ``` ## Customize the Evaluation Prompt You can use your own custom evaluation prompt to add more task-specific instructions or to instruct the evaluator to score the output. *Note: If you use a prompt that expects generates a result in a unique format, you may also have to pass in a custom output parser (`output_parser=your_parser()`) instead of the default `PairwiseStringResultOutputParser` ```python from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template( """"""Given the input context, which do you prefer: A or B? Evaluate based on the following criteria: {criteria} Reason step by step and finally, respond with either [[A]] or [[B]] on its own line.

We recommend using multiple evaluation techniques appropriate to your use case. One way to evaluate an agent is to look at the whole trajectory of actions taken along with their responses. Evaluators that do this can implement the `AgentTrajectoryEvaluator` interface. This walkthrough will show how to use the `trajectory` evaluator to grade an OpenAI functions agent. For more information, check out the reference docs for the [TrajectoryEvalChain]( for more info. ```python from langchain.evaluation import load_evaluator evaluator = load_evaluator(""trajectory"") ``` ## Methods The Agent Trajectory Evaluators are used with the [evaluate_agent_trajectory]( (and async [aevaluate_agent_trajectory]( methods, which accept: - input (str) The input to the agent. - prediction (str) The final predicted response. - agent_trajectory (List[Tuple [AgentAction, str] ]) The intermediate steps forming the agent trajectory They return a dictionary with the following values: - score: Float from 0 to 1, where 1 would mean ""most effective"" and 0 would mean ""least effective"" - reasoning: String ""chain of thought reasoning"" from the LLM generated prior to creating the score ## Capturing Trajectory The easiest way to return an agent\'s trajectory (without using tracing callbacks like those in LangSmith) for evaluation is to initialize the agent with `return_intermediate_steps=True`. Below, create an example agent we will call to evaluate. ```python import subprocess from urllib.parse import urlparse from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import tool from pydantic import HttpUrl @tool def ping(url: HttpUrl, return_error: bool) -> str: """"""Ping the fully specified url.

Note that because of certain interfaces, it\'s often easier to construct the chain first, and then edit the LLM afterwards. As an example, we will load a summarizer map-reduce chain. We will cache results for the map-step, but then not freeze it for the combine step. ```python llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"") no_cache_llm = OpenAI(model_name=""text-davinci-002"", cache=False) ``` ```python from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter from langchain.chains.mapreduce import MapReduceChain text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter() ``` ```python with open(\'../../../state_of_the_union.txt\') as f: state_of_the_union = f.read() texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union) ``` ```python from langchain.docstore.document import Document docs = [Document(page_content=t) for t in texts[:3]] from langchain.chains.summarize import load_summarize_chain ``` ```python chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"", reduce_llm=no_cache_llm) ``` ```python chain.run(docs) ``` ```text CPU times: user 452 ms, sys: 60.3 ms, total: 512 ms Wall time: 5.09 s \'\\n\\nPresident Biden is discussing the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which will create jobs and help Americans.

Two common approaches for this are: 1. `Stuff`: Simply ""stuff"" all your documents into a single prompt. This is the simplest approach (see [here](/docs/modules/chains/document/stuff) for more on the `StuffDocumentsChains`, which is used for this method). 2. `Map-reduce`: Summarize each document on it\'s own in a ""map"" step and then ""reduce"" the summaries into a final summary (see [here](/docs/modules/chains/document/map_reduce) for more on the `MapReduceDocumentsChain`, which is used for this method). ![Image description](/assets/images/summarization_use_case_2-f2a4d5d60980a79140085fb7f8043217.png) ## Quickstart To give you a sneak preview, either pipeline can be wrapped in a single object: `load_summarize_chain`.

Stuff\u200b When we use `load_summarize_chain` with `chain_type=""stuff""`, we will use the [StuffDocumentsChain](/docs/modules/chains/document/stuff).

We can see that we reproduce the earlier result using the `load_summarize_chain`. ### Go deeper\u200b - You can easily customize the prompt. - You can easily try different LLMs, (e.g., [Claude](/docs/integrations/chat/anthropic)) via the `llm` parameter. ## Option 2. Map-Reduce\u200b Let\'s unpack the map reduce approach. For this, we\'ll first map each document to an individual summary using an `LLMChain`. Then we\'ll use a `ReduceDocumentsChain` to combine those summaries into a single global summary. First, we specify the LLMChain to use for mapping each document to an individual summary: ```python from langchain.chains import MapReduceDocumentsChain, ReduceDocumentsChain from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) # Map map_template = """"""The following is a set of documents {docs} Based on this list of docs, please identify the main themes Helpful Answer:"""""" map_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(map_template) map_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=map_prompt) ``` We can also use the Prompt Hub to store and fetch prompts. This will work with your [LangSmith API key]( For example, see the map prompt [here]( ```python from langchain import hub map_prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/map-prompt"") map_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=map_prompt) ``` The `ReduceDocumentsChain` handles taking the document mapping results and reducing them into a single output. It wraps a generic `CombineDocumentsChain` (like `StuffDocumentsChain`) but adds the ability to collapse documents before passing it to the `CombineDocumentsChain` if their cumulative size exceeds `token_max`. In this example, we can actually re-use our chain for combining our docs to also collapse our docs. So if the cumulative number of tokens in our mapped documents exceeds 4000 tokens, then we\'ll recursively pass in the documents in batches of < 4000 tokens to our `StuffDocumentsChain` to create batched summaries. And once those batched summaries are cumulatively less than 4000 tokens, we\'ll pass them all one last time to the `StuffDocumentsChain` to create the final summary. ```python # Reduce reduce_template = """"""The following is set of summaries: {doc_summaries} Take these and distill it into a final, consolidated summary of the main themes. Helpful Answer:"""""" reduce_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(reduce_template) ``` ```python # Note we can also get this from the prompt hub, as noted above reduce_prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/map-prompt"") ``` ```python reduce_prompt ``` ```text ChatPromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'docs\'], messages=[HumanMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=[\'docs\'], template=\'The following is a set of documents:\\n{docs}\\nBased on this list of docs, please identify the main themes \\nHelpful Answer:\'))]) ``` ```python # Run chain reduce_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=reduce_prompt) # Takes a list of documents, combines them into a single string, and passes this to an LLMChain combine_documents_chain = StuffDocumentsChain( llm_chain=reduce_chain, document_variable_name=""docs"" ) # Combines and iteravely reduces the mapped documents reduce_documents_chain = ReduceDocumentsChain( # This is final chain that is called. combine_documents_chain=combine_documents_chain, # If documents exceed context for `StuffDocumentsChain` collapse_documents_chain=combine_documents_chain, # The maximum number of tokens to group documents into. token_max=4000, ) ``` Combining our map and reduce chains into one: ```python # Combining documents by mapping a chain over them, then combining results map_reduce_chain = MapReduceDocumentsChain( # Map chain llm_chain=map_chain, # Reduce chain reduce_documents_chain=reduce_documents_chain, # The variable name in the llm_chain to put the documents in document_variable_name=""docs"", # Return the results of the map steps in the output return_intermediate_steps=False, ) text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0 ) split_docs = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```text Created a chunk of size 1003, which is longer than the specified 1000 ``` ```python print(map_reduce_chain.run(split_docs)) ``` ```text Based on the list of documents provided, the main themes can be identified as follows: 1. LLM-powered autonomous agents: The documents discuss the concept of building agents with LLM as their core controller and highlight the potential of LLM beyond generating written content. They explore the capabilities of LLM as a general problem solver. 2. Agent system overview: The documents provide an overview of the components that make up a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, including planning, memory, and tool use. Each component is explained in detail, highlighting its role in enhancing the agent\'s capabilities. 3. Planning: The documents discuss how the agent breaks down large tasks into smaller subgoals and utilizes self-reflection to improve the quality of its actions and results. 4. Memory: The documents explain the importance of both short-term and long-term memory in an agent system. Short-term memory is utilized for in-context learning, while long-term memory allows the agent to retain and recall information over extended periods. 5. Tool use: The documents highlight the agent\'s ability to call external APIs for additional information and resources that may be missing from its pre-trained model weights. This includes accessing current information, executing code, and retrieving proprietary information. 6. Case studies and proof-of-concept examples: The documents provide examples of how LLM-powered autonomous agents can be applied in various domains, such as scientific discovery and generative agent simulations. These case studies serve as examples of the capabilities and potential applications of such agents. 7. Challenges: The documents acknowledge the challenges associated with building and utilizing LLM-powered autonomous agents, although specific challenges are not mentioned in the given set of documents. 8. Citation and references: The documents include a citation and reference section, indicating that the information presented is based on existing research and sources. Overall, the main themes in the provided documents revolve around LLM-powered autonomous agents, their components and capabilities, planning, memory, tool use, case studies, and challenges. ``` ### Go deeper\u200b **Customization** - As shown above, you can customize the LLMs and prompts for map and reduce stages. **Real-world use-case** - See [this blog post]( case-study on analyzing user interactions (questions about LangChain documentation)! - The blog post and associated [repo]( also introduce clustering as a means of summarization. - This opens up a third path beyond the `stuff` or `map-reduce` approaches that is worth considering. ![Image description](/assets/images/summarization_use_case_3-4247e4011d0a52901288005bfaf20dc1.png) ## Option 3. Refine\u200b [Refine](/docs/modules/chains/document/refine) is similar to map-reduce: The refine documents chain constructs a response by looping over the input documents and iteratively updating its answer. For each document, it passes all non-document inputs, the current document, and the latest intermediate answer to an LLM chain to get a new answer. This can be easily run with the `chain_type=""refine""` specified. ```python chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""refine"") chain.run(split_docs) ``` ```text \'The article explores the concept of building autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) and their potential as problem solvers.

The invoke method takes the input and a config.

chain.invoke( input, config={ 'tags': ['tags1'] }.

If you want to just tag that run (and not propagate the tags to child calls), you can pass the tags in as a list of strings to the call to `load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"", tags=['tag1'])`.

How can I print out the filled out prompts for each model call?","['Fallbacks | Fallbacks When working with language models, you may often encounter issues from the underlying APIs, whether these be rate limiting or downtime. Therefore, as you go to move your LLM applications into production it becomes more and more important to safeguard against these. That\'s why we\'ve introduced the concept of fallbacks. A **fallback** is an alternative plan that may be used in an emergency. Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. This is important because often times different models require different prompts. So if your call to OpenAI fails, you don\'t just want to send the same prompt to Anthropic - you probably want to use a different prompt template and send a different version there. ## Fallback for LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things. Therefore, using fallbacks can help protect against these types of things. IMPORTANT: By default, a lot of the LLM wrappers catch errors and retry. You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying and not failing. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI ``` First, let\'s mock out what happens if we hit a RateLimitError from OpenAI ```python from unittest.mock import patch from openai.error import RateLimitError ``` ```python # Note that we set max_retries = 0 to avoid retrying on RateLimits, etc openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0) anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic() llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm]) ``` ```python # Let\'s use just the OpenAI LLm first, to show that we run into an error with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(openai_llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ```python # Now let\'s try with fallbacks to Anthropic with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content=\' I don\\\'t actually know why the chicken crossed the road, but here are some possible humorous answers:\\n\\n- To get to the other side!\\n\\n- It was too chicken to just stand there. \\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\n- It wanted to show the possum it could be done.\\n\\n- It was on its way to a poultry farmers\\\' convention.\\n\\nThe joke plays on the double meaning of ""the other side"" - literally crossing the road to the other side, or the ""other side"" meaning the afterlife. So it\\\'s an anti-joke, with a silly or unexpected pun as the answer.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` We can use our ""LLM with Fallbacks"" as we would a normal LLM. ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content="" I don\'t actually know why the kangaroo crossed the road, but I can take a guess! Here are some possible reasons:\\n\\n- To get to the other side (the classic joke answer!)\\n\\n- It was trying to find some food or water \\n\\n- It was trying to find a mate during mating season\\n\\n- It was fleeing from a predator or perceived threat\\n\\n- It was disoriented and crossed accidentally \\n\\n- It was following a herd of other kangaroos who were crossing\\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery or environment \\n\\n- It was trying to reach a new habitat or territory\\n\\nThe real reason is unknown without more context, but hopefully one of those potential explanations does the joke justice! Let me know if you have any other animal jokes I can try to decipher."" additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback for Sequences We can also create fallbacks for sequences, that are sequences themselves. Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model). Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt. ```python # First let\'s create a chain with a ChatModel # We add in a string output parser here so the outputs between the two are the same type from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) # Here we\'re going to use a bad model name to easily create a chain that will error chat_model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"") bad_chain = chat_prompt | chat_model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python # Now lets create a chain with the normal OpenAI model from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = """"""Instructions: You should always include a compliment in your response. Question: Why did the {animal} cross the road?"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template) llm = OpenAI() good_chain = prompt | llm ``` ```python # We can now create a final chain which combines the two chain = bad_chain.with_fallbacks([good_chain]) chain.invoke({""animal"": ""turtle""}) ``` ```text \'\\n\\nAnswer: The turtle crossed the road to get to the other side, and I have to say he had some impressive determination.\' ``` ## Fallback for Long Inputs One of the big limiting factors of LLMs is their context window. Usually, you can count and track the length of prompts before sending them to an LLM, but in situations where that is hard/complicated, you can fallback to a model with a longer context length. ```python short_llm = ChatOpenAI() long_llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"") llm = short_llm.with_fallbacks([long_llm]) ``` ```python inputs = ""What is the next number: "" + "", "".join([""one"", ""two""] * 3000) ``` ```python try: print(short_llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text This model\'s maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 12012 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages. ``` ```python try: print(llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text content=\'The next number in the sequence is two.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback to Better Model Often times we ask models to output format in a specific format (like JSON).

RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data. LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). ### What\'s in this guide? LangChain has a number of components specifically designed to help build RAG applications. To familiarize ourselves with these, we\'ll build a simple question-answering application over a text data source. Specifically, we\'ll build a QA bot over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. Along the way we\'ll go over a typical QA architecture, discuss the relevant LangChain components, and highlight additional resources for more advanced QA techniques. We\'ll also see how LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application. LangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in complexity. **Note** Here we focus on RAG for unstructured data. Two RAG use cases which we cover elsewhere are: - [QA over structured data](/docs/use_cases/qa_structured/sql) (e.g., SQL) - [QA over code](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/code_understanding) (e.g., Python) ## Architecture A typical RAG application has two main components: **Indexing**: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. _This usually happen offline._ **Retrieval and generation**: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model. The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like: #### Indexing 1. **Load**: First we need to load our data. We\'ll use [DocumentLoaders](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) for this. 2. **Split**: [Text splitters](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\'t in a model\'s finite context window. 3. **Store**: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a [VectorStore](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/) and [Embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/) model. #### Retrieval and generation 1. **Retrieve**: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a [Retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/). 2. **Generate**: A [ChatModel](/docs/modules/model_io/chat_models) / [LLM](/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data ![flow.jpeg](/assets/images/qa_flow-9fbd91de9282eb806bda1c6db501ecec.jpeg) ## Setup ### Dependencies We\'ll use an OpenAI chat model and embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [ChatModel](/docs/integrations/chat/) or [LLM](/docs/integrations/llms/), [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/), and [VectorStore](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/) or [Retriever](/docs/integrations/retrievers). We\'ll use the following packages: ```bash pip install -U langchain openai chromadb langchainhub bs4 ``` We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so: ```python import getpass import os os.environ[""OPENAI_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() # import dotenv # dotenv.load_dotenv() ``` ### LangSmith Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith]( Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces: ```python os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2""] = ""true"" os.environ[""LANGCHAIN_API_KEY""] = getpass.getpass() ``` ## Quickstart Suppose we want to build a QA app over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents]( blog post by Lilian Weng. We can create a simple pipeline for this in ~20 lines of code: ```python import bs4 from langchain import hub from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma ``` ```python loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs=dict( parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) ), ) docs = loader.load() text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200) splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever() prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python rag_chain.invoke(""What is Task Decomposition?"") ``` ```text \'Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through prompting techniques like Chain of Thought or Tree of Thoughts, or by using task-specific instructions or human inputs. Task decomposition helps agents plan ahead and manage complicated tasks more effectively.\' ``` ```python # cleanup vectorstore.delete_collection() ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ## Detailed walkthrough Let\'s go through the above code step-by-step to really understand what\'s going on. ## Step 1. Load We need to first load the blog post contents. We can use `DocumentLoader`s for this, which are objects that load in data from a source as `Documents`. A `Document` is an object with `page_content` (str) and `metadata` (dict) attributes. In this case we\'ll use the `WebBaseLoader`, which uses `urllib` and `BeautifulSoup` to load and parse the passed in web urls, returning one `Document` per url. We can customize the html -> text parsing by passing in parameters to the `BeautifulSoup` parser via `bs_kwargs` (see [BeautifulSoup docs]( In this case only HTML tags with class ""post-content"", ""post-title"", or ""post-header"" are relevant, so we\'ll remove all others. ```python from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader loader = WebBaseLoader( web_paths=("" bs_kwargs={ ""parse_only"": bs4.SoupStrainer( class_=(""post-content"", ""post-title"", ""post-header"") ) }, ) docs = loader.load() ``` ```python len(docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text 42824 ``` ```python print(docs[0].page_content[:500]) ``` ```text LLM Powered Autonomous Agents Date: June 23, 2023 | Estimated Reading Time: 31 min | Author: Lilian Weng Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver. Agent System Overview# In ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentLoader`: Object that load data from a source as `Documents`. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentLoader`s. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/): Find the relevant `DocumentLoader` integration (of the > 160 of them) for your use case. ## Step 2. Split Our loaded document is over 42k characters long. This is too long to fit in the context window of many models. And even for those models that could fit the full post in their context window, empirically models struggle to find the relevant context in very long prompts. So we\'ll split the `Document` into chunks for embedding and vector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits of the blog post at run time. In this case we\'ll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which will (recursively) split the document using common separators (like new lines) until each chunk is the appropriate size. ```python from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter( chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True ) all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs) ``` ```python len(all_splits) ``` ```text 66 ``` ```python len(all_splits[0].page_content) ``` ```text 969 ``` ```python all_splits[10].metadata ``` ```text {\'source\': \' \'start_index\': 7056} ``` ### Go deeper `DocumentSplitter`: Object that splits a list of `Document`s into smaller chunks. Subclass of `DocumentTransformer`s. - Explore `Context-aware splitters`, which keep the location (""context"") of each split in the original `Document`:- [Markdown files](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA) - [Code (py or js)](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/docs/integrations/document_loaders/source_code) - [Scientific papers](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/grobid) `DocumentTransformer`: Object that performs a transformation on a list of `Document`s. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/): Further documentation on how to use `DocumentTransformer`s - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/document_transformers/) ## Step 3. Store Now that we\'ve got 66 text chunks in memory, we need to store and index them so that we can search them later in our RAG app. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of each document split and upload those embeddings to a vector store. Then, when we want to search over our splits, we take the search query, embed it as well, and perform some sort of ""similarity"" search to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to our query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine similarity we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of embeddings (which are just very high dimensional vectors). We can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command using the `Chroma` vector store and `OpenAIEmbeddings` model. ```python from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings()) ``` ### Go deeper `Embeddings`: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting text to embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/text_embedding/): Browse the > 30 text embedding integrations `VectorStore`: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and querying embeddings. - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/): Further documentation on the interface. - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/): Browse the > 40 `VectorStore` integrations. This completes the **Indexing** portion of the pipeline. At this point we have an query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our blog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return the snippets of the blog post that answer the question: ## Step 4. Retrieve Now let\'s write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple application that let\'s the user ask a question, searches for documents relevant to that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to a model, and finally returns an answer. LangChain defines a `Retriever` interface which wraps an index that can return relevant documents given a string query. All retrievers implement a common method `get_relevant_documents()` (and its asynchronous variant `aget_relevant_documents()`). The most common type of `Retriever` is the `VectorStoreRetriever`, which uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to facillitate retrieval. Any `VectorStore` can easily be turned into a `Retriever`: ```python retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type=""similarity"", search_kwargs={""k"": 6}) ``` ```python retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents( ""What are the approaches to Task Decomposition?"" ) ``` ```python len(retrieved_docs) ``` ```text 6 ``` ```python print(retrieved_docs[0].page_content) ``` ```text Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote. Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like ""Steps for XYZ.\\n1."", ""What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?"", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. ""Write a story outline."" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs. ``` ### Go deeper Vector stores are commonly used for retrieval, but there are plenty of other ways to do retrieval. `Retriever`: An object that returns `Document`s given a text query - [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/): Further documentation on the interface and built-in retrieval techniques. Some of which include:- `MultiQueryRetriever` [generates variants of the input question](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/MultiQueryRetriever) to improve retrieval hit rate. - `MultiVectorRetriever` (diagram below) instead generates [variants of the embeddings](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector), also in order to improve retrieval hit rate. - `Max marginal relevance` selects for [relevance and diversity]( among the retrieved documents to avoid passing in duplicate context. - Documents can be filtered during vector store retrieval using [metadata filters](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/document-context-aware-QA). - [Integrations](/docs/integrations/retrievers/): Integrations with retrieval services. ## Step 5. Generate Let\'s put it all together into a chain that takes a question, retrieves relevant documents, constructs a prompt, passes that to a model, and parses the output. We\'ll use the gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI chat model, but any LangChain `LLM` or `ChatModel` could be substituted in. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", temperature=0) ``` We\'ll use a prompt for RAG that is checked into the LangChain prompt hub ([here]( ```python from langchain import hub prompt = hub.pull(""rlm/rag-prompt"") ``` ```python print( prompt.invoke( {""context"": ""filler context"", ""question"": ""filler question""} ).to_string() ) ``` ```text Human: You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise. Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer: ``` We\'ll use the [LCEL Runnable]( protocol to define the chain, allowing us to - pipe together components and functions in a transparent way - automatically trace our chain in LangSmith - get streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box ```python from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough def format_docs(docs): return ""\\n\\n"".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs) rag_chain = ( {""context"": retriever | format_docs, ""question"": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ) ``` ```python for chunk in rag_chain.stream(""What is Task Decomposition?""): print(chunk, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text Task decomposition is a technique used to break down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps. It can be done through methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts, which involve dividing the task into manageable subtasks and exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. Task decomposition can be performed by AI models with prompting, task-specific instructions, or human inputs. ``` Check out the [LangSmith trace]( ### Go deeper #### Choosing LLMs `ChatModel`: An LLM-backed chat model wrapper.

There are two main things we need to do to support this. 1. Add a messages placeholder to our chain which allows us to pass in historical messages 2. Add a chain that takes the latest user query and reformulates it in the context of the chat history into a standalone question that can be passed to our retriever. Let\'s start with 2. We can build a ""condense question"" chain that looks something like this: ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder condense_q_system_prompt = """"""Given a chat history and the latest user question \\ which might reference the chat history, formulate a standalone question \\ which can be understood without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, \\ just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."""""" condense_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", condense_q_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) condense_q_chain = condense_q_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python from langchain.schema.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""What is meant by large"", } ) ``` ```text \'What is the definition of ""large"" in the context of a language model?\' ``` ```python condense_q_chain.invoke( { ""chat_history"": [ HumanMessage(content=""What does LLM stand for?""), AIMessage(content=""Large language model""), ], ""question"": ""How do transformers work"", } ) ``` ```text \'How do transformer models function?\' ``` And now we can build our full QA chain. Notice we add some routing functionality to only run the ""condense question chain"" when our chat history isn\'t empty. ```python qa_system_prompt = """"""You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \\ Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question. \\ If you don\'t know the answer, just say that you don\'t know. \\ Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.\\ {context}"""""" qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""system"", qa_system_prompt), MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), (""human"", ""{question}""), ] ) def condense_question(input: dict): if input.get(""chat_history""): return condense_q_chain else: return input[""question""] rag_chain = ( RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=condense_question | retriever | format_docs) | qa_prompt | llm ) ``` ```python chat_history = [] question = ""What is Task Decomposition?"" ai_msg = rag_chain.invoke({""question"": question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) chat_history.extend([HumanMessage(content=question), ai_msg]) second_question = ""What are common ways of doing it?"" rag_chain.invoke({""question"": second_question, ""chat_history"": chat_history}) ``` ```text AIMessage(content=\'Common ways of task decomposition include:\\n\\n1.

83,"soooo, is it possible to pass any kwargs for similarity thresholds or K-top documents in the multivectorretriever as we do in normal retrievers?","[""LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) | LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) LangChain Expression Language, or LCEL, is a declarative way to easily compose chains together. LCEL was designed from day 1 to **support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes**, from the simplest prompt + LLM chain to the most complex chains (we've seen folks successfully run LCEL chains with 100s of steps in production). To highlight a few of the reasons you might want to use LCEL: **Streaming support** When you build your chains with LCEL you get the best possible time-to-first-token (time elapsed until the first chunk of output comes out). For some chains this means eg. we stream tokens straight from an LLM to a streaming output parser, and you get back parsed, incremental chunks of output at the same rate as the LLM provider outputs the raw tokens. **Async support** Any chain built with LCEL can be called both with the synchronous API (eg. in your Jupyter notebook while prototyping) as well as with the asynchronous API (eg. in a [LangServe](/docs/langsmith) server). This enables using the same code for prototypes and in production, with great performance, and the ability to handle many concurrent requests in the same server. **Optimized parallel execution** Whenever your LCEL chains have steps that can be executed in parallel (eg if you fetch documents from multiple retrievers) we automatically do it, both in the sync and the async interfaces, for the smallest possible latency. **Retries and fallbacks** Configure retries and fallbacks for any part of your LCEL chain. This is a great way to make your chains more reliable at scale. We're currently working on adding streaming support for retries/fallbacks, so you can get the added reliability without any latency cost. **Access intermediate results** For more complex chains it's often very useful to access the results of intermediate steps even before the final output is produced. This can be used let end-users know something is happening, or even just to debug your chain. You can stream intermediate results, and it's available on every [LangServe](/docs/langserve) server. **Input and output schemas** Input and output schemas give every LCEL chain Pydantic and JSONSchema schemas inferred from the structure of your chain. This can be used for validation of inputs and outputs, and is an integral part of LangServe. **Seamless LangSmith tracing integration** As your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what exactly is happening at every step. With LCEL, **all** steps are automatically logged to [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith/) for maximum observability and debuggability. **Seamless LangServe deployment integration** Any chain created with LCEL can be easily deployed using [LangServe](/docs/langserve)."", 'Add fallbacks | Add fallbacks There are many possible points of failure in an LLM application, whether that be issues with LLM API\'s, poor model outputs, issues with other integrations, etc. Fallbacks help you gracefully handle and isolate these issues. Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. ## Handling LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things. Therefore, using fallbacks can help protect against these types of things. IMPORTANT: By default, a lot of the LLM wrappers catch errors and retry. You will most likely want to turn those off when working with fallbacks. Otherwise the first wrapper will keep on retrying and not failing. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI ``` First, let\'s mock out what happens if we hit a RateLimitError from OpenAI ```python from unittest.mock import patch from openai.error import RateLimitError ``` ```python # Note that we set max_retries = 0 to avoid retrying on RateLimits, etc openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(max_retries=0) anthropic_llm = ChatAnthropic() llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm]) ``` ```python # Let\'s use just the OpenAI LLm first, to show that we run into an error with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(openai_llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ```python # Now let\'s try with fallbacks to Anthropic with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(llm.invoke(""Why did the chicken cross the road?"")) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text content=\' I don\\\'t actually know why the chicken crossed the road, but here are some possible humorous answers:\\n\\n- To get to the other side!\\n\\n- It was too chicken to just stand there. \\n\\n- It wanted a change of scenery.\\n\\n- It wanted to show the possum it could be done.\\n\\n- It was on its way to a poultry farmers\\\' convention.\\n\\nThe joke plays on the double meaning of ""the other side"" - literally crossing the road to the other side, or the ""other side"" meaning the afterlife.

Maybe the kangaroo was trying to get to the other side to find some tasty grass to eat. Or maybe it was trying to get away from a predator or other danger. Kangaroos do need to cross roads and other open areas sometimes as part of their normal activities. Whatever the reason, I\'m sure the kangaroo looked both ways before hopping across!"" additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ### Specifying errors to handle We can also specify the errors to handle if we want to be more specific about when the fallback is invoked: ```python llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks( [anthropic_llm], exceptions_to_handle=(KeyboardInterrupt,) ) chain = prompt | llm with patch(""openai.ChatCompletion.create"", side_effect=RateLimitError()): try: print(chain.invoke({""animal"": ""kangaroo""})) except: print(""Hit error"") ``` ```text Hit error ``` ## Fallbacks for Sequences We can also create fallbacks for sequences, that are sequences themselves. Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model). Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt. ```python # First let\'s create a chain with a ChatModel # We add in a string output parser here so the outputs between the two are the same type from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) # Here we\'re going to use a bad model name to easily create a chain that will error chat_model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"") bad_chain = chat_prompt | chat_model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python # Now lets create a chain with the normal OpenAI model from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = """"""Instructions: You should always include a compliment in your response.

Therefore, as you go to move your LLM applications into production it becomes more and more important to safeguard against these. That\'s why we\'ve introduced the concept of fallbacks. A **fallback** is an alternative plan that may be used in an emergency. Crucially, fallbacks can be applied not only on the LLM level but on the whole runnable level. This is important because often times different models require different prompts. So if your call to OpenAI fails, you don\'t just want to send the same prompt to Anthropic - you probably want to use a different prompt template and send a different version there. ## Fallback for LLM API Errors This is maybe the most common use case for fallbacks. A request to an LLM API can fail for a variety of reasons - the API could be down, you could have hit rate limits, any number of things.

Here we do that with two different models: ChatOpenAI and then normal OpenAI (which does not use a chat model). Because OpenAI is NOT a chat model, you likely want a different prompt. ```python # First let\'s create a chain with a ChatModel # We add in a string output parser here so the outputs between the two are the same type from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ ( ""system"", ""You\'re a nice assistant who always includes a compliment in your response"", ), (""human"", ""Why did the {animal} cross the road""), ] ) # Here we\'re going to use a bad model name to easily create a chain that will error chat_model = ChatOpenAI(model_name=""gpt-fake"") bad_chain = chat_prompt | chat_model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python # Now lets create a chain with the normal OpenAI model from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate prompt_template = """"""Instructions: You should always include a compliment in your response.

Usually, you can count and track the length of prompts before sending them to an LLM, but in situations where that is hard/complicated, you can fallback to a model with a longer context length. ```python short_llm = ChatOpenAI() long_llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"") llm = short_llm.with_fallbacks([long_llm]) ``` ```python inputs = ""What is the next number: "" + "", "".join([""one"", ""two""] * 3000) ``` ```python try: print(short_llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text This model\'s maximum context length is 4097 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 12012 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages. ``` ```python try: print(llm.invoke(inputs)) except Exception as e: print(e) ``` ```text content=\'The next number in the sequence is two.\' additional_kwargs={} example=False ``` ## Fallback to Better Model Often times we ask models to output format in a specific format (like JSON). Models like GPT-3.5 can do this okay, but sometimes struggle. This naturally points to fallbacks - we can try with GPT-3.5 (faster, cheaper), but then if parsing fails we can use GPT-4. ```python from langchain.output_parsers import DatetimeOutputParser ``` ```python prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template( ""what time was {event} (in %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ format - only return this value)"" ) ``` ```python # In this case we are going to do the fallbacks on the LLM + output parser level # Because the error will get raised in the OutputParser openai_35 = ChatOpenAI() | DatetimeOutputParser() openai_4 = ChatOpenAI(model=""gpt-4"") | DatetimeOutputParser() ``` ```python only_35 = prompt | openai_35 fallback_4 = prompt | openai_35.with_fallbacks([openai_4]) ``` ```python try: print(only_35.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text Error: Could not parse datetime string: The Super Bowl in 1994 took place on January 30th at 3:30 PM local time. Converting this to the specified format (%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ) results in: 1994-01-30T15:30:00.000Z ``` ```python try: print(fallback_4.invoke({""event"": ""the superbowl in 1994""})) except Exception as e: print(f""Error: {e}"") ``` ```text 1994-01-30 15:30:00 ``` - [Fallback for LLM API Errors](#fallback-for-llm-api-errors) - [Fallback for Sequences](#fallback-for-sequences) - [Fallback for Long Inputs](#fallback-for-long-inputs) - [Fallback to Better Model](#fallback-to-better-model)']","No, not directly.",You can assign search_kwargs (such as k) to the instance of the MultiVectorRetriever,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This gives all LLMs basic support for async, streaming and batch, which by default is implemented as below: - _Async_ support defaults to calling the respective sync method in asyncio's default thread pool executor. This lets other async functions in your application make progress while the LLM is being executed, by moving this call to a background thread. - _Streaming_ support defaults to returning an `Iterator` (or `AsyncIterator` in the case of async streaming) of a single value, the final result returned by the underlying LLM provider. This obviously doesn't give you token-by-token streaming, which requires native support from the LLM provider, but ensures your code that expects an iterator of tokens can work for any of our LLM integrations. - _Batch_ support defaults to calling the underlying LLM in parallel for each input by making use of a thread pool executor (in the sync batch case) or `asyncio.gather` (in the async batch case).

The table shows, for each integration, which features have been implemented with native support. | Model | Invoke | Async invoke | Stream | Async stream | | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | | AzureChatOpenAI | | | | | | BedrockChat | | | | | | ChatAnthropic | | | | | | ChatAnyscale | | | | | | ChatBaichuan | | | | | | ChatCohere | | | | | | ChatEverlyAI | | | | | | ChatFireworks | | | | | | ChatGooglePalm | | | | | | ChatHunyuan | | | | | | ChatJavelinAIGateway | | | | | | ChatKonko | | | | | | ChatLiteLLM | | | | | | ChatMLflowAIGateway | | | | | | ChatOllama | | | | | | ChatOpenAI | | | | | | ChatVertexAI | | | | | | ChatYandexGPT | | | | | | ErnieBotChat | | | | | | GigaChat | | | | | | JinaChat | | | | | | MiniMaxChat | | | | | | PaiEasChatEndpoint | | | | | | PromptLayerChatOpenAI | | | | | | QianfanChatEndpoint | | | | | - [Features (natively supported)](#features-natively-supported)"", 'Aleph Alpha | Aleph Alpha [The Luminous series]( is a family of large language models.

86,How to use a prompt template with chat history,"['Memory | Memory Most LLM applications have a conversational interface. An essential component of a conversation is being able to refer to information introduced earlier in the conversation. At bare minimum, a conversational system should be able to access some window of past messages directly. A more complex system will need to have a world model that it is constantly updating, which allows it to do things like maintain information about entities and their relationships. We call this ability to store information about past interactions ""memory"". LangChain provides a lot of utilities for adding memory to a system. These utilities can be used by themselves or incorporated seamlessly into a chain. A memory system needs to support two basic actions: reading and writing. Recall that every chain defines some core execution logic that expects certain inputs. Some of these inputs come directly from the user, but some of these inputs can come from memory. A chain will interact with its memory system twice in a given run. 1. AFTER receiving the initial user inputs but BEFORE executing the core logic, a chain will READ from its memory system and augment the user inputs. 2. AFTER executing the core logic but BEFORE returning the answer, a chain will WRITE the inputs and outputs of the current run to memory, so that they can be referred to in future runs. ![memory-diagram](/assets/images/memory_diagram-0627c68230aa438f9b5419064d63cbbc.png) ## Building memory into a system The two core design decisions in any memory system are: - How state is stored - How state is queried ### Storing: List of chat messages Underlying any memory is a history of all chat interactions. Even if these are not all used directly, they need to be stored in some form. One of the key parts of the LangChain memory module is a series of integrations for storing these chat messages, from in-memory lists to persistent databases. - [Chat message storage](/docs/modules/memory/chat_messages/): How to work with Chat Messages, and the various integrations offered. ### Querying: Data structures and algorithms on top of chat messages Keeping a list of chat messages is fairly straight-forward. What is less straight-forward are the data structures and algorithms built on top of chat messages that serve a view of those messages that is most useful. A very simply memory system might just return the most recent messages each run. A slightly more complex memory system might return a succinct summary of the past K messages. An even more sophisticated system might extract entities from stored messages and only return information about entities referenced in the current run. Each application can have different requirements for how memory is queried. The memory module should make it easy to both get started with simple memory systems and write your own custom systems if needed. - [Memory types](/docs/modules/memory/types/): The various data structures and algorithms that make up the memory types LangChain supports ## Get started Let\'s take a look at what Memory actually looks like in LangChain. Here we\'ll cover the basics of interacting with an arbitrary memory class. Let\'s take a look at how to use `ConversationBufferMemory` in chains. `ConversationBufferMemory` is an extremely simple form of memory that just keeps a list of chat messages in a buffer and passes those into the prompt template. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory memory = ConversationBufferMemory() memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` When using memory in a chain, there are a few key concepts to understand. Note that here we cover general concepts that are useful for most types of memory. Each individual memory type may very well have its own parameters and concepts that are necessary to understand. ### What variables get returned from memory Before going into the chain, various variables are read from memory. These have specific names which need to align with the variables the chain expects. You can see what these variables are by calling `memory.load_memory_variables({})`. Note that the empty dictionary that we pass in is just a placeholder for real variables. If the memory type you are using is dependent upon the input variables, you may need to pass some in. ```python memory.load_memory_variables({}) ``` ```text {\'history\': ""Human: hi!\\nAI: what\'s up?""} ``` In this case, you can see that `load_memory_variables` returns a single key, `history`. This means that your chain (and likely your prompt) should expect an input named `history`. You can usually control this variable through parameters on the memory class. For example, if you want the memory variables to be returned in the key `chat_history` you can do: ```python memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` ```text {\'chat_history\': ""Human: hi!\\nAI: what\'s up?""} ``` The parameter name to control these keys may vary per memory type, but it\'s important to understand that (1) this is controllable, and (2) how to control it. ### Whether memory is a string or a list of messages One of the most common types of memory involves returning a list of chat messages. These can either be returned as a single string, all concatenated together (useful when they will be passed into LLMs) or a list of ChatMessages (useful when passed into ChatModels). By default, they are returned as a single string. In order to return as a list of messages, you can set `return_messages=True` ```python memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True) memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(""hi!"") memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(""what\'s up?"") ``` ```text {\'history\': [HumanMessage(content=\'hi!\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False), AIMessage(content=\'what\'s up?\', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)]} ``` ### What keys are saved to memory Often times chains take in or return multiple input/output keys. In these cases, how can we know which keys we want to save to the chat message history? This is generally controllable by `input_key` and `output_key` parameters on the memory types. These default to `None` - and if there is only one input/output key it is known to just use that. However, if there are multiple input/output keys then you MUST specify the name of which one to use. ### End to end example Finally, let\'s take a look at using this in a chain. We\'ll use an `LLMChain`, and show working with both an LLM and a ChatModel. #### Using an LLM ```python from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) # Notice that ""chat_history"" is present in the prompt template template = """"""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human. Previous conversation: {chat_history} New human question: {question} Response:"""""" prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template) # Notice that we need to align the `memory_key` memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"") conversation = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory ) ``` ```python # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` #### Using a ChatModel ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.prompts import ( ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, ) from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory llm = ChatOpenAI() prompt = ChatPromptTemplate( messages=[ SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template( ""You are a nice chatbot having a conversation with a human."" ), # The `variable_name` here is what must align with memory MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history""), HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(""{question}"") ] ) # Notice that we `return_messages=True` to fit into the MessagesPlaceholder # Notice that `""chat_history""` aligns with the MessagesPlaceholder name. memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""chat_history"", return_messages=True) conversation = LLMChain( llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=memory ) ``` ```python # Notice that we just pass in the `question` variables - `chat_history` gets populated by memory conversation({""question"": ""hi""}) ``` ## Next steps And that\'s it for getting started!

This notebook goes over how to store and use chat message history in a `Streamlit` app. `StreamlitChatMessageHistory` will store messages in [Streamlit session state]( at the specified `key=`. The default key is `""langchain_messages""`. - Note, `StreamlitChatMessageHistory` only works when run in a Streamlit app. - You may also be interested in [StreamlitCallbackHandler](/docs/integrations/callbacks/streamlit) for LangChain. - For more on Streamlit check out their [getting started documentation]( You can see the [full app example running here]( and more examples in [github.com/langchain-ai/streamlit-agent]( ```python from langchain.memory import StreamlitChatMessageHistory history = StreamlitChatMessageHistory(key=""chat_messages"") history.add_user_message(""hi!"") history.add_ai_message(""whats up?"") ``` ```python history.messages ``` You can integrate `StreamlitChatMessageHistory` into `ConversationBufferMemory` and chains or agents as usual. The history will be persisted across re-runs of the Streamlit app within a given user session. A given `StreamlitChatMessageHistory` will NOT be persisted or shared across user sessions. ```python from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory from langchain.memory.chat_message_histories import StreamlitChatMessageHistory # Optionally, specify your own session_state key for storing messages msgs = StreamlitChatMessageHistory(key=""special_app_key"") memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=""history"", chat_memory=msgs) if len(msgs.messages) == 0: msgs.add_ai_message(""How can I help you?"") ``` ```python from langchain.chains import LLMChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate template = """"""You are an AI chatbot having a conversation with a human. {history} Human: {human_input} AI: """""" prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[""history"", ""human_input""], template=template) # Add the memory to an LLMChain as usual llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(), prompt=prompt, memory=memory) ``` Conversational Streamlit apps will often re-draw each previous chat message on every re-run. This is easy to do by iterating through `StreamlitChatMessageHistory.messages`: ```python import streamlit as st for msg in msgs.messages: st.chat_message(msg.type).write(msg.content) if prompt := st.chat_input(): st.chat_message(""human"").write(prompt) # As usual, new messages are added to StreamlitChatMessageHistory when the Chain is called. response = llm_chain.run(prompt) st.chat_message(""ai"").write(response) ``` **View the final app.**', 'Elasticsearch | Elasticsearch [Elasticsearch]( is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine, capable of performing both vector and lexical search.

The overall steps are: 1. Download your messenger data to disk. 2. Create the Chat Loader and call `loader.load()` (or `loader.lazy_load()`) to perform the conversion. 3. Optionally use `merge_chat_runs` to combine message from the same sender in sequence, and/or `map_ai_messages` to convert messages from the specified sender to the ""AIMessage"" class. Once you\'ve done this, call `convert_messages_for_finetuning` to prepare your data for fine-tuning. Once this has been done, you can fine-tune your model. To do so you would complete the following steps: 1. Upload your messages to OpenAI and run a fine-tuning job. 2. Use the resulting model in your LangChain app! Let\'s begin. ## 1. Download Data To download your own messenger data, following instructions [here]( IMPORTANT - make sure to download them in JSON format (not HTML). We are hosting an example dump at [this google drive link]( that we will use in this walkthrough. ```python # This uses some example data import zipfile import requests def download_and_unzip(url: str, output_path: str = ""file.zip"") -> None: file_id = url.split(""/"")[-2] download_url = f"" response = requests.get(download_url) if response.status_code != 200: print(""Failed to download the file."") return with open(output_path, ""wb"") as file: file.write(response.content) print(f""File {output_path} downloaded."") with zipfile.ZipFile(output_path, ""r"") as zip_ref: zip_ref.extractall() print(f""File {output_path} has been unzipped."") # URL of the file to download url = ( "" ) # Download and unzip download_and_unzip(url) ``` ```text File file.zip downloaded. File file.zip has been unzipped. ``` ## 2. Create Chat Loader We have 2 different `FacebookMessengerChatLoader` classes, one for an entire directory of chats, and one to load individual files. We ```python directory_path = ""./hogwarts"" ``` ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.facebook_messenger import ( FolderFacebookMessengerChatLoader, SingleFileFacebookMessengerChatLoader, ) ``` ```python loader = SingleFileFacebookMessengerChatLoader( path=""./hogwarts/inbox/HermioneGranger/messages_Hermione_Granger.json"", ) ``` ```python chat_session = loader.load()[0] chat_session[""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=""Hi Hermione!

My summer is going well, though I do miss everyone. I\'m spending most of my time going through my books and researching fascinating new topics. How about you?"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Hermione Granger\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""I miss you all too. The Dursleys are being their usual unpleasant selves but I\'m getting by. At least I can practice some spells in my room without them knowing.

Prepare for fine-tuning Calling `load()` returns all the chat messages we could extract as human messages. When conversing with chat bots, conversations typically follow a more strict alternating dialogue pattern relative to real conversations. You can choose to merge message ""runs"" (consecutive messages from the same sender) and select a sender to represent the ""AI"". The fine-tuned LLM will learn to generate these AI messages. ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.utils import ( map_ai_messages, merge_chat_runs, ) ``` ```python merged_sessions = merge_chat_runs(chat_sessions) alternating_sessions = list(map_ai_messages(merged_sessions, ""Harry Potter"")) ``` ```python # Now all of Harry Potter\'s messages will take the AI message class # which maps to the \'assistant\' role in OpenAI\'s training format alternating_sessions[0][""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [AIMessage(content=""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""What is it, Potter? I\'m quite busy at the moment."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Severus Snape\'}, example=False), AIMessage(content=""I apologize for the interruption, sir. I\'ll be brief. I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False)] ``` #### Now we can convert to OpenAI format dictionaries ```python from langchain.adapters.openai import convert_messages_for_finetuning ``` ```python training_data = convert_messages_for_finetuning(alternating_sessions) print(f""Prepared {len(training_data)} dialogues for training"") ``` ```text Prepared 9 dialogues for training ``` ```python training_data[0][:3] ``` ```text [{\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately.""}, {\'role\': \'user\', \'content\': ""What is it, Potter? I\'m quite busy at the moment.""}, {\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""I apologize for the interruption, sir. I\'ll be brief. I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister.""}] ``` OpenAI currently requires at least 10 training examples for a fine-tuning job, though they recommend between 50-100 for most tasks. Since we only have 9 chat sessions, we can subdivide them (optionally with some overlap) so that each training example is comprised of a portion of a whole conversation. Facebook chat sessions (1 per person) often span multiple days and conversations, so the long-range dependencies may not be that important to model anyhow. ```python # Our chat is alternating, we will make each datapoint a group of 8 messages, # with 2 messages overlapping chunk_size = 8 overlap = 2 training_examples = [ conversation_messages[i : i + chunk_size] for conversation_messages in training_data for i in range(0, len(conversation_messages) - chunk_size + 1, chunk_size - overlap) ] len(training_examples) ``` ```text 100 ``` ## 4. Fine-tune the model It\'s time to fine-tune the model. Make sure you have `openai` installed and have set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` appropriately ```python # %pip install -U openai --quiet ``` ```python import json import time from io import BytesIO import openai # We will write the jsonl file in memory my_file = BytesIO() for m in training_examples: my_file.write((json.dumps({""messages"": m}) + ""\\n"").encode(""utf-8"")) my_file.seek(0) training_file = openai.File.create(file=my_file, purpose=""fine-tune"") # OpenAI audits each training file for compliance reasons. # This make take a few minutes status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""processed"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status print(f""File {training_file.id} ready after {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds."") ``` ```text File file-zCyNBeg4snpbBL7VkvsuhCz8 ready afer 30.55 seconds. ``` With the file ready, it\'s time to kick off a training job. ```python job = openai.FineTuningJob.create( training_file=training_file.id, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) ``` Grab a cup of tea while your model is being prepared. This may take some time! ```python status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""succeeded"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) job = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id) status = job.status ``` ```text Status=[running]... 908.87s ``` ```python print(job.fine_tuned_model) ``` ```text ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::7rDwkaOq ``` ## 5. Use in LangChain You can use the resulting model ID directly the `ChatOpenAI` model class. ```python from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI model = ChatOpenAI( model=job.fine_tuned_model, temperature=1, ) ``` ```python from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages( [ (""human"", ""{input}""), ] ) chain = prompt | model | StrOutputParser() ``` ```python for tok in chain.stream({""input"": ""What classes are you taking?""}): print(tok, end="""", flush=True) ``` ```text The usual - Potions, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts.

Fine-tune the model](#4-fine-tune-the-model) - [5. Use in LangChain](#5-use-in-langchain)']","To run LLaMA 2 in LangChain, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain llama-cpp
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   Configure your environment to use the LLaMA 2 model. This typically involves setting paths to the model files and any necessary environment variables.

3. **Load the LLaMA 2 Model**:
   Use the `LlamaCpp` class from `langchain.llms` to load the LLaMA 2 model. Here's an example:
   ```python
   from langchain.llms import LlamaCpp

   # Specify the path to the LLaMA 2 model file
   model_path = ""/path/to/your/llama2-model.bin""

   # Initialize the LLaMA 2 model
   llm = LlamaCpp(
       model_path=model_path,
       n_gpu_layers=1,  # Adjust based on your hardware
       n_batch=512,     # Adjust based on your hardware
   )
   ```

4. **Use the Model in LangChain**:
   You can now use the `llm` object in your LangChain applications. For example, to perform a simple inference:
   ```python
   input_text = ""Hello, how are you today?""
   output = llm(input_text)
   print(output)
   ```

Make sure to replace `""/path/to/your/llama2-model.bin""` with the actual path to your LLaMA 2 model file. Adjust the `n_gpu_layers` and `n_batch` parameters based on your hardware capabilities.

This should help you get started with running LLaMA 2 in LangChain. If you encounter any issues, refer to the official documentation for more detailed guidance.","Llama 2 can be run through a number of LangChain llm and chat model integrations. A non-exhaustive list includes LlamaCPP, Ollama, Huggingface, Fireworks, and Replicate, HuggingFace. These imports would be
```python
from langchain.llms import Fireworks, HuggingFacePipeline, LlamaCpp, Ollama, Replicate, HuggingFaceHub, HuggingFaceTextGenInference, HuggingFaceEndpoint
from langchain.chat_models import ChatFireworks, ChatOllama

Initializing any of these classes with a parameter pointing to the llama2 model should suffice. Noteably, there is no LangChain class called Llama2, Llama, or Huggingface (with no suffixes). The classes listed above are also case-sensitive.",0.9999999999,1.0,,0.041129823499832775,0.1358024691358025

The overall steps are: 1. Download your messenger data to disk. 2. Create the Chat Loader and call `loader.load()` (or `loader.lazy_load()`) to perform the conversion. 3. Optionally use `merge_chat_runs` to combine message from the same sender in sequence, and/or `map_ai_messages` to convert messages from the specified sender to the ""AIMessage"" class. Once you\'ve done this, call `convert_messages_for_finetuning` to prepare your data for fine-tuning. Once this has been done, you can fine-tune your model. To do so you would complete the following steps: 1. Upload your messages to OpenAI and run a fine-tuning job. 2. Use the resulting model in your LangChain app! Let\'s begin. ## 1. Download Data To download your own messenger data, following instructions [here]( IMPORTANT - make sure to download them in JSON format (not HTML). We are hosting an example dump at [this google drive link]( that we will use in this walkthrough. ```python # This uses some example data import zipfile import requests def download_and_unzip(url: str, output_path: str = ""file.zip"") -> None: file_id = url.split(""/"")[-2] download_url = f"" response = requests.get(download_url) if response.status_code != 200: print(""Failed to download the file."") return with open(output_path, ""wb"") as file: file.write(response.content) print(f""File {output_path} downloaded."") with zipfile.ZipFile(output_path, ""r"") as zip_ref: zip_ref.extractall() print(f""File {output_path} has been unzipped."") # URL of the file to download url = ( "" ) # Download and unzip download_and_unzip(url) ``` ```text File file.zip downloaded. File file.zip has been unzipped. ``` ## 2. Create Chat Loader We have 2 different `FacebookMessengerChatLoader` classes, one for an entire directory of chats, and one to load individual files. We ```python directory_path = ""./hogwarts"" ``` ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.facebook_messenger import ( FolderFacebookMessengerChatLoader, SingleFileFacebookMessengerChatLoader, ) ``` ```python loader = SingleFileFacebookMessengerChatLoader( path=""./hogwarts/inbox/HermioneGranger/messages_Hermione_Granger.json"", ) ``` ```python chat_session = loader.load()[0] chat_session[""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [HumanMessage(content=""Hi Hermione!

My summer is going well, though I do miss everyone. I\'m spending most of my time going through my books and researching fascinating new topics. How about you?"", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Hermione Granger\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""I miss you all too. The Dursleys are being their usual unpleasant selves but I\'m getting by. At least I can practice some spells in my room without them knowing.

Prepare for fine-tuning Calling `load()` returns all the chat messages we could extract as human messages. When conversing with chat bots, conversations typically follow a more strict alternating dialogue pattern relative to real conversations. You can choose to merge message ""runs"" (consecutive messages from the same sender) and select a sender to represent the ""AI"". The fine-tuned LLM will learn to generate these AI messages. ```python from langchain.chat_loaders.utils import ( map_ai_messages, merge_chat_runs, ) ``` ```python merged_sessions = merge_chat_runs(chat_sessions) alternating_sessions = list(map_ai_messages(merged_sessions, ""Harry Potter"")) ``` ```python # Now all of Harry Potter\'s messages will take the AI message class # which maps to the \'assistant\' role in OpenAI\'s training format alternating_sessions[0][""messages""][:3] ``` ```text [AIMessage(content=""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False), HumanMessage(content=""What is it, Potter? I\'m quite busy at the moment."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Severus Snape\'}, example=False), AIMessage(content=""I apologize for the interruption, sir. I\'ll be brief. I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister."", additional_kwargs={\'sender\': \'Harry Potter\'}, example=False)] ``` #### Now we can convert to OpenAI format dictionaries ```python from langchain.adapters.openai import convert_messages_for_finetuning ``` ```python training_data = convert_messages_for_finetuning(alternating_sessions) print(f""Prepared {len(training_data)} dialogues for training"") ``` ```text Prepared 9 dialogues for training ``` ```python training_data[0][:3] ``` ```text [{\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""Professor Snape, I was hoping I could speak with you for a moment about something that\'s been concerning me lately.""}, {\'role\': \'user\', \'content\': ""What is it, Potter? I\'m quite busy at the moment.""}, {\'role\': \'assistant\', \'content\': ""I apologize for the interruption, sir. I\'ll be brief. I\'ve noticed some strange activity around the school grounds at night. I saw a cloaked figure lurking near the Forbidden Forest last night. I\'m worried someone may be plotting something sinister.""}] ``` OpenAI currently requires at least 10 training examples for a fine-tuning job, though they recommend between 50-100 for most tasks. Since we only have 9 chat sessions, we can subdivide them (optionally with some overlap) so that each training example is comprised of a portion of a whole conversation. Facebook chat sessions (1 per person) often span multiple days and conversations, so the long-range dependencies may not be that important to model anyhow. ```python # Our chat is alternating, we will make each datapoint a group of 8 messages, # with 2 messages overlapping chunk_size = 8 overlap = 2 training_examples = [ conversation_messages[i : i + chunk_size] for conversation_messages in training_data for i in range(0, len(conversation_messages) - chunk_size + 1, chunk_size - overlap) ] len(training_examples) ``` ```text 100 ``` ## 4. Fine-tune the model It\'s time to fine-tune the model. Make sure you have `openai` installed and have set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` appropriately ```python # %pip install -U openai --quiet ``` ```python import json import time from io import BytesIO import openai # We will write the jsonl file in memory my_file = BytesIO() for m in training_examples: my_file.write((json.dumps({""messages"": m}) + ""\\n"").encode(""utf-8"")) my_file.seek(0) training_file = openai.File.create(file=my_file, purpose=""fine-tune"") # OpenAI audits each training file for compliance reasons. # This make take a few minutes status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""processed"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file.id).status print(f""File {training_file.id} ready after {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds."") ``` ```text File file-zCyNBeg4snpbBL7VkvsuhCz8 ready afer 30.55 seconds. ``` With the file ready, it\'s time to kick off a training job. ```python job = openai.FineTuningJob.create( training_file=training_file.id, model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"", ) ``` Grab a cup of tea while your model is being prepared. This may take some time! ```python status = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id).status start_time = time.time() while status != ""succeeded"": print(f""Status=[{status}]... {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s"", end=""\\r"", flush=True) time.sleep(5) job = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job.id) status = job.status ``` ```text Status=[running]... 908.87s ``` ```python print(job.fine_tuned_model) ``` ```text ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:personal::7rDwkaOq ``` ## 5.

The tool would then have to handle the parsing logic to extract the relevant values from the text, which tightly couples the tool representation to the agent prompt. This is still useful if the underlying language model can\'t reliably generate structured schema. Let\'s take the multiplication function as an example. In order to use this, we will tell the agent to generate the ""Action Input"" as a comma-separated list of length two. We will then write a thin wrapper that takes a string, splits it into two around a comma, and passes both parsed sides as integers to the multiplication function. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent from langchain.llms import OpenAI ``` Here is the multiplication function, as well as a wrapper to parse a string as input. ```python def multiplier(a, b): return a * b def parsing_multiplier(string): a, b = string.split("","") return multiplier(int(a), int(b)) ``` ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) tools = [ Tool( name=""Multiplier"", func=parsing_multiplier, description=""useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together.

Besides the actual function that is called, the Tool consists of several components: - `name` (str), is required and must be unique within a set of tools provided to an agent - `description` (str), is optional but recommended, as it is used by an agent to determine tool use - `return_direct` (bool), defaults to False - `args_schema` (Pydantic BaseModel), is optional but recommended, can be used to provide more information (e.g., few-shot examples) or validation for expected parameters. There are two main ways to define a tool, we will cover both in the example below. ```python # Import things that are needed generically from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.chains import LLMMathChain from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import BaseTool, StructuredTool, Tool, tool from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper ``` Initialize the LLM to use for the agent. ```python llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) ``` ## Completely New Tools - String Input and Output The simplest tools accept a single query string and return a string output.

This is useful if you want more control over the instance variables or if you want to propagate callbacks to nested chains or other tools. ```python from typing import Optional, Type from langchain.callbacks.manager import ( AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun, CallbackManagerForToolRun, ) class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool): name = ""custom_search"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" def _run( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" return search.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"") class CustomCalculatorTool(BaseTool): name = ""Calculator"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"" args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = CalculatorInput def _run( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" return llm_math_chain.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""Calculator does not support async"") ``` ```python tools = [CustomSearchTool(), CustomCalculatorTool()] agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?"" ) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

This decorator can be used to quickly create a `Tool` from a simple function. The decorator uses the function name as the tool name by default, but this can be overridden by passing a string as the first argument. Additionally, the decorator will use the function\'s docstring as the tool\'s description. ```python from langchain.tools import tool @tool def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return f""Results for query {query}"" search_api ``` You can also provide arguments like the tool name and whether to return directly. ```python @tool(""search"", return_direct=True) def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return ""Results"" ``` ```python search_api ``` ```text Tool(name=\'search\', description=\'search(query: str) -> str - Searches the API for the query.\', args_schema=, return_direct=True, verbose=False, callback_manager=, func=, coroutine=None) ``` You can also provide `args_schema` to provide more information about the argument. ```python class SearchInput(BaseModel): query: str = Field(description=""should be a search query"") @tool(""search"", return_direct=True, args_schema=SearchInput) def search_api(query: str) -> str: """"""Searches the API for the query."""""" return ""Results"" ``` ```python search_api ``` ```text Tool(name=\'search\', description=\'search(query: str) -> str - Searches the API for the query.\', args_schema=, return_direct=True, verbose=False, callback_manager=, func=, coroutine=None) ``` ## Custom Structured Tools If your functions require more structured arguments, you can use the `StructuredTool` class directly, or still subclass the `BaseTool` class. ### StructuredTool dataclass To dynamically generate a structured tool from a given function, the fastest way to get started is with `StructuredTool.from_function()`. ```python import requests from langchain.tools import StructuredTool def post_message(url: str, body: dict, parameters: Optional[dict] = None) -> str: """"""Sends a POST request to the given url with the given body and parameters."""""" result = requests.post(url, json=body, params=parameters) return f""Status: {result.status_code} - {result.text}"" tool = StructuredTool.from_function(post_message) ``` ### Subclassing the BaseTool The BaseTool automatically infers the schema from the `_run` method\'s signature. ```python from typing import Optional, Type from langchain.callbacks.manager import ( AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun, CallbackManagerForToolRun, ) class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool): name = ""custom_search"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" def _run( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" search_wrapper = SerpAPIWrapper(params={""engine"": engine, ""gl"": gl, ""hl"": hl}) return search_wrapper.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"") # You can provide a custom args schema to add descriptions or custom validation class SearchSchema(BaseModel): query: str = Field(description=""should be a search query"") engine: str = Field(description=""should be a search engine"") gl: str = Field(description=""should be a country code"") hl: str = Field(description=""should be a language code"") class CustomSearchTool(BaseTool): name = ""custom_search"" description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"" args_schema: Type[SearchSchema] = SearchSchema def _run( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool."""""" search_wrapper = SerpAPIWrapper(params={""engine"": engine, ""gl"": gl, ""hl"": hl}) return search_wrapper.run(query) async def _arun( self, query: str, engine: str = ""google"", gl: str = ""us"", hl: str = ""en"", run_manager: Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun] = None, ) -> str: """"""Use the tool asynchronously."""""" raise NotImplementedError(""custom_search does not support async"") ``` ### Using the decorator The `tool` decorator creates a structured tool automatically if the signature has multiple arguments. ```python import requests from langchain.tools import tool @tool def post_message(url: str, body: dict, parameters: Optional[dict] = None) -> str: """"""Sends a POST request to the given url with the given body and parameters."""""" result = requests.post(url, json=body, params=parameters) return f""Status: {result.status_code} - {result.text}"" ``` ## Modify existing tools Now, we show how to load existing tools and modify them directly. In the example below, we do something really simple and change the Search tool to have the name `Google Search`. ```python from langchain.agents import load_tools ``` ```python tools = load_tools([""serpapi"", ""llm-math""], llm=llm) ``` ```python tools[0].name = ""Google Search"" ``` ```python agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run( ""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?"" ) ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I need to find out Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend\'s name and her age.

Final Answer: The age of Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend raised to the 0.43 power is approximately 3.55. > Finished chain. ""The age of Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend raised to the 0.43 power is approximately 3.55."" ``` ## Defining the priorities among Tools When you made a Custom tool, you may want the Agent to use the custom tool more than normal tools. For example, you made a custom tool, which gets information on music from your database. When a user wants information on songs, You want the Agent to use `the custom tool` more than the normal `Search tool`. But the Agent might prioritize a normal Search tool. This can be accomplished by adding a statement such as `Use this more than the normal search if the question is about Music, like \'who is the singer of yesterday?\' or \'what is the most popular song in 2022?\'` to the description. An example is below. ```python # Import things that are needed generically from langchain.agents import AgentType, Tool, initialize_agent from langchain.chains import LLMMathChain from langchain.llms import OpenAI from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper search = SerpAPIWrapper() tools = [ Tool( name=""Search"", func=search.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", ), Tool( name=""Music Search"", func=lambda x: ""\'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey."", # Mock Function description=""A Music search engine. Use this more than the normal search if the question is about Music, like \'who is the singer of yesterday?\' or \'what is the most popular song in 2022?\'"", ), ] agent = initialize_agent( tools, OpenAI(temperature=0), agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python agent.run(""what is the most famous song of christmas"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I should use a music search engine to find the answer Action: Music Search Action Input: most famous song of christmas\'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey. I now know the final answer Final Answer: \'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey. > Finished chain. ""\'All I Want For Christmas Is You\' by Mariah Carey."" ``` ## Using tools to return directly Often, it can be desirable to have a tool output returned directly to the user, if it\'s called. You can do this easily with LangChain by setting the `return_direct` flag for a tool to be True. ```python llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm) tools = [ Tool( name=""Calculator"", func=llm_math_chain.run, description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about math"", return_direct=True, ) ] ``` ```python llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) agent = initialize_agent( tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True ) ``` ```python agent.run(""whats 2**.12"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I need to calculate this Action: Calculator Action Input: 2**.12Answer: 1.086734862526058 > Finished chain. \'Answer: 1.086734862526058\' ``` ## Handling Tool Errors When a tool encounters an error and the exception is not caught, the agent will stop executing. If you want the agent to continue execution, you can raise a `ToolException` and set `handle_tool_error` accordingly. When `ToolException` is thrown, the agent will not stop working, but will handle the exception according to the `handle_tool_error` variable of the tool, and the processing result will be returned to the agent as observation, and printed in red. You can set `handle_tool_error` to `True`, set it a unified string value, or set it as a function. If it\'s set as a function, the function should take a `ToolException` as a parameter and return a `str` value. Please note that only raising a `ToolException` won\'t be effective. You need to first set the `handle_tool_error` of the tool because its default value is `False`. ```python from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI from langchain.tools import Tool from langchain.tools.base import ToolException from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper def _handle_error(error: ToolException) -> str: return ( ""The following errors occurred during tool execution:"" + error.args[0] + ""Please try another tool."" ) def search_tool1(s: str): raise ToolException(""The search tool1 is not available."") def search_tool2(s: str): raise ToolException(""The search tool2 is not available."") search_tool3 = SerpAPIWrapper() ``` ```python description = ""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events.You should give priority to using it."" tools = [ Tool.from_function( func=search_tool1, name=""Search_tool1"", description=description, handle_tool_error=True, ), Tool.from_function( func=search_tool2, name=""Search_tool2"", description=description, handle_tool_error=_handle_error, ), Tool.from_function( func=search_tool3.run, name=""Search_tool3"", description=""useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"", ), ] agent = initialize_agent( tools, ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True, ) ``` ```python agent.run(""Who is Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend?"") ``` ```text > Entering new AgentExecutor chain... I should use Search_tool1 to find recent news articles about Leo DiCaprio\'s personal life. Action: Search_tool1 Action Input: ""Leo DiCaprio girlfriend"" Observation: The search tool1 is not available. Thought:I should try using Search_tool2 instead. Action: Search_tool2 Action Input: ""Leo DiCaprio girlfriend"" Observation: The following errors occurred during tool execution:The search tool2 is not available.Please try another tool. Thought:I should try using Search_tool3 as a last resort. Action: Search_tool3 Action Input: ""Leo DiCaprio girlfriend"" Observation: Leonardo DiCaprio and Gigi Hadid were recently spotted at a pre-Oscars party, sparking interest once again in their rumored romance. The Revenant actor and the model first made headlines when they were spotted together at a New York Fashion Week afterparty in September 2022. Thought:Based on the information from Search_tool3, it seems that Gigi Hadid is currently rumored to be Leo DiCaprio\'s girlfriend.
