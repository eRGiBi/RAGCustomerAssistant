I want to save the configuration for a given LLM. Show me how to do that.,"To save the configuration for a given LLM, you can follow these steps:

First, let's go over loading an LLM configuration from disk. LLM configurations can be saved in two formats: JSON or YAML, but they are loaded in the same way.

For a JSON-formatted LLM configuration (llm.json):

```json
{
    ""model_name"": ""text-davinci-003"",
    ""temperature"": 0.7,
    ""max_tokens"": 256,
    ""top_p"": 1.0,
    ""frequency_penalty"": 0.0,
    ""presence_penalty"": 0.0,
    ""n"": 1,
    ""best_of"": 1,
    ""request_timeout"": null,
    ""_type"": ""openai""
}
```

Load the configuration like this:

```python
from langchain.llms.loading import load_llm

llm = load_llm(""llm.json"")
```

For a YAML-formatted LLM configuration (llm.yaml):

```yaml
_type: openai
best_of: 1
frequency_penalty: 0.0
max_tokens: 256
model_name: text-davinci-003
n: 1
presence_penalty: 0.0
request_timeout: null
temperature: 0.7
top_p: 1.0
```

Load the configuration like this:

```python
from langchain.llms.loading import load_llm

llm = load_llm(""llm.yaml"")
```

To save an LLM configuration from memory to a serialized version, you can use the `.save` method. This method supports both JSON and YAML formats:

```python
llm.save(""llm.json"")
llm.save(""llm.yaml"")
```

This way, you can easily save and load LLM configurations to and from disk."

what are the main methods supported by Runnables,"The `runnable` interface in LangChain supports several main methods for interacting with components:

1. `stream`: This method streams back response chunks in real-time, useful for processing large computations or text generation as they become available.

2. `invoke`: Calls the runnable chain on a single input, providing a single response output.

3. `batch`: Calls the runnable chain on a list of inputs, returning a list of corresponding responses.

4. `astream`: Asynchronously streams response chunks back, suitable for handling concurrent tasks.

5. `ainvoke`: Asynchronously calls the runnable chain on a single input and returns the response.

6. `abatch`: Asynchronously calls the runnable chain on a list of inputs, returning a list of corresponding responses."
What is html2texttransformer? Does it omit urls?,"The `Html2TextTransformer` is a class provided by LangChain's `document_transformers` module. It is used to transform HTML content into clean, easy-to-read plain ASCII text.

This transformer is designed to convert HTML pages into human-readable text, making it suitable for scenarios where the goal is to extract content without the need to manipulate specific HTML elements.

If urls are present in the source Document's metadata, then they will be retained. If they are stored in the page_content itself, the class makes no guarantees that they will be retained."
I want to return the source documents of my Weaviate retriever. Show me how,"To retrieve the source documents from your Weaviate vectorstore, you need to configure your client to include the 'sources' attribute. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```python

At minimum, one call will be made to the LLM to (optionally) select a tool or directly respond. For more complex questions or intents, the agent may make many calls."
What are some ways of doing retrieval augmented generation?,"Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a process that involves retrieving external data and using it in the generation step of language models. LangChain provides various building blocks for RAG applications. Here are some ways of doing retrieval augmented generation:

- Document loaders: LangChain offers over 100 document loaders to load documents from different sources, including private S3 buckets and public websites.
- Document transformers: These help in fetching relevant parts of documents by splitting or chunking large documents into smaller chunks.
- Text embedding models: LangChain integrates with over 25 different embedding providers and methods to create embeddings for documents, allowing efficient similarity-based retrieval.
- Vector stores: With the rise of embeddings, LangChain supports over 50 vector stores for efficient storage and searching of embeddings.
- Retrievers: LangChain supports various retrieval algorithms, including semantic search, parent document retriever, self-query retriever, ensemble retriever, and more, to retrieve the data from the database.

These components work together to enable retrieval augmented generation in LangChain. [0] [1]"
whats the difference between a handler and an inheritable_handler?,"In Langchain, both `handler` and `inheritable_handler` are types of callback handlers. Handlers can refer to inheritable handlers or local handlers. Inheritable handlers are propagated to other objects that are called within a Runnable, chain, tool, or other object. Local handlers are only called by the object they are assigned to and not called by any other objects."
What is a chain?,"A 'Chain' is a class in LangChain that composes a number of components together into a single object. An example would be the LLMChain, which formats an input as a prompt, calls an LLM, and then parses the output. ""chaining"" also can generically refer to composing llms, functions, and other operations together into a larger program."
What is LangChain Expression Language?,"LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is a declarative way to easily compose chains together. It provides several benefits for building applications:

- Async, Batch, and Streaming Support: LCEL chains have full sync, async, batch, and streaming support, making it easy to prototype in a Jupyter notebook and then expose it as an async streaming interface.
- Fallbacks: LCEL allows you to easily attach fallbacks to any chain, handling errors gracefully.
- Parallelism: LCEL syntax automatically runs components that can be run in parallel.
- Seamless LangSmith Tracing Integration: LCEL logs all steps to LangSmith for observability and debuggability. [0]

LCEL provides an intuitive and readable syntax for composition and supports streaming, async calls, batching, parallelization, retries, and more. It allows you to combine different components, such as prompts, models, and output parsers, to build powerful applications. LCEL chains can be called synchronously or asynchronously, and they support intermediate result access, input/output schemas, and tracing with LangSmith. [3]"

whats the difference between run_id and example_id,"The `run_id` and `example_id` are both identifiers used in LangChain and LangSmith, but they serve different purposes. The `run_id` is a unique ID assigned to each individual ""run"" in a trace, which represents a unit of work whenever a runnable object such as an LLM or chain is called. An `example_id` is a unique ID assigned to each row (or ""example"") in a LangSmith dataset."
What is an agent,An agent is a component in the Langchain framework that uses a language model (LLM) to determine which actions to take and in what order. It is responsible for making decisions and interacting with tools to accomplish specific objectives.
how do I search and filter metadata in redis vectorstore?,"To perform a similarity search with metadata filtering in LangChain using the Redis vectorstore, you can use Redis filter expressions. The following filter operations are available: RedisText, RedisNum, and RedisTag. Use these when calling `similarity_search()`."
how do I control the maximum number requests that can be made at the same time when making batch calls?,"To limit the maximum number of concurrent requests for batch calls in LangChain, you can call the `.batch()` method and configure the 'max_concurrency' paramater within the runnable config.  For example, the following code calls the chain with a maximum of 2 concurrent calls:
```python
chain.batch([{'topic': 'bears'}, {'topic': 'cats'}, {'topic': 'dogs'}], config={'max_concurrency': 2})

from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache
from langchain.cache import SQLiteCache
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI()

set_llm_cache(SQLiteCache(database_path="".langchain.db""))
llm.invoke(""Tell me a joke"")
```"
how can I create a vectorstore from the texts in the list,"Each LangChain vectorstore class implements a ""from_texts"" class method that accepts a list of string texts, an instance of an `Embeddings` object to embed those texts, and an optional list of metadata dictionaries to add to the resulting documents."
what does on_tool_start mean?,"The on_tool_start method is defined classes that implement LangChain's BaseCallbackHandler interface. When a ""Tool"" object is invoked, and callbacks are provided, the 'on_tool_start' method is called prior to executing the tool itself."
"what does this do? return RunnableBranch(
        (
            RunnableLambda(lambda x: bool(x.get(""chat_history""))).with_config(
                run_name=""HasChatHistoryCheck""
            ),
            conversation_chain.with_config(run_name=""RetrievalChainWithHistory""),
        ),
        (
            RunnableLambda(itemgetter(""question"")).with_config(
                run_name=""Itemgetter:question""
            )
            | retriever
        ).with_config(run_name=""RetrievalChainWithNoHistory""),
    ).with_config(run_name=""RouteDependingOnChatHistory"")","This code defines a runnable chain with two branches. The first branch checks if the input has a 'chat_history' key and runs the conversation_chain if it does. Otherwise uses python stdlib's ""itemgetter"" to get the ""question"" item from the input dictionary. Each ""with_config"" call assigns a friendly ""run_name"" to that step in the traced DAG."
How can I use OpenAI functions to get structured outputs in a chain?,"You can use OpenAI functions to get structured outputs in a chain by using the create_structured_output_runnable function. This function takes the desired structured output either as a Pydantic class or as JsonSchema. If you pass in a model explicitly, make sure it supports the OpenAI function-calling API. You can then invoke the runnable with the input data, and it will return the structured output. You can also use the bind_functions() method on the ChatOpenAI class to do this directly from an instance of ChatOpenAI."
whats the diff between a docstore and a vector store in langchain?,"Vector stores implement the VectorStore interface, which exposes a way to search using similarity search (based on embedding or vector similarity). Doc stores implement the DocStore interface, which allows a search() method to return documents, but this needn't use vector similarity."
"Will this work?

```
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model=""claude-2"")
llm.predict(""Hi"")
```",No. Claude-2 is a closed-source model developed by Anthropic. The ChatOpenAI class interfaces with OpenAI's chat models.
hw do i create a prompt template for my chat bot,"To create a prompt template for a chat bot, you can use the `ChatPromptTemplate` class. You can initialize it with a list of chat messages, where each message has a role and content. The role can be 'system', 'human', or 'ai'. For example:

```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ('system', 'You are a helpful AI bot. Your name is {name}.'),
        ('human', 'Hello, how are you doing?'),
        ('ai', 'I'm doing well, thanks!'),
        ('human', '{user_input}'),
    ]
)

messages = chat_template.format_messages(name='Bob', user_input='What is your name?')
```

You can also use different subclasses of the `ChatMessagePromptTemplate` class, such as `SystemMessagePromptTemplate` and `HumanMessagePromptTemplate`, to customize the role or content of specific messages in the template. Finally, you can use the ""MessagesPlaceholder"" class to format chat history as a sequence of messages."
what method should subclasses override if they can start producing output while input is still being generated,Subclasses should override the transform() method if they can start producing output while input is still being generated.
what does runnable mean,"In the context of LangChain, runnable's are the building blocks of the LangChain Expression Language. They implement the ""Runnable"" base class and represent a unit of work that can be invoked, batched, streamed, transformed and composed."
"I am summarizing text contained in the variable chunks with load_summarize_chain.

chain = load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"")
chain.run(chunks)
I would like to add a tag when I run the chain that langsmith will capture. How?","all chains inherit from the runnable interface. So they support an invoke method. The invoke method takes the input and a config.
For the config you can pass in { 'tags': [ 'tag1' ] }.

chain.invoke( input, config={ 'tags': ['tags1'] }.

If you want to just tag that run (and not propagate the tags to child calls), you can pass the tags in as a list of strings to the call to `load_summarize_chain(llm, chain_type=""map_reduce"", tags=['tag1'])`.
For older methods in the LangChain API like run, __call__, etc. you can also add tags directly when calling, such as with `chain.run(""foo"", tags=['tag1])`."
"Let's say I have a chain like:

model_call_1 = (
  RunnablePassthrough()
  | prompt
  | model_parser
)
# ...
chain = model_call_1 #| { ""attr"": model_call_2 } | model_call_3
How can I print out the filled out prompts for each model call?","There are a few options. You can use set_debug(True) to print out each run to the console:
```
from langchain.globals import set_debug

set_debug(True)
```
This uses the ConsoleCallbackHandler. You can also trace with LangSmith by configuring your environment:

```
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=""Your API Key""
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
```"
"soooo, is it possible to pass any kwargs for similarity thresholds or K-top documents in the multivectorretriever as we do in normal retrievers?",You can assign search_kwargs (such as k) to the instance of the MultiVectorRetriever
whats the stuff documents chain?,"The stuff documents chain (""stuff"" as in ""to stuff"" or ""to fill"") is the most straightforward of the document chains. It takes a list of documents, inserts them all into a prompt and passes that prompt to an LLM.

This chain is well-suited for applications where documents are small and only a few are passed in for most calls."
Does AlephAlpha support token-level streaming natively in LangChain?,"No, while the stream() method is provided in all langchain runnables, AlephAlpha doesn't natively implement streaming on the token level."
How to use a prompt template with chat history,"To add chat history to a prompt template, you can use the MessagesPlaceholder class.

```
from langchain.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder, ChatPromptTemplate

chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (""system"", ""You are a helpful AI bot.""),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=""chat_history"")
        (""human"", ""{input}""),
    ]
)

How do i run llama 2 in langchain,"Llama 2 can be run through a number of LangChain llm and chat model integrations. A non-exhaustive list includes LlamaCPP, Ollama, Huggingface, Fireworks, and Replicate, HuggingFace. These imports would be
```python
from langchain.llms import Fireworks, HuggingFacePipeline, LlamaCpp, Ollama, Replicate, HuggingFaceHub, HuggingFaceTextGenInference, HuggingFaceEndpoint
from langchain.chat_models import ChatFireworks, ChatOllama
```

Initializing any of these classes with a parameter pointing to the llama2 model should suffice. Noteably, there is no LangChain class called Llama2, Llama, or Huggingface (with no suffixes). The classes listed above are also case-sensitive."
What's the difference between the OpenAI and ChatOpenAI classes?,"OpenAI wraps OpenAI's completions endpoint, whereas the ChatOpenAI class wraps the chat endpoint. Both interfadce with LLM's, but the interface chat models is structured as chat messages, which contain information about the role of speaker. Examples of roles include system, human/user, and AI/assistant."
how do i run llama on vllm,"You can run HuggingFace models in vLLM, so you can select the model name of a compatible Llama model then use the VLLM class in LangChain:
 ```python
from langchain.llms import VLLM

llm = VLLM(
    model=""name-of-llama-model"",
    trust_remote_code=True,  # mandatory for hf models
)

print(llm(""What is the capital of France ?""))
